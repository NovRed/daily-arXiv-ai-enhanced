*Juexiao Zhou,Zhongyi Han,Mankun Xin,Xingwei He,Guotao Wang,Jiaoyan Song,Gongning Luo,Wenjia He,Xintong Li,Yuetan Chu,Juanwen Chen,Bo Wang,Xia Wu,Wenwen Duan,Zhixia Guo,Liyan Bai,Yilin Pan,Xuefei Bi,Lu Liu,Long Feng,Xiaonan He,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DigitalShadow is a passive, contactless early warning system for coronary artery disease (CAD) using facial analysis, trained on millions of images to provide personalized risk reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global challenge of CAD, a leading cause of death, by enabling early detection and proactive management through non-invasive methods.

Method: Uses a fine-tuned facial foundation model (LiveCAD) trained on 21M images, then specialized with 7,004 images from 1,751 subjects. Analyzes live video streams for facial features.

Result: Generates natural language risk reports and health recommendations, with local deployment ensuring data privacy.

Conclusion: DigitalShadow offers a scalable, privacy-focused solution for early CAD detection, leveraging facial analysis for passive monitoring.

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

### [2] [Exploring Adversarial Watermarking in Transformer-Based Models: Transferability and Robustness Against Defense Mechanism for Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06389)
*Rifat Sadik,Tanvir Rahman,Arpan Bhattacharjee,Bikash Chandra Halder,Ismail Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial watermarking in dermatological image analysis, comparing their susceptibility to CNNs and evaluating adversarial training as a defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of ViTs in medical imaging, particularly against adversarial attacks, given their growing use in computer vision tasks.

Method: Adversarial watermarks are generated using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and their impact on ViTs and CNNs is tested. Adversarial training is evaluated as a defense.

Result: ViTs show significant vulnerability to adversarial attacks (accuracy drops to 27.6%), but adversarial training improves robustness (accuracy rises to 90.0%).

Conclusion: ViTs are more susceptible to adversarial attacks than CNNs in medical imaging, but adversarial training effectively mitigates this vulnerability.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

### [3] [(LiFT) Lightweight Fitness Transformer: A language-vision model for Remote Monitoring of Physical Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06480)
*A. Postlmayr,P. Cosman,S. Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fitness tracking system using an RGB smartphone camera for remote exercise monitoring, offering privacy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It outperforms prior work with a multitask model handling hundreds of exercises and achieves high accuracy in detection and repetition counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fitness tracking models are limited in exercise variety or too complex for real-world use. The goal is to create a scalable, private, and cost-effective solution.

Method: Developed a robust multitask motion analysis model trained on Olympia, a large-scale dataset of 1,900+ exercises. Uses a vision-language transformer for exercise detection and repetition counting.

Result: Achieves 76.5% accuracy in exercise detection and 85.3% off-by-one accuracy in repetition counting using RGB video.

Conclusion: The system democratizes AI-powered fitness tracking by combining exercise identification and rep counting in a single model, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

### [4] [GS4: Generalizable Sparse Splatting Semantic SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06517)
*Mingqi Jiang,Chanho Kim,Chen Ziwen,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel generalizable Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based semantic SLAM algorithm is introduced, improving 3D mapping efficiency and accuracy while integrating semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM and existing GS-based methods lack generalization and efficiency in 3D map building.

Method: Uses a learned network to predict Gaussian parameters from RGB-D images, integrates semantic segmentation, and optimizes GS with minimal iterations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet with fewer Gaussians and generalizes well to NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances semantic SLAM by combining efficiency, accuracy, and generalization.

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

### [5] [Bridging Audio and Vision: Zero-Shot Audiovisual Segmentation by Connecting Pretrained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06537)
*Seung-jae Lee,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot AVS framework is proposed, leveraging pretrained models to segment sound sources without task-specific training or costly annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AVS methods require expensive pixel-level annotations, prompting the need for a cost-effective, annotation-free solution.

Method: The framework integrates audio, vision, and text representations from pretrained models to bridge modality gaps and enable precise segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration of pretrained models effectively enables fine-grained audiovisual segmentation without task-specific training.

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

### [6] [Securing Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06563)
*Thushari Hapuarachchi,Long Dang,Kaiqi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of DNNs in traffic sign recognition against error-minimizing attacks, proposes a mitigation method using data augmentation, and introduces a detection model for poisoned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs for traffic sign recognition are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, necessitating methods to ensure model security and robustness.

Method: The study performs error-minimizing attacks on DNNs, proposes a data augmentation-based training method to disrupt perturbations, and develops a detection model for poisoned data.

Result: Error-minimizing attacks reduce accuracy from 99.90% to 10.6%, but the mitigation method restores it to 96.05%. The detection model achieves over 99% success in identifying attacks.

Conclusion: Advanced training methods and detection models are essential to mitigate data poisoning effects in traffic sign recognition systems.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

### [7] [Textile Analysis for Recycling Automation using Transfer Learning and Zero-Shot Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06569)
*Yannis Spyridis,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using RGB images and deep learning for textile classification and contaminant segmentation in recycling, achieving high accuracy with EfficientNetB0 (81.25%) and a zero-shot approach (mIoU 0.90).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated textile recycling faces challenges in material identification and contaminant detection, prompting the use of cost-effective RGB imagery.

Method: Evaluated pre-trained models for textile classification (transfer learning) and used Grounding DINO + Segment Anything Model for zero-shot contaminant segmentation.

Result: EfficientNetB0 achieved 81.25% accuracy in classification; zero-shot segmentation scored mIoU 0.90.

Conclusion: RGB images with deep learning (transfer learning and foundation models) are feasible for automated textile recycling tasks.

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

### [8] [A Deep Learning Approach for Facial Attribute Manipulation and Reconstruction in Surveillance and Reconnaissance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06578)
*Anees Nashath Shaik,Barbara Villarini,Vasileios Argyriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven platform using GANs and autoencoders enhances facial recognition in surveillance by generating diverse synthetic data and improving image quality, reducing bias and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases and limitations in AI-based facial recognition due to low-quality images, occlusions, and lack of dataset diversity.

Method: Leverages deep learning (autoencoders and GANs) for synthetic data generation and integrates an image enhancement module for surveillance footage.

Result: Improved training data diversity and model fairness, validated on the CelebA dataset.

Conclusion: The platform reduces bias and enhances surveillance accuracy, leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

### [9] [EV-LayerSegNet: Self-supervised Motion Segmentation using Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06596)
*Youssef Farah,Federico Paredes-Vallés,Guido De Croon,Muhammad Ahmed Humais,Hussain Sajwani,Yahya Zweiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EV-LayerSegNet is a self-supervised CNN for event-based motion segmentation, using affine optical flow and segmentation masks to deblur events, achieving 71% IoU and 87% detection rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training event-based networks is challenging due to expensive and error-prone ground truth acquisition.

Method: Uses a layered scene representation to learn affine optical flow and segmentation masks separately, measuring deblurring quality as a self-supervised loss.

Result: Achieves 71% IoU and 87% detection rate on a simulated dataset with affine motion.

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet demonstrates effective self-supervised learning for event-based motion segmentation.

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

### [10] [RARL: Improving Medical VLM Reasoning and Generalization with Reinforcement Learning and LoRA under Data and Hardware Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06600)
*Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RARL, a Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, to enhance medical VLMs' reasoning, efficiency, and adaptability in low-resource settings, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs lack generalization, transparency, and computational efficiency, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: RARL fine-tunes Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward functions for diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality, trained on a single GPU.

Result: RARL improves VLM performance by ~7.78% in reasoning tasks, with ~27% better generalization on unseen datasets, using fewer resources.

Conclusion: Reasoning-guided learning and prompting enhance medical VLMs' transparency, accuracy, and efficiency, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

### [11] [Zero Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06602)
*Santhosh Kakarla,Gautama Shastry Bulusu Venkata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves zero-shot composed image retrieval (CIR) by fine-tuning BLIP-2 with a Q-Former, achieving significant performance gains. It also evaluates Retrieval-DPO, which underperforms due to several limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of zero-shot CIR by addressing its low recall rates and exploring the limitations of alternative methods like Retrieval-DPO.

Method: Fine-tunes BLIP-2 with a lightweight Q-Former for joint image-text fusion and evaluates Retrieval-DPO with a Direct Preference Optimization loss.

Result: BLIP-2 with Q-Former achieves Recall@10 of 45.6% (shirt), 40.1% (dress), and 50.4% (top-tee), while Retrieval-DPO fails with only 0.02% Recall@10.

Conclusion: Effective CIR requires multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and high-quality negatives, as demonstrated by the success of BLIP-2 and the failure of Retrieval-DPO.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

### [12] [PhysLab: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-Granularity Visual Parsing of Physics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06631)
*Minghao Zou,Qingtian Zeng,Yongping Miao,Shangkun Liu,Zilong Wang,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysLab is a new video dataset for fine-grained visual parsing in educational scenarios, featuring physics experiments with multilevel annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack granularity, domain coverage, and procedural guidance, limiting progress in visual parsing for educational applications.

Method: PhysLab includes 620 long-form videos of physics experiments with diverse instruments and HOI patterns, annotated for various vision tasks.

Result: The dataset supports action recognition, object detection, and HOI analysis, with strong baselines and evaluations highlighting parsing challenges.

Conclusion: PhysLab aims to advance fine-grained visual parsing and integrate computer vision with educational technologies, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The
dataset and the evaluation toolkit are publicly available at
https://github.com/ZMH-SDUST/PhysLab.

### [13] [Dark Channel-Assisted Depth-from-Defocus from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06643)
*Moushumi Medhi,Rajiv Ranjan Sahay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the dark channel prior to estimate depth from a single defocused image, improving upon traditional multi-image DFD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques require multiple images, but this paper addresses the underconstrained problem of single-image DFD by leveraging the dark channel prior.

Method: The method uses local defocus blur and contrast variations as depth cues, trained adversarially in an end-to-end pipeline.

Result: Experiments on real data show meaningful depth estimation results, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating the dark channel prior enhances single-image DFD performance effectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: PGHM integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast, high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos, improving efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for photorealistic human avatars are time-consuming and struggle with sparse inputs. PGHM aims to address these challenges.

Method: PGHM uses a UV-aligned latent identity map and a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net to predict Gaussian attributes, enabling efficient adaptation.

Result: PGHM reduces optimization time to ~20 minutes per subject while maintaining visual quality, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: PGHM offers a practical solution for monocular avatar creation, balancing efficiency and rendering quality.

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

### [15] [Flood-DamageSense: Multimodal Mamba with Multitask Learning for Building Flood Damage Assessment using SAR Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06667)
*Yu-Hsuan Ho,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flood-DamageSense is a deep-learning model for flood-damage assessment, outperforming existing methods by 19% F1 score, especially in minor/moderate damage cases, using multimodal data and risk-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to accurately identify flood-related building damages due to unclear spectral or structural signatures post-inundation.

Method: The model fuses SAR/InSAR, optical basemaps, and flood-risk layers, using a multimodal Mamba backbone with semi-Siamese encoders and task-specific decoders.

Result: Achieves a 19% F1 improvement over baselines, with significant gains in minor/moderate damage classification, validated on Hurricane Harvey data.

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense provides faster, finer-grained flood-damage intelligence, enhancing post-disaster decision-making.

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

TL;DR: An XAI framework combining CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM) is proposed to classify embryos from blastocyst images, improving efficiency and accuracy in IVF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infertility's growing impact and the inefficiency of manual embryo grading in IVF motivate the need for an automated, accurate, and interpretable solution.

Method: The study employs a CNN-LSTM deep learning model to classify embryos using blastocyst images, enhanced by XAI for interpretability.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while providing explainable insights.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM framework offers a promising, efficient, and interpretable solution for embryo selection in IVF.

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance detail preservation and scene analysis in VR/AR applications by reconstructing high-resolution omnidirectional content from low-resolution inputs.

Method: Review of deep learning-based approaches, introduction of the 360Insta dataset with real-world distortions, and comprehensive evaluation of existing methods.

Result: The 360Insta dataset addresses gaps in current benchmarks, enabling better generalization evaluation. Public availability of datasets and methods.

Conclusion: The paper provides a thorough review, introduces a valuable dataset, and outlines future research directions in ODISR/ODVSR.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation

*Saiyu Hu,Chunlei He,Jianfeng Zhang,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (HMCF-ACMs) and their dual-mode variant (HDRF-ACMs) for adaptive image segmentation, proving their equivalence to wave equations and demonstrating improved precision and noise resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parabolic mean curvature flow-driven models (PMCF-ACMs) heavily depend on initial curve configurations, limiting adaptability. The paper aims to overcome this by introducing tunable initial velocity fields in HMCF-ACMs.

Method: Proposes HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs, establishes their equivalence to wave equations using level set methods, and optimizes a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for solving these equations.

Result: Experiments show HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs achieve more precise segmentation with better noise resistance and numerical stability.

Conclusion: The proposed models offer adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios, outperforming traditional PMCF-ACMs.

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

*Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Jiahao Huo,Fredrik Gustafsson,Terence L. van Zyl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for wildlife, focusing on the Big Five African animals, to improve human-wildlife conflict mitigation. It compares parametric and non-parametric methods, showing feature-based approaches generalize better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current animal classification models are overconfident with unknown classes, limiting their effectiveness in diverse environments. This study aims to improve OOD detection for wildlife.

Method: The study uses parametric (Nearest Class Mean) and non-parametric (contrastive learning) baselines, leveraging pretrained features from classification encoders. It compares these to common OOD methods.

Result: Feature-based methods, especially NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features, outperform others, showing 2%, 4%, and 22% improvements in AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT, and AUTC metrics.

Conclusion: Feature-based OOD detection methods, like NCM, enhance generalization for wildlife classification, offering a promising solution for human-wildlife conflict mitigation.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

*Zixian Gao,Chao Yang,Zhanhui Zhou,Xing Xu,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Local Perception Search (LPS) is a training-free decoding method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by leveraging local visual priors, especially effective in noisy scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs exhibit hallucination issues where outputs don't align with image content, despite their success in vision-language tasks.

Method: Introduces LPS, a simple, plug-and-play decoding method using local visual priors to correct hallucinations during inference.

Result: LPS significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming baselines, with notable effectiveness in noisy image conditions.

Conclusion: LPS is a practical, model-agnostic solution to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, particularly under noisy data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task of SAR target structure recovery, aiming to infer target components and their structural relationships from single-view SAR images using a two-step framework based on structural descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR image methods focus on 3D reconstruction or local features, missing semantic structural modeling. The goal is to derive semantic representations directly from 2D SAR images.

Method: A two-step framework: (1) detect 2D keypoints from real SAR images, (2) learn mapping to 3D hierarchical structures using simulated data. Integrated in testing for 3D structure inference.

Result: Validated effectiveness, showing 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be derived from single-view SAR images.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully infers 3D semantic structures from SAR images, addressing a gap in SAR image interpretation.

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of unified, resource-efficient anti-spoofing across multiple biometric modalities.

Method: Uses Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss to enhance inter-class separability and cross-modal consistency.

Result: Achieves 1.36% lower average EER than state-of-the-art methods across seven datasets with only 6M parameters.

Conclusion: LitMAS is efficient, generalizable, and suitable for edge deployment, with code and models available.

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method using Neural Controlled Differential Equations and Savitzky-Golay paths to model rotational dynamics on SO(3), outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SO(3) extrapolation due to noisy/sparse observations, complex dynamics, and long-term forecasting needs.

Method: Uses Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by Savitzky-Golay paths to learn latent dynamics while respecting SO(3) geometry.

Result: Demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities on real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses SO(3) extrapolation challenges by leveraging continuous-time modeling and geometric structure.

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term
forecasting. This work proposes modeling continuous-time rotational object
dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

*Mohammad Ali Rezaei,Helia Hajikazem,Saeed Khanehgir,Mahdi Javanmardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized image synthesis using diffusion models, improving identity retention and content detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing style transfer techniques struggle with identity preservation, especially for small or distant faces.

Method: Introduces "Mosaic Restored Content Image" and a training-free content consistency loss to enhance identity and detail retention.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in maintaining stylistic fidelity and identity integrity without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses identity preservation challenges in style transfer for diffusion models.

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RDVP-MSD is a training-free framework for Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) that combines Region-constrained Dual-stream Visual Prompting (RDVP) and Multimodal Stepwise Decomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT) to address semantic ambiguity and discrepancy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current promptable segmentation methods for COS face issues like semantic ambiguity in text prompts and semantic discrepancy in visual prompts, leading to poor segmentation accuracy.

Method: RDVP-MSD integrates RDVP for spatial constraints in visual prompting and MSD-CoT for progressive caption disentanglement, eliminating ambiguity and discrepancy without training.

Result: RDVP-MSD achieves top performance on COS benchmarks with faster inference speed, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses COS challenges, offering a training-free, high-performance solution with open-source availability.

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-LSplat proposes a view-consistent hierarchical language Gaussian Splatting method for 3D open-vocabulary querying, addressing inconsistencies in 2D-based models and improving hierarchical semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent 3DGS-based models lack unified 3D representations and suffer from view inconsistencies and open-vocabulary challenges, hindering hierarchical semantic understanding.

Method: Hi-LSplat lifts 2D features to 3D using a hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering and employs instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses for robust semantic representation.

Result: The method excels in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization, demonstrating strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets.

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat effectively addresses view inconsistencies and enhances hierarchical semantic understanding in 3D scenes.

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D

### [30] [Exploring Visual Prompting: Robustness Inheritance and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06823)
*Qi Li,Liangzhi Li,Zhouqiang Jiang,Bowen Wang,Keke Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Visual Prompting (VP) with robust source models, confirming robustness inheritance and a trade-off with generalization. It introduces Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL) to mitigate this trade-off, enhancing VP's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if VP inherits robustness from robust source models and address the robustness-generalization trade-off.

Method: Proposes Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL), a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy compatible with VP.

Result: PBL successfully inherits robustness and improves generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: The findings are universal, and PBL effectively enhances VP's performance with robust source models.

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

*Chenfei Yuan,Nanshan Jia,Hangqi Li,Peter W. Glynn,Zeyu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for coupled image generation with shared backgrounds and flexible foreground objects, using disentangled attention modules and time-varying weight control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable multiple generated images to share similar backgrounds while allowing foreground objects to vary based on different text prompts.

Method: Disentangles background and entity components in cross-attention modules, using time-varying weight control parameters optimized for coupling, alignment, and quality.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in background coupling, text-to-image alignment, and visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances shared backgrounds with flexible foreground generation, improving over prior approaches.

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoARSS is a multi-task learning framework for endoscopic surgery, combining activity recognition and semantic segmentation, leveraging DINOv2 and novel adapters for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in surgical scene understanding due to high variability and image feature confusion, traditional models struggle with cross-activity interference.

Method: Proposes EndoARSS, integrating Low-Rank Adaptation and Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters with Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention for enhanced feature discrimination.

Result: Outperforms existing models in accuracy and robustness, validated on three new datasets (MTLESD, MTLEndovis, MTLEndovis-Gen).

Conclusion: EndoARSS advances AI-driven endoscopic surgery, improving surgical safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

### [33] [Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06836)
*Zelin He,Sarah Alnegheimish,Matthew Reimherr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage VLM-based method (ViT4TS and VLM4TS) for time-series anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods lack visual-temporal reasoning like human experts. VLMs show promise but underperform in direct TSAD applications.

Method: Two-stage approach: ViT4TS for anomaly localization using 2-D representations, and VLM4TS for refining detection with global context.

Result: VLM4TS outperforms baselines by 24.6% in F1-max score and is 36x more efficient in token usage.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages VLMs for TSAD, improving accuracy and efficiency without time-series training.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

*Yangkai Lin,Jiabao Lei,Kui jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method, Multi-StyleGS, is introduced to stylize 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using multiple reference styles while maintaining memory efficiency and enhancing multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for stylizing 3D scenes to match artistic styles of reference images has grown, but existing methods struggle with memory efficiency and local style transfer.

Method: The approach uses bipartite matching for style-image correspondence, a semantic style loss function for local transfer, and regularization techniques for robust semantic labeling.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques in stylization quality, memory efficiency, and editing flexibility.

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS effectively addresses the challenges of 3D GS stylization, offering improved results and practical usability.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

*Sara M. Cerqueira,Manuel Palermo,Cristina P. Santos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Neural Networks to simplify human pose estimation with inertial sensors, comparing architectures and achieving results close to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the complexity and cost of traditional biomechanical models for pose estimation by leveraging Neural Networks.

Method: Comparison of Neural Network architectures and methodologies, including Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick, using low-cost and high-end MARG sensors.

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick achieved a Quaternion Angle distance error of 7.96 with high-end sensors, comparable to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Neural Networks can effectively estimate human pose, matching traditional methods, with potential for cost-efficient solutions.

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

*John Waithaka,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LOCA, a position prediction self-supervised learning method for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation, outperforming reconstruction-based methods like MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labelled training data for satellite imagery semantic segmentation and the focus of existing methods (e.g., MAE) on reconstruction rather than localization.

Method: Adapts LOCA for multimodal satellite data, extends SatMAE's channel grouping, introduces same-group attention masking, and uses relative patch position prediction.

Result: Outperforms reconstruction-based methods on the Sen1Floods11 dataset, showing better representations for segmentation.

Conclusion: Position prediction tasks, adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, are more effective for semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

*Markus Knoche,Daan de Geus,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DONUT, a decoder-only model for trajectory prediction, outperforms encoder-decoder baselines by using autoregressive predictions and an 'overprediction' strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving motion prediction for autonomous driving by leveraging decoder-only models, inspired by language modeling success.

Method: Uses a single autoregressive model to encode history and predict future trajectories iteratively, with an 'overprediction' strategy for longer horizons.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 2 benchmark.

Conclusion: Decoder-only models like DONUT enhance trajectory forecasting by ensuring consistent, up-to-date predictions and better future anticipation.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

*Chaoyang Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-EKIPL introduces external high-quality actions to guide RL training, improving MLLMs' reasoning performance by 5% over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for MLLMs limit reasoning capability and training efficiency by relying solely on policy model actions.

Method: Proposes Vision-EKIPL, an RL framework integrating external auxiliary models to infuse high-quality actions during training.

Result: Achieves 5% performance improvement on Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark compared to SOTA.

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL overcomes traditional RL limitations, enhancing visual reasoning and offering a new research paradigm.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

TL;DR: An end-to-end 3D face recognition method integrates denoising and recognition, using cGAN-TOP for noise removal and LDGCNN for recognition, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw 3D point clouds often contain noise from imperfect sensors, hindering accurate face recognition.

Method: Combines cGAN-TOP for denoising and LDGCNN for hierarchical feature extraction and recognition.

Result: Validated on Bosphorus dataset, the method improves recognition accuracy by up to 14.81% under various noise settings.

Conclusion: The synergistic integration of denoising and recognition modules effectively enhances 3D face recognition performance.

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Conclusion: The model offers scalable, interpretable ASD screening, beneficial for resource-limited or remote settings.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early
intervention. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework combining
Vision Transformers (ViT) and Vision Mamba to detect ASD using eye-tracking
data. The model uses attention-based fusion to integrate visual, speech, and
facial cues, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Unlike traditional
handcrafted methods, it applies state-of-the-art deep learning and explainable
AI techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and transparency. Tested on the
Saliency4ASD dataset, the proposed ViT-Mamba model outperformed existing
methods, achieving 0.96 accuracy, 0.95 F1-score, 0.97 sensitivity, and 0.94

TL;DR: NSD-Imagery is a benchmark dataset for mental image reconstruction from fMRI, complementing NSD. It evaluates model generalization from seen to mental images, showing architectural choices impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating fMRI-to-image models on mental imagery, critical for medical and brain-computer interface applications.

Method: Benchmarking recent NSD-trained models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, etc.) on NSD-Imagery to assess generalization from seen to mental images.

Result: Performance on mental images is decoupled from seen images; simpler linear and multimodal architectures generalize better, while complex ones overfit.

Conclusion: Mental imagery datasets like NSD-Imagery are essential for practical applications, guiding better model alignment with real-world needs.

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KNN-Defense is a lightweight, efficient method to defend 3D point cloud classifiers against adversarial attacks by leveraging semantic similarity of neighboring training samples. It shows significant robustness improvements, especially under point-dropping attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud analysis are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (e.g., point dropping, shifting, adding), compromising system reliability. Existing defenses often fail, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: KNN-Defense uses the manifold assumption and nearest-neighbor search in feature space to restore perturbed inputs, focusing on semantic similarity rather than geometry reconstruction or uniform point distributions.

Result: On ModelNet40, KNN-Defense improved accuracy under point-dropping attacks by 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% for PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively.

Conclusion: KNN-Defense is scalable, effective, and suitable for real-time applications, offering a practical solution to enhance adversarial resilience in 3D point cloud classifiers.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaME, a dynamic scene adaptation system for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing long-term scene evolution and maintaining consistency with a novel keyframe management mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems excel in static scenes but struggle with long-term dynamics (scene changes out of view) and maintaining consistency due to stale observations.

Method: Proposes a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism for continuous updates and a keyframe management system to discard outdated observations while preserving information.

Result: GaME outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GaME effectively addresses long-term dynamics and consistency challenges in evolving scenes, offering improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel sleep stage classification method using multimodal EOG and PSM data with ImageBind, outperforming existing models and showing adaptability with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PSG is complex and unsuitable for home-based monitoring, prompting the need for less obtrusive alternatives like EOG and PSM.

Method: Leverages ImageBind to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage classification, fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy.

Result: Fine-tuned ImageBind outperforms single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet), PSM-only (ViViT), and other multimodal approaches (MBT), achieving strong performance even without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Pre-trained multimodal models like ImageBind can be effectively adapted for sleep staging, offering accuracy close to EEG-based systems with simpler data.

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Result: Achieves text reading in low light with 2400x less bandwidth than RGB cameras, outperforming traditional OCR.

Conclusion: Event-based OCR with eye gaze and LLMs is a promising solution for smart glasses in challenging environments.

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

### [46] [How Important are Videos for Training Video LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06928)
*George Lydakis,Alexander Hermans,Ali Athar,Daan de Geus,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video LLMs trained on images alone show strong temporal reasoning, with video-specific training offering minimal gains. A simple image-sequence finetuning method matches or exceeds video-trained performance, suggesting underutilized temporal features in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the temporal reasoning capabilities of Video LLMs and assess the effectiveness of video-specific training compared to image-only training.

Method: Initialized pretrained text-only LLMs, finetuned on image- and video-caption datasets. Evaluated performance on TVBench and introduced a simple finetuning scheme with annotated image sequences.

Result: Image-trained LLMs performed significantly above chance on temporal reasoning tasks, with minimal improvement from video training. The proposed finetuning method matched or outperformed video-trained models.

Conclusion: Current Video LLMs underutilize temporal features in videos, highlighting the need for research into mechanisms enabling image-trained temporal reasoning and inefficiencies in video training schemes.

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

*Mellon M. Zhang,Glen Chou,Saibal Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHiM introduces a novel SSM architecture for polar-coordinate streaming LiDAR, outperforming prior methods by 10% and matching full-scan baselines at higher throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and misalignment of conventional methods in processing LiDAR data for autonomous vehicles, which rely on translation-invariant convolutions or memory-intensive full-scan approaches.

Method: PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling, replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware operations.

Result: PHiM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming previous methods by 10% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput.

Conclusion: PHiM demonstrates the effectiveness of SSMs for streaming LiDAR perception, offering a distortion-aware and efficient alternative to conventional methods.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

*Ying Shen,Zhiyang Xu,Jiuhai Chen,Shizhe Diao,Jiaxin Zhang,Yuguang Yao,Joy Rimchala,Ismini Lourentzou,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTtE-Flow is a novel architecture unifying image understanding and generation efficiently, leveraging pretrained VLMs and a flow-based design for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified models require extensive pretraining, underperform task-specific models, and have slow image generation, limiting practical use.

Method: LaTtE-Flow uses a Layerwise Timestep-Expert flow-based Transformer, distributing flow-matching across specialized layer groups and employing Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention.

Result: LaTtE-Flow achieves strong multimodal understanding and competitive image generation with 6x faster inference.

Conclusion: LaTtE-Flow efficiently unifies image tasks, addressing speed and performance gaps in existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

*Maciej Zyrek,Tomasz Tarasiewicz,Jakub Sadel,Aleksandra Krzywon,Michal Kawulok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task learning framework for single-image super-resolution is proposed, optimized for OCR tasks by incorporating auxiliary loss functions from high-level vision tasks, improving text detection while preserving image fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent deep learning-based super-resolution methods struggle with real-world settings like document scans due to complex degradations and semantic variability.

Method: A task-driven, multi-task learning framework with auxiliary loss functions (text detection, recognition, keypoints localization, hue consistency) and dynamic weight averaging is introduced, validated on SRResNet.

Result: The approach improves text detection (measured with IoU) and maintains image fidelity on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models bridges the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

### [50] [AR-RAG: Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06962)
*Jingyuan Qi,Zhiyang Xu,Qifan Wang,Lifu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-RAG improves image generation by dynamically retrieving and incorporating patch-level references during generation, avoiding issues like over-copying. Two frameworks, DAiD and FAiD, are proposed to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on static retrievals, leading to limitations like over-copying and stylistic bias. AR-RAG aims to address these by enabling context-aware retrievals at each generation step.

Method: AR-RAG uses two frameworks: DAiD (training-free decoding strategy) and FAiD (parameter-efficient fine-tuning method). Both dynamically integrate retrieved patches into the generation process.

Result: AR-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like Midjourney-30K, GenEval, and DPG-Bench.

Conclusion: AR-RAG introduces a dynamic retrieval approach for image generation, significantly improving performance and addressing limitations of static retrieval methods.

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

### [51] [Dual-view Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion with CNN-Transformer Hybrid Network for Chinese Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06966)
*Siyuan Jing,Guangxue Wang,Haoyang Zhai,Qin Tao,Jun Yang,Bing Wang,Peng Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-view sign language dataset (NationalCSL-DP) for ISLR, addressing gaps in existing datasets, and proposes a CNN transformer network with a simple fusion strategy to improve recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sign language datasets lack full vocabulary coverage and single-view RGB videos struggle with hand occlusions, limiting real-world ISLR applications.

Method: A dual-view dataset (NationalCSL-DP) is created, covering Chinese sign language vocabulary, and a CNN transformer network with a fusion strategy is proposed.

Result: The fusion strategy boosts ISLR performance, but sequence-to-sequence models struggle to learn complementary features from dual-view videos.

Conclusion: The dataset and baseline method enhance ISLR, though challenges remain in feature fusion for dual-view learning.

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

*Pengfei Zhao,Rongbo Luan,Wei Zhang,Peng Wu,Sifeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPLE introduces a reinforcement learning framework using MLLMs to improve fine-grained cross-modal retrieval by leveraging modality alignment priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in CLIP's feature space and the coarse alignment in MLLM-based retrievers limit cross-modal retrieval performance.

Method: MAPLE uses MLLMs for automatic preference data construction and a Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss to guide embedding learning.

Result: MAPLE achieves significant improvements in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval.

Conclusion: MAPLE effectively bridges the modality gap by leveraging MLLMs' alignment properties for nuanced semantic distinctions.

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and textured meshes improves rendering efficiency for indoor scenes by reducing Gaussian primitives while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex textures in 3DGS require excessive Gaussians, slowing rendering. A hybrid approach addresses this inefficiency.

Method: Uses textured meshes for flat areas and Gaussians for complex geometries, with joint optimization and transmittance-aware supervision.

Result: Achieves comparable rendering quality with higher FPS and fewer Gaussians.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation balances efficiency and quality for indoor scene rendering.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

*Yanting Gao,Yepeng Liu,Junming Liu,Qi Zhang,Hongyun Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes COGO, a strategy to enhance adversarial example transferability in ViTs by focusing on shared features and suppressing model-specific traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ViTs' adversarial vulnerabilities and improving transferability of adversarial examples in black-box settings.

Method: COGO includes Commonality Enhancement (CE) for mid-to-low frequency perturbations and Individuality Suppression (IS) for gradient weighting.

Result: COGO significantly boosts transfer success rates, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: COGO effectively improves adversarial transferability by leveraging shared features and suppressing individuality in surrogate models.

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Enhancing wide-angle images using telephoto references in smartphone photography, addressing domain gaps and high-frequency detail transfer.

Method: Uses Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching to bridge domain gaps and improve detail transfer, with Key Pruning for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DM$^3$Net effectively enhances image resolution while optimizing memory and speed.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as
a reference. In this paper, we propose DM$^3$Net, a novel dual-camera
super-resolution network based on Domain Modulation and Multi-scale Matching.
To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BePo combines BEV and sparse points representations for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, addressing limitations of both methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction are either computationally expensive (dense 3D feature volume) or suffer from limitations (BEV loses small object details, sparse points struggle with large surfaces).

Method: Proposes a dual-branch design: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch, with cross-attention to share 3D information. Outputs are fused for final prediction.

Result: Superior performance on Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks, with competitive inference speed.

Conclusion: BePo effectively balances accuracy and efficiency for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI, EuRoC-MAV, and TUM-RGBD benchmarks.

Conclusion: UNO offers a robust, adaptable solution for monocular visual odometry, outperforming traditional methods in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,
platforms, and motion patterns. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including
autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To
this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class
of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable
Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for video QA are limited to single clips, failing to address real-world challenges of large-scale audio-visual retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Proposes AVHaystacks benchmark with 3100 QA pairs and MAGNET, a multi-agent framework, for multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding.

Result: MAGNET achieves 89% and 65% relative improvements in BLEU@4 and GPT scores, with new metrics STEM and MTGS introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: The work advances LMM capabilities in complex audio-visual reasoning and provides tools for robust evaluation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

### [61] [Interpretable and Reliable Detection of AI-Generated Images via Grounded Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07045)
*Yikun Ji,Hong Yan,Jun Lan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Qi Fan,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve AI-generated image detection using fine-tuned Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing issues like hallucination and misalignment with human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods lack interpretability and robustness, while MLLMs, though capable, struggle with hallucination and alignment with human reasoning.

Method: A dataset of AI-generated images with bounding boxes and captions is created. MLLMs are fine-tuned via multi-stage optimization for detection, localization, and explanation.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms baselines in detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws.

Conclusion: The approach enhances interpretability and accuracy in AI-generated image detection, bridging the gap between MLLMs and human reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

*Zheng Wang,Kai Ying,Bin Xu,Chunjiao Wang,Cong Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRE-Net, a two-stage pipeline for accurate infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrieval, outperforming existing methods like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrared-based precipitation retrieval methods are inaccurate, while more accurate microwave and radar methods have limited coverage. The PRE task aims to improve infrared-based retrievals beyond the scanning swath.

Method: PRE-Net uses a two-stage pipeline: Swath-Distilling (knowledge transfer via CoMWE) and Full-Disc Adaptation (refinement via Self-MaskTune).

Result: PRE-Net significantly outperforms leading products in precipitation retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances infrared-based precipitation retrieval, offering a promising solution for broader coverage and accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

TL;DR: LSSKD is a self-supervised knowledge distillation framework that improves model performance without large teacher networks, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To train compact models without relying on over-parameterized teacher networks, enabling efficient deployment on low-computing devices.

Method: Uses auxiliary classifiers on intermediate feature maps for one-to-one knowledge transfer across network stages.

Result: Achieves 4.54% improvement over PS-KD, 1.14% over SSKD on CIFAR-100, and 0.32% over HASSKD on ImageNet.

Conclusion: LSSKD enhances model generalization and performance efficiently, suitable for low-resource and multimodal environments.

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes D2R Loss and CAG for adversarial training to enhance DNN robustness by addressing insufficient loss guidance and non-collaborative adversarial generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack effective loss guidance and collaborative adversarial generation, limiting model robustness against attacks.

Method: Introduces D2R Loss (dual regularization) for distribution optimization and CAG (collaborative adversarial generation) for gradient-based sample creation.

Result: Tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet with WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18, showing high robustness.

Conclusion: D2R Loss with CAG effectively improves model robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volume and heterogeneity of Earth Observation data require innovative strategies for processing and annotation.

Method: IGN introduces FLAIR-HUB, combining six aligned modalities (aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2, SPOT, topographic data, historical images) and evaluates multimodal fusion and deep learning models.

Result: Best land cover performance: 78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU, using nearly all modalities.

Conclusion: FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal pretraining, providing a valuable resource for land cover and crop mapping.

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal

### [66] [UCOD-DPL: Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07087)
*Weiqi Yan,Lvhai Chen,Huaijia Kou,Shengchuan Zhang,Yan Zhang,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UCOD-DPL, an unsupervised camouflaged object detection method using dynamic pseudo-label learning, adaptive modules, and adversarial decoding to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCOD methods suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and simple decoders, leading to poor performance. The paper aims to address these issues by introducing adaptive and adversarial techniques.

Method: The proposed UCOD-DPL includes an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial (DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism to refine pseudo-labels and enhance feature learning.

Result: The method outperforms existing UCOD approaches and even some fully supervised methods, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL effectively addresses the limitations of current UCOD methods, offering a robust solution for unsupervised camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

*Yangkai Lin,Jiabao Lei,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneLCM is an end-to-end framework combining LLM for layout design and LCM for scene optimization, addressing challenges in automated indoor scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for indoor scene synthesis face issues like rigid editing, physical incoherence, high human effort, single-room limits, and poor material quality. SceneLCM aims to overcome these.

Method: SceneLCM decomposes scene generation into four pipelines: LLM-guided layout generation, furniture generation using CTS, environment optimization with multiresolution texture fields, and physical editing via simulation.

Result: SceneLCM outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating complex, interactive indoor scenes.

Conclusion: SceneLCM offers a modular, efficient solution for high-quality indoor scene synthesis with broad application potential.

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes EdgeSpotter, a multi-scale dense text spotter for industrial panels, addressing challenges like cross-scale localization and dense text regions. It introduces a Transformer with an efficient mixer and a new feature sampling method, validated on a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial panels is challenging due to issues like cross-scale localization and dense text regions. Existing methods lack multi-scale feature exploration.

Method: Proposes EdgeSpotter with a Transformer-based mixer for multi-level feature interdependencies and a new feature sampling method using catmull-rom splines to encode text shape, position, and semantics.

Result: Superior performance validated on the new IPM benchmark dataset, with practical tests confirming the method's effectiveness in industrial panel monitoring.

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter offers accurate and robust text spotting for industrial panels, with practical applicability demonstrated through an edge AI-based vision system.

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available

TL;DR: Hi-VAE is a video autoencoding framework that hierarchically models motion for efficient compression and high-fidelity reconstruction, achieving a 1428× compression factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video autoencoders inefficiently model spatio-temporal redundancies, leading to high training costs and suboptimal compression.

Method: Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into Global Motion and Detailed Motion, using self-supervised encoders and a conditional diffusion decoder for reconstruction.

Result: Hi-VAE achieves a 1428× compression factor, 30× higher than baselines, with high reconstruction quality and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Hi-VAE offers efficient, scalable, and interpretable video latent representation, opening new avenues for video generation research.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatial Token Fusion (STF) and Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) to reduce vision token sequences in large multimodal models (LMMs), improving efficiency without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiency in LMMs due to high LLM costs and quadratic complexity of long vision token sequences.

Method: Introduces STF to fuse spatial-adjacent tokens and MBTF to add multi-granularity features, balancing token reduction and information preservation.

Result: Achieves comparable/superior performance on 8 benchmarks with only 25% vision tokens.

Conclusion: STF and MBTF enhance inference efficiency while maintaining multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoTrack is a CAD-based method for 6DoF object pose refinement and tracking, integrating model-to-frame and frame-to-frame registration via optical flow, achieving state-of-the-art results without object-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods rely on analysis-by-synthesis for model-to-frame registration, lacking efficiency and stability. GoTrack addresses this by combining both model-to-frame and frame-to-frame registration.

Method: GoTrack uses optical flow for both registrations: a transformer on DINOv2 for model-to-frame, and a lightweight off-the-shelf model for frame-to-frame.

Result: GoTrack achieves state-of-the-art RGB-only results on 6DoF object pose benchmarks when combined with coarse pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: GoTrack provides an efficient, accurate, and minimal pipeline for 6DoF object pose tracking, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods to speed up Oriented FAST feature detection in SLAM systems for real-time performance on low-end GPUs, achieving a 7.3x speedup over OpenCV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ORB-based SLAM systems struggle with real-time processing on mobile platforms due to slow Oriented FAST calculations.

Method: Binary-level encoding for FAST feature detection and separable Harris detection with GPU-specific optimizations.

Result: 7.3x speedup on Jetson TX2 compared to OpenCV with GPU support.

Conclusion: The methods enable real-time SLAM on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: Existing methods rely on fine-tuning large models, which is impractical as model sizes grow. Frame Guidance addresses this by offering a training-free solution.

Method: Proposes Frame Guidance with latent processing for memory efficiency and latent optimization for coherent video generation.

Result: Produces high-quality controlled videos for tasks like keyframe guidance, stylization, and looping without training.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance is a versatile, efficient solution for controllable video generation, compatible with any video model.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Conclusion: The method offers a novel, efficient training paradigm with interpretable insights, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

### [76] [SAP-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Surgical Action Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07196)
*Mengya Xu,Zhongzhen Huang,Dillan Imans,Yiru Ye,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAP-Bench is introduced as a dataset for evaluating MLLMs in surgical action planning, revealing gaps in current models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate the precise and verifiable capabilities needed for surgical action planning, a life-critical task.

Method: SAP-Bench, a dataset with 1,226 clinically validated action clips, is created. The MLLM-SAP framework leverages MLLMs for next-action recommendations.

Result: Evaluation of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs shows critical gaps in next-action prediction performance.

Conclusion: SAP-Bench addresses the need for better evaluation tools in surgical action planning, highlighting areas for MLLM improvement.

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

*Min-Jung Kim,Dongjin Kim,Seokju Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-LiVE is a training-free, text-guided video editing framework that enables complex tasks like object addition and non-rigid transformations by exploiting vital layers in video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for more accessible and controllable video editing, especially for complex tasks like adding novel objects and non-rigid transformations, which are underexplored.

Method: TV-LiVE identifies vital layers in video generation models (linked to RoPE) and selectively injects key/value features for editing. For object addition, it extracts masks from prominent layers to guide edits.

Result: TV-LiVE outperforms existing methods in object addition and non-rigid video editing, with extracted masks accurately indicating edit regions.

Conclusion: TV-LiVE provides an effective, training-free solution for complex video editing tasks, advancing the field beyond simpler edits like style transfer.

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

### [78] [Backdoor Attack on Vision Language Models with Stealthy Semantic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07214)
*Zhiyuan Zhong,Zhen Sun,Yepang Liu,Xinlei He,Guanhong Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadSem introduces a backdoor attack exploiting cross-modal semantic mismatches in VLMs, achieving high success rates and evading defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior attacks focus on single-modality triggers, leaving cross-modal vulnerabilities unexplored.

Method: BadSem poisons training data by misaligning image-text pairs, using the SIMBad dataset for semantic manipulation.

Result: Achieves over 98% ASR, generalizes well, and transfers across modalities. Defenses tested fail.

Conclusion: Semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs need urgent attention for safer deployment.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data augmentation framework for skeleton-based datasets, integrating geometric and intensity-based transformations to enhance diversity and robustness in gesture recognition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited dataset diversity and challenges like viewpoint bias and occlusions in skeleton-based datasets, improving model generalization.

Method: Proposes a pipeline combining random cropping, rotation, zooming, brightness, and contrast adjustments, generating three augmented versions per sample.

Result: Evaluated on e2eET, FPPR, and DD-Net models, the framework improves performance on DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The augmentation strategy significantly enhances model robustness and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world HGR and action recognition.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

*Tianyi Bai,Yuxuan Fan,Jiantao Qiu,Fupeng Sun,Jiayi Song,Junlin Han,Zichen Liu,Conghui He,Wentao Zhang,Binhang Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a controlled data generation pipeline and a supervised fine-tuning framework to improve fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reducing hallucinations and missed semantic shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts, due to limitations in training data and learning objectives.

Method: A controlled data generation pipeline creates minimally edited image pairs with aligned captions (Micro Edit Dataset, MED). A supervised fine-tuning framework with a feature-level consistency loss is introduced.

Result: The method improves difference detection accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and shows gains on standard vision-language tasks like image captioning and VQA.

Conclusion: Targeted data and alignment objectives effectively enhance fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic inference framework for MLLMs, enabling iterative, verifier-guided visual reasoning, outperforming static methods in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use static visual token encoding, limiting adaptability. The work aims to mimic human-like dynamic perception for better reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process with a reasoner and verifier, trained via DPO, and introduces the VTS dataset for supervised and preference-based learning.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in visual reasoning benchmarks, offering improved accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: Dynamic inference mechanisms show promise for enhancing context-aware visual reasoning in future MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

*Chen Jiang,Hong Liu,Xuzheng Yu,Qing Wang,Yuan Cheng,Jia Xu,Zhongyi Liu,Qingpei Guo,Wei Chu,Ming Yang,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves text-video retrieval by enhancing contrastive learning with techniques to handle hard negative pairs and model fine-grained semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for text-video retrieval overlook hard negative pairs and lack fine-grained semantic modeling.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module (DMAE) to mine hard negatives and a Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module for fine-grained similarity. Introduces a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four datasets: MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively address the limitations of current methods, improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval
increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and
search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than
irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal
similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods
have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on
the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video
representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard
negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic
similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive
learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust
discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module
(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further
introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively
identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the
training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model
fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby
present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to
construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating
fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL
designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to
model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video
retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) are repurposed for diverse tasks using few-shot fine-tuning, demonstrating their adaptability beyond video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the internal knowledge and adaptability of VDMs beyond their generative capabilities.

Method: A few-shot fine-tuning framework transforms tasks into visual transitions, training LoRA weights on short sequences without modifying the frozen VDM.

Result: The model generalizes well across tasks, from low-level vision to high-level reasoning.

Conclusion: VDMs are adaptable visual learners, potentially serving as backbone for future vision foundation models.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

Motivation: To explore the capabilities of VLMs in handling complex tasks like reverse designing, which involves understanding interactions between images, edited versions, and optional text.

Method: The authors fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for reverse designing, leveraging its ability to process image and text modalities simultaneously.

Result: Experiments show MiniGPT-4's extensibility for reverse designing, proving its effectiveness in complex vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of off-the-shelf VLMs like MiniGPT-4 for advanced multi-modal applications, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements
through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process
image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to
learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various
multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex
vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a
source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit
description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the
source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context
simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper,
we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our
experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically
MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multistep optimization strategy for diffusion models to enhance image restoration fidelity, robustness, and generalization, outperforming single-step approaches like MPGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MPGD limit restoration quality by applying only one gradient update per denoising step, especially in challenging settings.

Method: A multistep optimization strategy is implemented within each denoising timestep to improve image quality and perceptual accuracy.

Result: Experiments show improved LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead, validated on degraded ImageNet and UAV datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced MPGD is a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FANVID is a new video benchmark for low-resolution face and license plate recognition, featuring 1,463 clips with 63 identities and 49 plates. It includes two tasks: face matching and plate recognition, with baseline scores of 0.58 and 0.42, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recognizing faces and license plates in low-resolution surveillance videos by leveraging temporal information.

Method: The dataset includes downsampled videos with manually verified labels. Tasks involve face matching to mugshots and plate text extraction. Baseline uses super-resolution, detection, and recognition models.

Result: Baseline performance: 0.58 for face matching and 0.42 for plate recognition.

Conclusion: FANVID supports innovation in temporal modeling for low-resolution recognition, with applications in surveillance and forensics.

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

TL;DR: AllTracker is a model for long-range point tracking in videos, offering high-resolution, dense correspondence fields between frames, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking and optical flow methods are limited in resolution, density, or temporal range, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The model blends optical flow and point tracking techniques, using iterative inference on low-resolution grids, spatial propagation via 2D convolutions, and temporal propagation via pixel-aligned attention layers.

Result: AllTracker achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at high resolution (768x1024 pixels) with 16 million parameters, trained on diverse datasets for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The model's design and training approach are validated through ablation studies, and its code and weights are publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

TL;DR: STARFlow is a scalable generative model using normalizing flows and Transformers for high-resolution image synthesis, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling normalizing flows for high-resolution image synthesis while maintaining exact maximum likelihood training.

Method: Combines Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow) with innovations like deep-shallow design, latent space modeling, and a novel guidance algorithm.

Result: Achieves strong performance in class-conditional and text-conditional image generation, rivaling diffusion models.

Conclusion: STARFlow is the first successful large-scale normalizing flow model, demonstrating effectiveness at high resolutions.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

TL;DR: A diagnostic test reveals many saliency methods fail to distinguish between class labels, prompting the introduction of CASE, a contrastive method for more reliable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of saliency methods in distinguishing class labels, despite their visual plausibility.

Method: Proposes a diagnostic test for class sensitivity and introduces CASE, a contrastive explanation method.

Result: Many saliency methods produce class-insensitive explanations; CASE outperforms them in fidelity and class specificity.

Conclusion: CASE provides more faithful and class-specific explanations, addressing a structural limitation in existing saliency methods.

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

### [90] [Hierarchical Scoring with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Instance Image-Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07338)
*Yijie Deng,Shuaihang Yuan,Geeta Chandra Raju Bethala,Anthony Tzes,Yu-Shen Liu,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) introduces hierarchical scoring to optimize viewpoint selection, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IIN methods rely on random viewpoint sampling, leading to inefficiency due to overlapping images and lack of principled view selection.

Method: The framework combines cross-level semantic scoring (using CLIP-derived relevancy fields) and fine-grained local geometric scoring for precise pose estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and demonstrates real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The hierarchical scoring paradigm significantly improves efficiency and accuracy in IIN tasks.

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

*Satvik Praveen,Yoonsung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO enhances object detection in agriculture by combining TPS for non-rigid transformations and CBAM for noise suppression, outperforming STN-YOLO on occluded datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of YOLO and STNs in handling occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise in precision agriculture.

Method: Integrates Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) into STNs for flexible transformations and uses CBAM for attention-guided feature refinement.

Result: Achieves higher precision, recall, and mAP on the PGP dataset with a 12% reduction in false positives.

Conclusion: The lightweight model improves spatial awareness and is suitable for real-time edge deployment in smart farming.

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

*Chengchao Shen,Dawei Liu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method called Multiple Object Stitching (MOS) improves unsupervised representation for multi-object images by stitching single-object images, leveraging predetermined object correspondences without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning struggles with multi-object images, limiting representation quality for downstream tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation.

Method: MOS synthesizes multi-object images by stitching single-object ones, providing additional object correspondences for better unsupervised representation.

Result: MOS outperforms existing methods on ImageNet, CIFAR, and COCO datasets for both single and multi-object images.

Conclusion: MOS offers a simple yet effective solution for enhancing unsupervised representation in multi-object scenarios, benefiting complex downstream tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

TL;DR: C3S3 is a novel semi-supervised medical image segmentation model that improves boundary delineation and precision using complementary competition and contrastive selection, outperforming existing methods by at least 6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of insufficient annotated medical samples and poor boundary detail capture in current semi-supervised methods, which leads to diagnostic inaccuracies.

Method: Introduces Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning for boundary refinement and Dynamic Complementary Competition with two sub-networks for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Validated on MRI and CT datasets, C3S3 achieves superior performance, with at least 6% improvement on 95HD and ASD metrics.

Conclusion: C3S3 significantly enhances medical image segmentation precision, particularly in boundary delineation, offering a robust solution for semi-supervised challenges.

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC), a deep generative model-based approach for ultra-low bitrate face video compression, outperforming traditional methods like VVC. It reviews existing GFVC techniques, benchmarks them, creates a quality assessment database, and discusses standardization and future applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-fidelity face video compression at ultra-low bitrates, leveraging deep generative models for compact representation and lifelike synthesis.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of GFVC methods, benchmarks them, constructs a quality assessment database with MOSs, and proposes standardization and low-complexity system designs.

Result: GFVC surpasses VVC in performance, and the study identifies optimal quality metrics, standardization potentials, and practical deployment strategies.

Conclusion: GFVC holds significant promise for industrial applications, though challenges remain, offering future research and standardization opportunities.

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

*Ruchit Rawal,Reza Shirkavand,Heng Huang,Gowthami Somepalli,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGUS is a new benchmark for VideoLLMs to measure freeform video captioning performance, addressing hallucination and omission issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs hallucinate aggressively in freeform tasks like captioning, and existing benchmarks (e.g., multiple-choice) fail to capture this.

Method: ARGUS compares VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, quantifying hallucination (incorrect statements) and omission (missing details).

Result: The benchmark provides dual metrics: hallucination rate and omission rate, offering a comprehensive view of captioning performance.

Conclusion: ARGUS effectively addresses VideoLLM weaknesses in freeform tasks, providing a robust evaluation framework.

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

*Xunjie He,Christina Dao Wen Lee,Meiling Wang,Chengran Yuan,Zefan Huang,Yufeng Yue,Marcelo H. Ang Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework is proposed to address limitations in existing methods, improving accuracy for diverse road users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative perception works focus mainly on vehicles, lacking solutions for multi-class detection and tracking, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The framework includes a global spatial attention fusion (GSAF) module for detection, a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module for reducing ID switches, and a velocity-based adaptive tracklet management (VATM) module for dynamic tracking.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets in detection and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multi-class collaborative perception challenges, enhancing performance for diverse road users.

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) and proposes the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN) to address domain gaps and scarce data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in CD-FSS, specifically domain gaps and fine-tuning with limited data, by leveraging adapter-based methods for domain information decoupling.

Method: Proposes DFN, a structure-based decoupler, and SAM-SVN to prevent overfitting, followed by fine-tuning DFN on target domains.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: DFN effectively decouples domain-specific information, improving performance in CD-FSS tasks.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MrM is a black-box MIA framework for multimodal RAG systems, addressing privacy vulnerabilities by combining data perturbation and counterfactual attacks to infer membership information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal RAG systems risk exposing sensitive data to privacy attacks, especially MIAs, with visual modality being underexplored.

Method: MrM uses object-aware data perturbation and counterfact-informed mask selection to induce retrieval and leak membership info, followed by statistical inference.

Result: MrM performs strongly on sample- and set-level evaluations across datasets and models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2, and resists defenses.

Conclusion: MrM effectively bridges the gap in visual modality MIA research, demonstrating robust attack efficacy on multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compressed Feature Quality Assessment (CFQA) to evaluate semantic fidelity in compressed features, proposes a benchmark dataset, and evaluates existing metrics, highlighting the need for better metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models in resource-constrained environments require efficient feature transmission, but compression causes semantic degradation, which current metrics fail to quantify effectively.

Method: The authors create a benchmark dataset with 300 original and 12000 compressed features from three vision tasks and four codecs, then evaluate three metrics (MSE, cosine similarity, Centered Kernel Alignment).

Result: The dataset is representative, but existing metrics are insufficient for capturing semantic distortion, indicating a need for refined metrics.

Conclusion: The paper releases the dataset and code to advance CFQA research, providing a foundation for future work on semantic fidelity in compressed features.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DPFormer, a dynamic prompt transformer, to address catastrophic forgetting and inter-task confusion in continual learning using prompt schemes and a unified classification module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the stability-plasticity dilemma and inter-task confusion in continual learning by enabling knowledge retention and exchange between tasks.

Method: Introduces DPFormer with prompt schemes for knowledge retention and a unified classification module with multiple losses (binary cross entropy, knowledge distillation, auxiliary loss) for end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, ImageNet100, and ImageNet1K datasets in class-incremental continual learning.

Conclusion: DPFormer effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and inter-task confusion, demonstrating superior performance in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FAMSeg, a model for fetal femur and cranial ultrasound segmentation, using feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address noise and similarity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ultrasound segmentation is error-prone and time-consuming; existing models struggle with noise and similarity in ultrasound images.

Method: Uses longitudinal/transverse scanning convolution, feature perception, and Mamba-optimized residuals to enhance detail capture and noise suppression.

Result: FAMSeg achieved fastest loss reduction and best segmentation performance across varying image sizes and orientations.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses ultrasound segmentation challenges, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

TL;DR: The study compares five LLMs (Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini 2.0 Pro) for hazard recognition in construction, finding CoT prompting most effective and GPT-4.5/GPT-o3 top performers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on LLM performance in safety-critical visual tasks for construction, despite their potential.

Method: Comparative evaluation of five LLMs using zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting strategies, measured by precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: CoT prompting improved accuracy; GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 performed best. Prompt design is crucial for reliable hazard recognition.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering enhances LLM accuracy for construction safety, aiding AI-assisted safety system development.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces physical mapping to improve motion generation by enforcing physical constraints, addressing artifacts in multi-person scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-capture and generative models often ignore physical constraints, causing artifacts like interpenetration and sliding, especially in multi-person interactions.

Method: The authors use motion imitation in a physics-based simulation to project motions into a physically valid space, introducing Motion Consistency and Marker-based Interaction loss functions.

Result: Experiments show a 3%-89% improvement in physical fidelity for generated human motions.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances motion quality and physical realism, particularly in multi-person scenarios.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Motivation: Existing SLG methods suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic accuracy due to sentence-level conditions, which lack temporal structure and word-level granularity.

Method: Proposes GLOS with gloss-level conditions and a condition fusion module (TAC) to align word-level semantics and temporal structure with motion.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T, generating signs with correct order and high accuracy.

Conclusion: GLOS effectively addresses limitations of sentence-level conditions, enhancing SLG performance.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

*Jinyoung Park,Jeehye Na,Jinyoung Kim,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores GRPO for Video LLMs, identifies issues (safeguards and vanishing advantage), and proposes DeepVideo-R1 with Reg-GRPO and difficulty-aware data augmentation to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied application of GRPO to Video LLMs and its learning challenges, such as reliance on safeguards and vanishing advantage.

Method: Proposes Reg-GRPO (a regression-based reformulation of GRPO) and a difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy to enhance training.

Result: DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate GRPO's issues in Video LLMs, leading to better reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

### [106] [Ambiguity-Restrained Text-Video Representation Learning for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07471)
*CH Cho,WJ Moon,W Jun,MS Jung,JP Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning (ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), improving retrieval accuracy by detecting and learning from ambiguous pairs hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the inherent ambiguity between text and video content in PRVR, where existing methods assume a one-to-one relationship, ignoring the conceptual scope overlap.

Method: ARL detects ambiguous pairs using uncertainty and similarity criteria, then hierarchically learns semantic relationships via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. It also explores fine-grained text-frame relationships and cross-model ambiguity detection.

Result: The proposed method effectively improves performance in PRVR by addressing ambiguity and enhancing semantic learning.

Conclusion: ARL successfully mitigates ambiguity in text-video pairs, demonstrating improved retrieval accuracy and robustness in PRVR tasks.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

*Dasol Hong,Wooju Lee,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoA-Mix introduces a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) and confidence-aware weights (CoA-weights) to improve specialization and generalization in prompt tuning for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frozen encoders in prompt tuning often produce misaligned features, causing class confusion and limiting task specialization.

Method: Proposes CoA-loss to refine decision boundaries and CoA-weights in a mixture model to balance specialization and generalization.

Result: CoCoA-Mix outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing both specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses misalignment and confusion in prompt tuning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

*Yahao Shi,Yang Liu,Yanmin Wu,Xing Liu,Chen Zhao,Jie Luo,Bin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveAnyMesh is a 4D diffusion model for generating mesh animations from monocular video, addressing inefficiencies in implicit and skeletal methods while ensuring compatibility with modern rendering engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D generation methods face challenges like low rendering efficiency (implicit methods) and high manual effort (skeletal methods). DriveAnyMesh aims to overcome these by leveraging a diffusion model for efficient, high-quality animations.

Method: The method uses a 4D diffusion model to denoise latent sets decoded into mesh animations. It employs a transformer-based variational autoencoder to capture 3D shape and motion, enhancing efficiency and generalization.

Result: DriveAnyMesh produces high-quality animations for complex motions quickly and is compatible with modern rendering engines.

Conclusion: This method shows promise for gaming and filming industries, offering efficient and generalizable 4D animation generation.

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art
performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object

understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented
reality, embodied robotics, and more.

TL;DR: Genesis is a framework for generating multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with consistency, using a two-stage architecture and shared latent space, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified solution for generating consistent multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences, addressing the need for coherent multi-modal data in autonomous driving research.

Method: Uses a two-stage architecture: a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering. Includes DataCrafter for semantic supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611) on nuScenes, improving downstream tasks like segmentation and 3D detection.

Conclusion: Genesis demonstrates semantic fidelity and practical utility, validating its effectiveness for generating high-quality multi-modal driving data.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view
driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal
consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics
(FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including
segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical
utility of the generated data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoQAE introduces a mixed-precision quantization method for KV cache optimization in LLMs, combining quantization-aware experts, chunk-based routing, and lightweight fine-tuning to balance memory efficiency and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high memory consumption of KV cache in LLMs poses a challenge, and existing quantization methods fail to balance effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: MoQAE uses a mixture of quantization-aware experts, chunk-based routing, lightweight fine-tuning, and mechanisms like routing freezing and sharing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods in efficiency and effectiveness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MoQAE effectively reduces memory usage while maintaining model accuracy, offering a practical solution for long-context inference in LLMs.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: To address the challenges of sim-to-real object detection in manufacturing by generating synthetic data that closely mimics real-world conditions.

Method: A comprehensive data generation pipeline incorporating object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and post-processing, tested on the SIP15-OD and a public robotics dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed domain randomization effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, demonstrating feasibility and identifying key factors like material properties and rendering methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating
synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we
present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different
factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models
trained exclusively on synthetic data; mAP@50 scores of 96.4% for the robotics
dataset, and 94.1%, 99.5%, and 95.3% across three of the SIP15-OD use cases,
respectively. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed domain

TL;DR: The APTOS-2024 Challenge explored AI-based 3D OCT image generation from 2D fundus photos to address accessibility issues, with top solutions leveraging hybrid preprocessing, pre-training, and model improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and specialization limit OCT adoption; 2D fundus images are more accessible. The challenge aimed to bridge this gap using AI for 3D OCT synthesis.

Method: The challenge framework included a benchmark dataset, evaluation metrics (pixel-level and semantic-level fidelity), and analysis of top solutions from 342 teams.

Result: Leading methods used hybrid preprocessing, external dataset pre-training, vision foundation models, and architecture improvements.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT synthesis, potentially improving ophthalmic care accessibility and research.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPTI introduces a method to generate high-resolution DP synthetic images by converting images to text, applying DP text generation, and reconstructing images, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP image synthesis methods fail to produce high-resolution outputs that accurately reflect original data structure, limiting their utility.

Method: SPTI converts private images to text, applies DP text generation (Private Evolution), and reconstructs images using off-the-shelf models without training.

Result: SPTI achieves better FID scores (e.g., 26.71 on LSUN Bedroom, 33.27 on MM CelebA HQ at ε=1.0) than prior methods (40.36 and 57.01, respectively).

Conclusion: SPTI offers a resource-efficient, model-compatible framework for high-resolution DP synthetic images, enhancing access to private visual datasets.

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) to improve virtual staining in digital pathology by addressing overlooked cross-channel correlations between cell nuclei and membranes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing H&E-to-IHC studies neglect cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes, limiting accuracy in pathological image analysis.

Method: CCPL decomposes HER2 staining into nuclei and membrane channels, uses Gigapath's Tile Encoder for feature extraction, measures cross-channel correlations, and employs feature distillation loss and statistical analysis for consistency.

Result: CCPL outperforms in metrics like PSNR, SSIM, PCC, and FID, and is validated by pathologists for preserving features and generating high-quality images.

Conclusion: CCPL enhances virtual staining quality and supports automated pathological diagnosis effectively.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained multimodal data and challenges in flexible multi-conditional dance generation.

Method: Developed OpenDance5D dataset with 5 modalities and proposed OpenDanceNet, a masked modeling framework for controllable generation.

Result: OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability in dance generation.

Conclusion: The work advances dance generation by providing a robust dataset and framework for multimodal and controllable synthesis.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation offers significant creative potential yet faces
considerable challenges. The absence of fine-grained multimodal data and the
difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,
keypoints, or character positioning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

TL;DR: The paper explores writer retrieval performance at line- and word levels, showing performance drops with less text but maintaining strong accuracy with at least four lines. Deep learning methods outperform handcrafted features in low-text scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how text quantity affects writer retrieval performance, moving beyond page-level analysis to line- and word-level evaluation.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems (handcrafted and deep learning-based) on CVL and IAM datasets, testing performance with varying text quantities.

Result: Performance drops 20-30% with one line of text but stays above 90% of full-page accuracy with four lines. Deep learning (NetVLAD) outperforms handcrafted features in low-text cases.

Conclusion: Text-dependent retrieval is viable in low-text scenarios, with deep learning methods showing superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset for indoor layout generation, and OptiScene, an optimized LLM for this task, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for indoor layout generation face issues like spatial inconsistency, high computational costs, and limited generalization. The paper aims to address these by leveraging a new dataset and fine-tuned LLM.

Method: The authors create 3D-SynthPlace, a dataset of 17,000 synthetic scenes, and train OptiScene using a two-stage approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO).

Result: OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines, showing improved layout quality and success rates. It also excels in interactive tasks like scene editing and robot navigation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach, combining a large-scale dataset and fine-tuned LLM, effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates strong performance in indoor layout generation.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

### [119] [Learning Speaker-Invariant Visual Features for Lipreading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07572)
*Yu Li,Feng Xue,Shujie Li,Jinrui Zhang,Shuang Yang,Dan Guo,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFLip is a speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework for lipreading, using disentanglement modules to improve generalization by separating speaker-specific attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lipreading methods suffer from spurious correlations due to speaker-specific features, reducing accuracy and generalization.

Method: SIFLip employs Implicit and Explicit Disentanglement modules: the former uses text embeddings to learn common visual features, while the latter filters speaker-specific features via a recognition sub-task and gradient reversal.

Result: SIFLip outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SIFLip effectively disentangles speaker-specific features, improving lipreading accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Hu Zhang,Hao Fei,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-o is a model-agnostic framework for evaluating and quantifying uncertainty in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse modalities and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified methods for evaluating, prompting, and quantifying uncertainty in LMMs.

Method: Introduces Uncertainty-o, a framework for model-agnostic uncertainty evaluation, explores multimodal prompt perturbations, and formulates multimodal semantic uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across 18 benchmarks and 10 LMMs, improving tasks like hallucination detection and mitigation.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-o reliably estimates LMM uncertainty, enhancing downstream applications.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), harnessing the complementarity among diverse
modalities, are often considered more robust than pure Language Large Models
(LLMs); yet do LMMs know what they do not know? There are three key open
questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

### [121] [Super Encoding Network: Recursive Association of Multi-Modal Encoders for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07576)
*Boyu Chen,Siran Chen,Kunchang Li,Qinglin Xu,Yu Qiao,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Super Encoding Network (SEN) to enhance video understanding by enabling deeper multi-modal interactions through recursive association of encoders, outperforming existing methods in tasks like tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal foundation models lack deeper multi-modal interactions, which are crucial for understanding complex video scenes and movements.

Method: Proposes SEN, treating pre-trained encoders as 'super neurons' and using a Recursive Association (RA) block to fuse multi-modalities recursively.

Result: SEN improves performance in four video tasks, e.g., boosting tracking accuracy by 2.7% and editing alignment by 6.4%.

Conclusion: SEN effectively encodes deeper multi-modal interactions, enhancing video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

*Jiacheng Shi,Yanfu Zhang,Huajie Shao,Ashley Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel security threat in diffusion models allows attackers to generate synthetic images via APIs, train substitute models, and execute adversarial attacks on black-box models with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight security and privacy risks in diffusion models, such as copyright violations and malicious content creation, and demonstrate a new attack method.

Method: Leveraging diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic images for training substitute models, enabling efficient adversarial attacks without original training data.

Result: Achieves 27.37% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with 0.01x query budget and 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The study reveals a significant security vulnerability in diffusion models, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such attacks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

*Nianbo Zeng,Haowen Hou,Fei Richard Yu,Si Shi,Ying Tiffany He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneRAG is a framework for video understanding that segments videos into narrative-consistent scenes using ASR transcripts and temporal metadata, improving retrieval and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods disrupt video context by using fixed-length chunks, failing to capture authentic scene boundaries, which SceneRAG addresses by mimicking human scene organization.

Method: SceneRAG uses large language models to segment videos into coherent scenes, refines boundaries with heuristics, and builds a knowledge graph from visual and textual data for multi-hop retrieval.

Result: SceneRAG outperforms baselines on the LongerVideos benchmark, achieving a 72.5% win rate on generation tasks.

Conclusion: SceneRAG effectively handles long-form video understanding by preserving contextual continuity and leveraging multimodal data for robust retrieval and generation.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets hinders progress in surgical video foundation models, limiting automated intraoperative decision-making and skill assessment.

Method: SurgBench includes SurgBench-P (53M frames, 22 procedures, 11 specialties) and SurgBench-E (72 tasks across 6 categories). Pretraining on SurgBench-P is evaluated.

Result: Existing video FMs struggle with generalization, but pretraining on SurgBench-P improves performance and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: SurgBench provides a robust framework for advancing surgical video understanding, with pretraining on SurgBench-P enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is pivotal for enabling automated intraoperative
decision-making, skill assessment, and postoperative quality improvement.
However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains
hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and
systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain
generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragNeXt redefines drag-based image editing as deformation, rotation, and translation of handle regions, addressing ambiguity and quality issues with a Latent Region Optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drag-based image editing methods are ambiguous and cumbersome, leading to poor results.

Method: Proposes DragNeXt, a framework using Latent Region Optimization and Progressive Backward Self-Intervention for simpler, higher-quality editing.

Result: DragNeXt outperforms existing methods on NextBench, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: DragNeXt simplifies and improves drag-based image editing by leveraging region-level structure and progressive guidance.

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

*Zikang Leng,Archith Iyer,Thomas Plötz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares video-based and language-based virtual IMU data generation against traditional augmentation, showing virtual IMU data improves HAR performance, especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of labeled HAR datasets by evaluating cross-modality transfer methods for generating virtual IMU data.

Method: Direct comparison of video-based, language-based, and classical augmentation techniques, tested on benchmark HAR datasets using four models.

Result: Virtual IMU data outperforms real or augmented data alone, particularly in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies, highlighting pros and cons of each approach.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

*Haotong Qin,Cheng Hu,Michele Magno*

TL;DR: EP-VLM improves VLM efficiency by using event-based motion priors to sparsify visual inputs, achieving 50% FLOPs savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of VLMs hinder deployment on edge devices due to redundant visual processing.

Method: EP-VLM uses event data to guide patch-wise sparsification of RGB inputs and employs a position-preserving tokenization strategy.

Result: 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% accuracy on RealWorldQA compared to Qwen2-VL-2B.

Conclusion: Event-based vision priors enhance VLM efficiency, enabling sustainable edge deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

TL;DR: HuSc3D is a new dataset for benchmarking 3D reconstruction models under real-world challenges like dynamic backgrounds and color discrepancies, featuring intricate white sculptures with varying image counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack realism, failing to address complexities like dynamic backgrounds and color variations in real-world scenes.

Method: Introduces HuSc3D, a dataset with detailed white sculptures, varying image counts, and minimal texture/color variation.

Result: HuSc3D effectively differentiates model performance, revealing sensitivity to fine details, color ambiguity, and data availability.

Conclusion: HuSc3D fills a gap in benchmarking by exposing limitations masked by conventional datasets.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraEdgeNet introduces a multi-scale edge-enhancement framework for precise automated pollen recognition, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pollen recognition methods are inefficient and subjective, and existing deep learning models lack localization accuracy for microscopic targets.

Method: HieraEdgeNet combines three modules: Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM), Synergistic Edge Fusion (SEF), and Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel Module (CSPOKM), to enhance edge features and refine details.

Result: Achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.9501 on a 120-class pollen dataset, surpassing YOLOv12n and RT-DETR.

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet offers a robust, efficient solution for high-precision microscopic object detection by integrating edge information.

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

TL;DR: ROBIN, an instruction-tuned MLM, improves visual relationship reasoning by generating high-quality dense scene graphs using synthetic data (SVG) and a self-distillation framework (SG-EDIT). It outperforms larger models despite smaller training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise reasoning over visual relationships remains a challenge in multimodal language models (MLMs), despite advances in visual comprehension.

Method: ROBIN is trained on SVG, a synthetic dataset with densely annotated relationships, refined using GPT-4o via SG-EDIT for accuracy.

Result: ROBIN-3B outperforms similar-size models and larger models (up to 13B) on benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance (88.9) in referring expression comprehension.

Conclusion: Refined scene graph data is crucial for high performance in diverse visual reasoning tasks, as demonstrated by ROBIN's success.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

TL;DR: FMaMIL is a two-stage weakly supervised framework for lesion segmentation in histopathology images using only image-level labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lesion segmentation in histopathology is crucial but hindered by costly pixel-level annotations.

Method: FMaMIL uses a Mamba-based encoder for long-range dependencies and a frequency-domain module for spatial awareness. CAMs guide segmentation, refined via soft-label supervision and self-correction.

Result: FMaMIL surpasses existing weakly supervised methods on public and private datasets.

Conclusion: FMaMIL is effective for digital pathology, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations.

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

TL;DR: ProSplat is a two-stage framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis in wide-baseline scenarios, combining 3D Gaussian primitives and a diffusion-based improvement model with MORI and DWEA techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation of 3D Gaussian Splatting in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) generate 3D Gaussian primitives, (2) enhance rendered views using a diffusion-based model with MORI and DWEA for texture and geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves an average 1 dB PSNR improvement over SOTA methods on RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets.

Conclusion: ProSplat effectively improves rendering quality in wide-baseline conditions through its innovative two-stage approach and training strategy.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through

TL;DR: OpenSplat3D extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without manual labels, using feature-splatting and language embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3DGS for fine-grained scene understanding by enabling text-driven instance segmentation without labeled data.

Method: Combines feature-splatting with Segment Anything Model masks and contrastive loss, plus vision-language model embeddings for text-driven identification.

Result: Effective instance segmentation on LERF-mask, LERF-OVS, and ScanNet++ datasets.

Conclusion: OpenSplat3D successfully integrates semantic and instance-level understanding into 3DGS, enabling flexible, language-based object segmentation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

*Yuxiao Yang,Peihao Li,Yuhong Zhang,Junzhe Lu,Xianglong He,Minghan Qin,Weitao Wang,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOVA3D is a novel framework for single-image-to-3D generation, using 3D priors from a video diffusion model and a Geometry-Temporal Alignment mechanism to enhance multi-view consistency and texture fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D AIGC often lack adequate 3D priors, leading to poor multi-view consistency. NOVA3D aims to address this by leveraging stronger priors and integrating geometric information.

Method: NOVA3D uses a pretrained video diffusion model for 3D priors, introduces Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention for domain integration, and employs a de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm to resolve pose discrepancies.

Result: Experiments show NOVA3D outperforms existing baselines in multi-view consistency and texture fidelity.

Conclusion: NOVA3D advances single-image-to-3D generation by improving multi-view consistency and texture quality through innovative use of video diffusion models and geometric alignment.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by
addressing multi-view inaccuracies and resolving discrepancies in pose
alignment. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NOVA3D over
existing baselines.

*Weilei Wen,Chunle Guo,Wenqi Ren,Hongpeng Wang,Xiuli Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic filter network with global and local branches to address two classes of image degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods ignored diversity in degradation types, using a uniform model. The authors classify degradations into spatial-agnostic (e.g., noise) and spatial-specific (e.g., blurring) types, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: A dynamic filter network integrates global (for spatial-agnostic degradations) and local (for spatial-specific degradations) branches, using attention mechanisms and spatially specific convolution operations.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic filter network effectively handles diverse degradation types, improving image reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

*Ge Wang,Songlin Fan,Hangxu Liu,Quanjian Song,Hewei Wang,Jinfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowV2V improves video editing by using optical flows for motion modeling, ensuring temporal consistency and handling non-rigid motions better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with complex motion patterns and non-rigid object motions, limiting their applicability.

Method: FlowV2V decomposes video editing into first-frame editing and conditional I2V generation, using pseudo flow sequences for alignment.

Result: FlowV2V outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 13.67% and 50.66% improvements on DOVER and warping error metrics.

Conclusion: FlowV2V demonstrates superior performance in maintaining temporal consistency and handling complex motions, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

*Yufei Guo,Yuhan Zhang,Zhou Jie,Xiaode Liu,Xin Tong,Yuanpei Chen,Weihang Peng,Zhe Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReverB-SNN improves SNN accuracy by using real-valued spike activations and binary weights, maintaining efficiency while enhancing information capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary spike activations in SNNs reduce accuracy due to insufficient data information capture.

Method: Uses real-valued spike activations with binary weights, introduces a trainable factor for adaptive weight amplitudes, and employs re-parameterization for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN balances efficiency and accuracy, offering a superior alternative to traditional SNNs.

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Shadi Hamdan,Chonghao Sima,Zetong Yang,Hongyang Li,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETA introduces an asynchronous system to shift computations of large models to previous time steps, enabling timely responses while maintaining near-real-time inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dilemma of balancing large model benefits with inference speed in self-driving systems.

Method: Uses a dual-system architecture with feature propagation, small model extraction, and action mask integration.

Result: Achieves 8% performance improvement (69.53 driving score) on Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2 with 50 ms inference speed.

Conclusion: ETA effectively combines large model benefits with real-time responsiveness in self-driving systems.

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

*Xuemei Chen,Huamin Wang,Hangchi Shen,Shukai Duan,Shiping Wen,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeSMOKE, a low-power monocular 3D object detection method using SNNs, introduces CSGC for enhanced feature representation and a lightweight residual block for efficiency, achieving competitive results with significant energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high energy consumption in 3D object detection, especially for autonomous driving, by leveraging the low-power characteristics of SNNs.

Method: Proposes SpikeSMOKE with CSGC (cross-scale gated coding mechanism) for feature enhancement and a lightweight residual block to reduce computation.

Result: Achieves improved AP scores on KITTI dataset (e.g., +2.82 on Easy) with 72.2% energy reduction and minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE offers an efficient, low-power solution for 3D object detection, balancing performance and energy savings.

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

*Lanjiong Li,Guanhua Zhao,Lingting Zhu,Zeyu Cai,Lequan Yu,Jian Zhang,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssetDropper is a framework for extracting standardized assets from reference images, addressing challenges like perspective distortion and occlusion. It uses a reward-driven approach for precise extraction and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers prefer standardized asset libraries, but generative models haven't sufficiently enhanced this domain. Efficient extraction of high-quality assets from open-world scenes remains a challenge.

Method: AssetDropper extracts front views of subjects from images, handling complex scenarios. It uses a synthetic dataset and a real-world benchmark, along with a pre-trained reward model for closed-loop feedback.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in asset extraction, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: AssetDropper effectively bridges the gap in generative capabilities for standardized asset libraries, offering a robust solution for designers.

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArchDiffBench, a dataset of architectural images, and ArchiLense, a framework for automated style analysis, achieving high accuracy in recognition and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional architectural studies rely on subjective expert interpretations and suffer from biases. This study aims to provide an objective, automated approach using computer vision and deep learning.

Method: Constructed the ArchDiffBench dataset and developed ArchiLense, a framework combining Vision-Language Models, computer vision, and machine learning for style analysis.

Result: ArchiLense achieved 92.4% consistency with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effectively capturing stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an objective, accurate alternative to traditional architectural analysis, enhancing comparative studies.

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-Anything is a framework for generating optical flow training data from real-world single-view images, addressing domain gaps and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of synthetic datasets for optical flow estimation and bridge the domain gap in real-world applications.

Method: Uses monocular depth estimation to convert images into 3D representations, then employs Object-Independent Volume Rendering and Depth-Aware Inpainting to generate realistic datasets.

Result: Outperforms advanced unsupervised and supervised methods on synthetic datasets and enhances downstream video tasks.

Conclusion: Flow-Anything demonstrates the potential of real-world image-derived datasets for optical flow estimation and broader video applications.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Difference Inversion, a method to generate image B' by isolating and applying the difference between A and A' to B, using stable diffusion models for broader applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods tied to specific models, aiming for a model-agnostic approach to image editing.

Method: Uses Difference Inversion with Delta Interpolation, Token Consistency Loss, and Zero Initialization of Token Embeddings to extract and apply differences accurately.

Result: Outperforms baselines quantitatively and qualitatively, generating more feasible B' images.

Conclusion: Difference Inversion offers a plug-and-play, model-agnostic solution for image editing, improving over existing methods.

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

semantic category similarity and user behavior simulation. Our pipeline
extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%

TL;DR: VLAgent is an AI system that improves multimodal visual-text reasoning by generating step-by-step plans and refining execution via neuro-symbolic modules, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) lack generalization performance, prompting the development of VLAgent for better visual reasoning.

Method: VLAgent uses in-context learning to generate plans, a syntax-semantics parser to correct errors, and ensemble methods for execution, integrating planning and verification.

Result: VLAgent significantly outperforms existing VLMs and LLM-based approaches (e.g., ViperGPT, VisProg) on benchmarks like GQA, MME, NLVR2, and VQAv2.

Conclusion: VLAgent's novel modules (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers) enhance multimodal reasoning, demonstrating its superiority over current methods.

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

*Beining Xu,Junxian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-spectrum dataset and a task-aware evaluation framework for visible-infrared image fusion, highlighting the gap in current evaluation practices and demonstrating the superiority of task-optimized fusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of visible-infrared image fusion lack standardized benchmarks and downstream task performance metrics, hindering progress. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The authors construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection performance.

Result: Fusion models optimized for downstream tasks outperform others in target detection, especially in challenging conditions. Some algorithms with strong general metrics fail in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a dataset, evaluation framework, and comparative analysis, validating the need for task-aware evaluation and offering insights for future research.

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our

*Qi Yang,Chenghao Zhang,Lubin Fan,Kun Ding,Jieping Ye,Shiming Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCTS, a multimodal RAG framework for LVLMs, addressing knowledge scarcity and erratic responses by enriching the knowledge base with reasoning context and using a tree search re-ranking method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs face challenges like limited reasoning examples and inconsistent responses in VQA tasks, prompting the need for improved knowledge retrieval and utilization.

Method: Proposes RCTS: a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) for re-ranking retrieved knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA datasets, outperforming In-Context Learning and Vanilla-RAG methods.

Conclusion: RCTS effectively enhances LVLMs by improving knowledge quality and retrieval consistency, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

*Eduard Allakhverdov,Dmitrii Tarasov,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to interpret vision encoders' internal features via image reconstruction, comparing SigLIP and SigLIP2 models and ranking encoders by feature informativeness. It reveals color encoding is controlled by orthogonal rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how vision encoders internally represent features, given their widespread use in vision-only and multimodal systems.

Method: Proposes image reconstruction to interpret features, comparing SigLIP and SigLIP2 models and applying the method to various encoders.

Result: Image-based pre-training retains more image information than non-image tasks. Feature manipulation shows orthogonal rotations control color encoding.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into vision encoders' feature spaces and is applicable to any encoder, with code and models available.

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UGTSR, a framework for real image super-resolution, addressing inaccurate feature matching and poor texture detail reconstruction with uncertainty learning, Top-k matching, and an Align-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codebook-based SR methods struggle with inaccurate feature matching and poor texture detail reconstruction.

Method: UGTSR introduces uncertainty learning, Top-k feature matching, and an Align-Attention module to improve feature matching and texture reconstruction.

Result: UGTSR achieves significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed UGTSR framework effectively addresses key challenges in real image super-resolution, with plans to release the code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

*Tieyuan Chen,Huabin Liu,Yi Wang,Chaofan Gan,Mingxi Lyu,Gui Zou,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I-VQA, a task for answering questions without explicit visual evidence, and proposes IRM, a dual-stream reasoning framework, achieving superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VideoQA work relies on explicit visual evidence, which is insufficient for questions about symbolic meanings or deeper intentions, leading to performance gaps.

Method: Proposes IRM with Action-Intent Module (AIM) for clue deduction and Visual Enhancement Module (VEM) for contextual visual representation.

Result: IRM outperforms GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and VideoChat2 by 0.76%, 1.37%, and 4.87%, respectively, and achieves SOTA in related tasks.

Conclusion: IRM effectively addresses implicit reasoning in VideoQA, validated by experiments, and sets new benchmarks for implicit understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in
anonymous repo: https://github.com/tychen-SJTU/Implicit-VideoQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasArbi is a self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution, outperforming existing methods by breaking scaling into sequential steps and using a coordinate-guided residual diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed-scale super-resolution lacks flexibility, and single-stage upsampling struggles with continuous scaling factors. Progressive upsampling with diffusion models is underexplored.

Method: CasArbi uses a self-cascaded diffusion framework, breaking scaling into smaller sequential factors and employing a coordinate-guided residual diffusion model for continuous image representation.

Result: CasArbi achieves superior perceptual and distortion performance metrics across arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

Conclusion: CasArbi advances arbitrary-scale super-resolution by integrating progressive upsampling with diffusion models, offering flexibility and improved performance.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

*Yongzhen Wang,Yongjun Li,Zhuoran Zheng,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2Restore is a Mixture-of-Experts-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for all-in-one image restoration, addressing generalization and detail preservation challenges with CLIP-guided MoE gating, dual-stream architecture, and edge-aware dynamic gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural images suffer from composite degradations (rain, snow, haze), impacting vision applications. Existing methods struggle with generalization and balancing local-global details.

Method: Proposes M2Restore: CLIP-guided MoE gating for generalization, dual-stream (Mamba-CNN) for global-local balance, and edge-aware gating for adaptive restoration.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: M2Restore effectively addresses generalization and detail preservation in image restoration.

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R3D2 is a lightweight diffusion model for realistic 3D asset insertion in autonomous driving simulations, overcoming limitations of neural reconstruction methods like 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation platforms for autonomous driving validation are resource-intensive and lack realism, while neural reconstruction methods struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability.

Method: R3D2 is trained on a novel dataset of 3DGS object assets generated from real-world AD data, enabling realistic rendering effects like shadows and lighting in real time.

Result: R3D2 enhances realism of inserted assets, enabling text-to-3D insertion and cross-scene object transfer, improving scalability for AD validation.

Conclusion: R3D2 advances photorealistic simulation for AD validation, with plans to release the dataset and code to foster further research.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

### [154] [Diffusion models under low-noise regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07841)
*Elizabeth Pavlova,Xue-Xin Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models exhibit memorization and generalization regimes, but their behavior under low-noise conditions is unclear. This study investigates their denoising performance with small perturbations, revealing how training set size, data geometry, and objectives influence model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diffusion models behave under low-noise conditions, as prior work focused on high-noise settings. This has implications for model robustness and interpretability in practical applications.

Method: The study uses CelebA subsets and Gaussian mixture benchmarks to analyze model behavior under low-noise diffusion dynamics, examining factors like training set size, data geometry, and model objectives.

Result: Models trained on disjoint data diverge near the data manifold despite high-noise convergence. Training set size, data geometry, and objectives significantly impact denoising trajectories and score accuracy.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into how diffusion models learn data distributions and addresses gaps in understanding their reliability in practical, low-noise scenarios.

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2Net is a frequency-aware framework for semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution remote sensing images, addressing computational and optimization challenges by decomposing images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning, but existing methods lose fine details or fragment global context.

Method: F2Net decomposes images into high- and low-frequency components. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs with dual sub-branches for short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these, guided by Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss.

Result: F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 on DeepGlobe and 83.39 on Inria Aerial benchmarks.

Conclusion: F2Net effectively balances detail preservation and computational efficiency, offering a robust solution for semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution images.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolyVivid is a framework for multi-subject video customization, ensuring identity consistency and fine-grained control through innovative modules like VLLM-based text-image fusion, 3D-RoPE enhancement, and attention-inherited identity injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack fine-grained controllability and struggle with multi-subject customization, especially in maintaining consistent identity and interaction.

Method: PolyVivid uses a VLLM-based text-image fusion module, a 3D-RoPE enhancement module, and an attention-inherited identity injection module. It also employs an MLLM-based data pipeline for high-quality multi-subject data.

Result: PolyVivid outperforms existing baselines in identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment.

Conclusion: PolyVivid advances multi-subject video generation by addressing identity consistency and controllability, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

*Arash Rocky,Q. M. Jonathan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2Auto is an automated annotation pipeline for video datasets, combining SMART-OD for object detection and FLASH for consistent video instance segmentation, achieving manual-level accuracy without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of annotated datasets for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the high cost and labor of manual annotation.

Method: Uses SMART-OD (automatic mask generation + open-world object detection) and FLASH (real-time video instance segmentation) for consistent, error-minimized annotation.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to manual annotation, reduces time and costs, and works across diverse datasets without retraining.

Conclusion: SAM2Auto sets a new standard for automated video annotation, enabling scalable VLM development by overcoming dataset bottlenecks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogoSP introduces unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation by combining local and global point features, using frequency-domain patterns to generate pseudo-labels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on local features and simple grouping, missing richer semantic priors. LogoSP aims to leverage global patterns for better unsupervised segmentation.

Method: LogoSP groups superpoints based on global frequency-domain patterns to create accurate pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network.

Result: LogoSP achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets, surpassing existing unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: The learned global patterns effectively represent meaningful 3D semantics without human labels, validating LogoSP's approach.

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

TL;DR: A real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras, leveraging foveated vision for efficiency and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cameras have high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, while event cameras offer higher temporal resolution and robustness.

Method: Uses event cameras and foveated vision (eye-gaze data) to process relevant regions, reducing computational latency. A dataset of ping-pong sequences with 3D ground-truth trajectories is collected.

Result: Achieves a 10.81 reduction factor in computational latency, with a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms. Trajectory prediction model enables 3D forecasting.

Conclusion: First approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras, outperforming frame-based systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Motivation: Training VAEs often suffers from artifacts that degrade quality, prompting the need for a systematic solution without major architectural changes.

Method: VIVAT modifies loss weights, padding strategies, and integrates Spatially Conditional Normalization to mitigate artifacts.

Result: Achieves top performance in PSNR and SSIM for reconstruction and improves text-to-image generation with better CLIP scores.

Conclusion: VIVAT provides practical insights for optimizing VAE training while maintaining the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

TL;DR: FreeGave learns 3D scene physics from multi-view videos without object priors, using a physics code and divergence-free module for velocity fields, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex physical motions or require object priors. FreeGave aims to overcome these limitations by learning physics without such priors.

Method: Proposes FreeGave, which uses a physics code and divergence-free module to estimate per-Gaussian velocity fields, avoiding inefficient PINN losses.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation across datasets, with learned physics codes capturing meaningful motion patterns.

Conclusion: FreeGave effectively models 3D scene physics without object priors, validated by experiments and meaningful learned motion patterns.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

*Muhammad Ahmed Humais,Xiaoqian Huang,Hussain Sajwani,Sajid Javed,Yahya Zweiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) for efficient and high-performance optical flow estimation using event cameras, outperforming CNN, RNN, and ViT methods in speed and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras enable low-latency motion estimation, but existing deep learning methods (CNN, RNN, ViT) lack efficiency, while asynchronous methods (SNNs, GNNs) miss spatio-temporal information. The goal is to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes the STSSM module and a novel network architecture to capture spatio-temporal correlations efficiently, leveraging state-space models.

Result: Achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations than TMA, and 2x lower computations than EV-FlowNet, with competitive performance on DSEC benchmark.

Conclusion: The STSSM-based solution offers a highly efficient and performant approach for optical flow estimation with event cameras, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive
performance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively
capture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance
with lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar
settings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations
compared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with
competitive performance on the DSEC benchmark. Our code will be available at

annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoM2P is a masked modeling framework for egocentric 4D understanding, addressing challenges in multimodal data by using efficient temporal tokenizers. It outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction and video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric vision faces challenges due to heterogeneous data and missing modalities, making standard supervised learning difficult. A unified, scalable solution is needed.

Method: Proposes EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework with temporal tokenizers, supporting multitasking across egocentric tasks like gaze prediction and video synthesis.

Result: EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models in tasks like gaze prediction and depth estimation, while being faster.

Conclusion: EgoM2P is a scalable, general-purpose solution for egocentric vision, advancing research with its open-source release.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unlearning technique for video diffusion models to remove harmful biases using minimal multi-modal prompt pairs and a refusal vector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the risk of generating undesirable or illegal content due to biases in web-scale training data of video generative models.

Method: Uses 5 multi-modal prompt pairs (safe/unsafe) to compute a refusal vector via per-layer latent differences, applied to model parameters. Introduces low-rank factorization for robust refusal vectors.

Result: Effectively neutralizes harmful content (e.g., nudity, violence) while preserving generation quality, without retraining or original data.

Conclusion: The method robustly suppresses unsafe concepts by embedding refusal vectors into model weights, outperforming surface-level filters.

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable pipeline for generating multimodal QA pairs, a dataset (WeThink), and a hybrid RL method to enhance general-purpose visual-language reasoning in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending text-based reasoning to multimodal domains and addressing the lack of general-purpose visual-language reasoning methods.

Method: Develops a QA synthesis pipeline, curates the WeThink dataset, and explores hybrid RL with rule-based and model-based rewards.

Result: Significant performance improvement across 14 MLLM benchmarks, including math and general tasks.

Conclusion: The WeThink dataset and automated pipeline effectively enhance multimodal reasoning, with potential for continuous improvement.

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Motivation: The U-Net architecture's potential in remote sensing change detection is underexplored, prompting a comprehensive review to guide researchers and practitioners.

Method: A comparative analysis of 18 U-Net variations, including specialized architectures like Siamese Swin-U-Net, is conducted, assessing their performance in change detection tasks.

Result: The study identifies key aspects like handling multi-temporal data and long-distance relationships as crucial for improving change detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The analysis offers valuable insights for selecting U-Net variants in remote sensing change detection, emphasizing tailored architectures for better performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs' in-context learning (ICL) is often shallow, relying on copying or majority voting. Performance degrades with more demonstrations, and models copy answers rather than learn. A new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline improves little, showing VLMs don't effectively use demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether VLMs truly exhibit multimodal ICL (MM-ICL) or rely on shallow heuristics, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: Proposed MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline, adding generated rationales to demonstrations. Tested on perception and reasoning datasets with VLMs (3B-72B) and proprietary models like Gemini 2.0.

Result: Performance often degrades with more demonstrations; models copy answers. Limited sensitivity to shot count, retrieval, rationale quality, or distribution.

Conclusion: Current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information in MM-ICL, questioning their true task understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

*Yizhen Li,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTwinSeger introduces a two-stage RS approach using Digital Twin (DT) representation to decouple perception from reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS methods disrupt spatial relationships due to tokenization; DTwinSeger aims to preserve these while enhancing reasoning.

Method: Transforms images into structured DT representations, then uses an LLM for reasoning. Includes supervised fine-tuning and dataset Seg-DT.

Result: Achieves top performance on RS and referring segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: DT representation bridges vision and text, enabling complex reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Result: A structured dataset of over six million entries, useful for studying migration, urbanization, family dynamics, and disease spread.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates the potential of deep learning to convert archival material into research-ready data, as shown in a case study of Elimäki parish.

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

TL;DR: SpaCE-10 is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' spatial intelligence, covering atomic and compositional capabilities with 5k QA pairs, revealing gaps between MLLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial intelligence, necessitating a new benchmark like SpaCE-10.

Method: Defined 10 atomic and 8 compositional spatial capabilities, used a hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate 5k QA pairs from 811 indoor scenes.

Result: Advanced MLLMs lag behind humans significantly, with counting capability being a major limitation.

Conclusion: SpaCE-10 provides a robust benchmark for spatial intelligence evaluation, highlighting areas for MLLM improvement.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are

TL;DR: CyberV introduces a cybernetic framework to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video understanding by enabling self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation during inference, improving accuracy and robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long or complex videos due to computational demands, lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, especially in smaller models.

Method: CyberV redesigns video MLLMs as adaptive systems with a cybernetic loop (MLLM Inference System, Sensor, Controller) for self-monitoring and dynamic correction during inference.

Result: CyberV improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.3%, InternVL3-8B by 5.5%, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B by 10.0% on benchmarks, outperforming GPT-4o and matching human performance.

Conclusion: CyberV effectively enhances MLLMs for dynamic video understanding, demonstrating consistent gains on benchmarks and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluations, especially in reasoning and stylization, despite advancements in model capabilities.

Method: OneIG-Bench is designed for fine-grained evaluation across dimensions like prompt-image alignment, text rendering, reasoning, stylization, and diversity, allowing flexible subset evaluations.

Result: The benchmark enables detailed analysis of T2I model performance, identifying strengths and bottlenecks, and is publicly available for reproducible research.

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench fills critical gaps in T2I evaluation, supporting researchers in systematic model assessment and comparison.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, cost-effective solution for accurate 3D ball tracking in football environments.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient method for real-time three-dimensional

demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football

TL;DR: CXR-LT 2024 expands a community-driven initiative to improve lung disease classification using chest X-rays, introducing a larger dataset, zero-shot learning, and three tasks to address long-tailed and rare disease challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance lung disease classification by addressing open long-tailed challenges, improving measurability of techniques, and expanding disease coverage for real-world clinical relevance.

Method: Expands dataset to 377,110 CXRs with 45 disease labels, introduces zero-shot learning, and features three tasks: long-tailed classification on noisy and gold-standard subsets, and zero-shot generalization.

Result: Provides a comprehensive resource for model development, consolidates state-of-the-art solutions, and advances clinically realistic diagnostic models.

Conclusion: CXR-LT 2024 aims to advance generalizable diagnostic models for chest radiography by leveraging expanded data and innovative approaches.

Abstract: The CXR-LT series is a community-driven initiative designed to enhance lung
disease classification using chest X-rays (CXR). It tackles challenges in open
long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of
state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve
these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development
and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting
lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT
2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45
disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a
new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the
previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

### [177] [Rethinking Crowd-Sourced Evaluation of Neuron Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07985)
*Tuomas Oikarinen,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective and accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy for neuron explanations, using importance sampling and Bayesian aggregation to reduce costs and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating neuron explanations are noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results.

Method: Develops a novel evaluation pipeline using importance sampling to select valuable inputs and Bayesian aggregation to reduce label noise.

Result: Achieves ~30x cost reduction with importance sampling and ~5x reduction in required ratings with Bayesian aggregation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable large-scale, reliable comparisons of neuron explanation quality for vision models.

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACA, a method to improve text-image alignment in MM-DiTs by addressing token imbalance and timestep-aware attention issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art MM-DiT models struggle with precise alignment between text prompts and generated content due to cross-modal attention suppression and lack of timestep-aware weighting.

Method: Proposes Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA), which dynamically rebalances multimodal interactions using temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment, combined with LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: TACA significantly enhances text-image alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark, improving object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships in models like FLUX and SD3.5.

Conclusion: Balancing cross-modal attention is crucial for semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models, and TACA offers a parameter-efficient solution.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PairEdit is a visual editing method that learns complex editing semantics from image pairs without textual guidance, improving content consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual descriptions alone are insufficient for precise editing semantics, and existing methods rely on text prompts or implicit instructions.

Method: PairEdit uses target noise prediction with a guidance direction term, a content-preserving noise schedule, and distinct LoRAs to disentangle semantic learning.

Result: PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics and improves content consistency over baselines.

Conclusion: PairEdit offers a robust solution for learning editing semantics from image pairs without textual guidance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

*Ming-Feng Li,Xin Yang,Fu-En Wang,Hritam Basak,Yuyin Sun,Shreekant Gayaka,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Pose is an uncertainty-aware method for 6D object pose estimation and online completion, designed for partial references, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require complete 3D models or extensive reference images, posing challenges for partial references. UA-Pose addresses this gap.

Method: UA-Pose uses partial RGBD images or a single 2D image to initialize a 3D model, integrates uncertainty for confidence assessment, and employs uncertainty-aware sampling for online completion.

Result: UA-Pose shows significant improvements on YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, especially with incomplete observations.

Conclusion: UA-Pose enhances robustness and accuracy in 6D pose estimation and object completion for partial references.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

*Junhao Chen,Yulia Tsvetkov,Xiaochuang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MADFormer combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models for multimodal generation, optimizing performance and efficiency through block-wise partitioning and vertical mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid AR-diffusion models lack systematic guidance on capacity allocation, prompting the need for a structured approach to leverage their complementary strengths.

Method: MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial blocks, using AR layers for global conditioning and diffusion layers for local refinement.

Result: Block-wise partitioning improves high-resolution image performance, and vertical mixing enhances quality-efficiency balance, boosting FID by up to 75%.

Conclusion: MADFormer provides practical design principles for future hybrid generative models, demonstrating the benefits of structured AR-diffusion integration.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable machines to understand and interact with 3D environments, inspired by advances in language and image modeling.

Method: A unified LLM framework aligning multiple modalities, with detailed design choices for training and performance. Evaluated on rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering tasks.

Result: Effective performance across synthetic and real-world 3D datasets, with successful extension to complex 3D object shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for advancing 3D scene understanding and interaction, with practical applications in design and robotics.

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating
and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in
language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on
real-world 3D object recognition tasks. Project webpage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTV is a framework for audio-sync video generation, separating audio into speech, effects, and music tracks for precise control. DEMIX dataset supports training, and MTV achieves top performance in video quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack high-quality video generation with precise audio-visual synchronization, especially for diverse audio types.

Method: MTV disentangles audio into speech, effects, and music tracks for fine-grained control. DEMIX dataset enables multi-stage training.

Result: MTV outperforms in video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment across six metrics.

Conclusion: MTV provides a versatile and effective solution for audio-sync video generation, supported by the DEMIX dataset.

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without weight updates or auxiliary modules, addressing challenges in deterministic inversion due to zero-terminal SNR schedules.

Method: Redesigns noise initialization in a pre-trained video diffusion model, introduces K-order Recursive Noise Representation for latent alignment, and uses Stochastic Latent Modulation for visibility-aware sampling.

Result: Demonstrates effective dynamic view synthesis through structured latent manipulation in noise initialization.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without additional training or modules.

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VO methods rely on predefined camera setups, limiting adaptability. ZeroVO aims to generalize across diverse, unseen environments without calibration or fine-tuning.

Method: 1. Calibration-free, geometry-aware network. 2. Language-based semantic prior for robust features. 3. Semi-supervised training with unlabeled data for adaptation.

Result: 30% improvement over prior methods on KITTI, nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a GTA-derived synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: ZeroVO offers a versatile, scalable VO solution for real-world deployment by eliminating calibration and fine-tuning needs.

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

TL;DR: Dreamland combines physics-based simulators and generative models for controllable, photorealistic video generation, improving image quality and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models lack element-wise controllability, limiting their use in scene editing and AI agent training.

Method: Dreamland uses a layered world abstraction to bridge simulators and generative models, enhancing control and minimizing adaptation costs.

Result: Dreamland outperforms baselines with 50.8% better image quality and 17.9% stronger controllability.

Conclusion: Dreamland shows great potential for enhancing embodied agent training and will release code and data.

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

*Stephanie Fu,Tyler Bonnen,Devin Guillory,Trevor Darrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs perform worse than their visual encoders on vision-centric tasks due to ineffective use of visual information and language priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs integrate visual and linguistic information and diagnose their failure modes on vision tasks.

Method: Compare VLMs to their visual encoders across vision benchmarks, analyze degradation of vision representations, task prompt brittleness, and language model's role.

Result: VLMs perform near-chance on vision tasks, with the bottleneck being ineffective visual information usage and inherited language priors.

Conclusion: The study diagnoses VLM failures and provides evaluations for future research on visual understanding in VLMs.

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self Forcing is a training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models, addressing exposure bias by conditioning frame generation on self-generated outputs during training, achieving real-time video generation with high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve exposure bias in autoregressive video diffusion models, where models must generate sequences based on imperfect outputs during inference.

Method: Uses autoregressive rollout with KV caching during training, a holistic video-level loss, few-step diffusion, stochastic gradient truncation, and rolling KV cache for efficiency.

Result: Achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, matching or surpassing slower non-causal models.

Conclusion: Self Forcing effectively balances computational cost and performance, enabling high-quality real-time video generation.

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers, identifies neurons causing irregular attention, and proposes a training-free method to mitigate these issues by shifting activations to an untrained token.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address noisy attention maps caused by high-norm tokens in Vision Transformers without requiring retraining.

Method: Shifts high-norm activations from identified neurons to an untrained token, mimicking register tokens' effects.

Result: Produces cleaner attention/feature maps, improves downstream task performance, and matches models trained with register tokens.

Conclusion: Test-time registers offer a training-free solution for pre-trained models, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

TL;DR: ViGaL, a post-training paradigm using arcade-like games, enhances multimodal reasoning in MLLMs without domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by cognitive science, gameplay is used to develop transferable reasoning skills in MLLMs.

Method: Post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via RL on simple games (e.g., Snake) to improve reasoning.

Result: Outperforms specialist models on multimodal reasoning benchmarks while maintaining general visual performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic games can unlock generalizable reasoning in MLLMs, offering a scalable post-training approach.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: StableMTL leverages diffusion models for zero-shot multi-task learning, using synthetic datasets and a unified latent loss to scale tasks without per-task balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning often requires extensive annotations; StableMTL aims to overcome this by training on partial or synthetic labels.

Method: Uses a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task conditioning, and a task-attention mechanism for cross-task sharing.

Result: Outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

Conclusion: StableMTL effectively scales multi-task learning with synthetic data and a unified loss, enhancing inter-task synergy.

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

*Zhen Xu,Zhengqin Li,Zhao Dong,Xiaowei Zhou,Richard Newcombe,Zhaoyang Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DGT is a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos, offering efficient, feed-forward inference and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify static and dynamic scene components and model complex, time-varying environments efficiently.

Method: Uses 4D Gaussian as inductive bias, processes 64 consecutive frames in a rolling-window, and employs a novel density control strategy for efficiency.

Result: Reduces reconstruction time from hours to seconds, outperforms Gaussian-based networks, and matches optimization-based methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: 4DGT is a scalable, efficient solution for dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

*Shuangyan Deng,Haizhou Peng,Jiachen Xu,Chunhou Liu,Ciprian Doru Giurcuaneanu,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new benchmark evaluates AI models' financial reasoning with 3,200 expert-level QA pairs across 15 topics, combining text and visuals. An error-aware learning framework improves performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance AI models' financial reasoning, especially in interpreting complex visual and textual data.

Method: Proposes an error-aware learning framework using historical mistakes and feedback for inference, tested on multimodal models.

Result: Multimodal inputs boost performance, and error feedback leads to consistent improvements, though challenges in visual and mathematical reasoning remain.

Conclusion: The benchmark and framework show promise for self-reflective financial AI, with open-sourced code and data.

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also
the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend
graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI
models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in
finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs
across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textual and
visual modalities to reflect authentic analytical challenges in finance. To
address limitations in current reasoning approaches, we propose an error-aware
learning framework that leverages historical model mistakes and feedback to
guide inference, without requiring fine-tuning. Our experiments across
state-of-the-art models show that multimodal inputs significantly enhance
performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and
measurable improvements. The results highlight persistent challenges in visual
understanding and mathematical logic, while also demonstrating the promise of
self-reflective reasoning in financial AI systems. Our code and data can be

*John Beverley,Jim Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for representing non-existent entities using type intersections, avoiding traditional methods like dummy instances or modal logic. It aligns with Basic Formal Ontology, focusing on practical, efficient solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for handling non-existent entities, which either overcommit to metaphysics or introduce inefficiencies.

Method: Models non-existent entities using intersections of actual types, avoiding specific tokens. Grounded in Basic Formal Ontology with a realist approach.

Result: A structured, ontology-driven framework that is computationally viable for handling hypothetical or non-existent entities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and efficient solution for representing non-existent entities, balancing realism and computational feasibility.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities
that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional
entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches
that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a
proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of
actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions
itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments,
emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely
metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to
non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or
introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing
a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to
provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to
hypothetical or non existent entities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Python library, evolvingfuzzysystems, implementing several Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) models to address the lack of public implementations. It evaluates these models on performance metrics and computational complexity, highlighting ePL as efficient for real-world use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in accessible implementations of eFS models, enabling wider adoption and research in adaptive, interpretable machine learning.

Method: Developed a Python library with implementations of eFS models (e.g., ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG). Evaluated using the fetch_california_housing dataset, measuring NRMSE, NDEI, MAPE, execution times, and rule evolution.

Result: ePL emerged as a simple, efficient model balancing accuracy and computational cost, suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The library, evolvingfuzzysystems, promotes research and practical use of eFS by providing accessible implementations and evaluation tools.

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their
ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while
maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available
implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread
adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python
library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models,
including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The
library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools
for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are
evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance
measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional
error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally,
computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule
evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a
simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost,
making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these
models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and
practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

*Muhammad Monjurul Karim,Yan Shi,Shucheng Zhang,Bingzhang Wang,Mehrdad Nasri,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance roadway safety and mobility, discussing adaptations, applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic, prompting the need for advanced frameworks like LLMs.

Method: The paper reviews LLM adaptations (architectural, training, prompting, multimodal) and applications in mobility (traffic flow, signal control) and safety (crash analysis, driver behavior).

Result: LLMs show transformative potential but face challenges like hallucinations, data governance, and deployment issues.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a roadmap for safer, smarter transportation, but responsible innovation is needed to address limitations.

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern
transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of
addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional
engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of
real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural
language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a
promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application
and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key
focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and
multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's
unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes
diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal
control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).
Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation
models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined.
Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM
limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy,
bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety
assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including
advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI
collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient,
verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current
capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative
potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize
safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

*Shruti Kumar,Xiaoyu Chen,Xiaomei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews inconsistencies in terminology for human-AI-robot co-learning/adaptation, explores agent types and task domains, and examines cognitive theories used in studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify terminology, understand diversity in human-agent interactions, and explore theoretical frameworks in co-learning/adaptation research.

Method: A scoping review analyzing existing papers on human-agent collaboration, focusing on terminology, agent types, task domains, and cognitive theories.

Result: Identifies inconsistencies in terminology, diverse interaction scenarios, and varying theoretical frameworks in human-agent co-learning/adaptation studies.

Conclusion: The review highlights the need for standardized terminology and deeper theoretical exploration to advance human-agent collaboration research.

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning
and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this
collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For
example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both
"collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation"
are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle
differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary
research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this
collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this
human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we
are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task
domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration
is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent
interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can
also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different
task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic,
complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive
theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure
human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it
can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent
collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new
frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

TL;DR: MemoryOS is a hierarchical memory management system for LLMs, improving long-term memory and personalization, with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fixed context windows and inadequate memory management in LLMs to enhance long-term memory and personalization.

Method: Proposes MemoryOS with hierarchical storage (short-term, mid-term, long-term) and four modules (Storage, Updating, Retrieval, Generation). Uses FIFO and segmented page strategies for updates.

Result: 49.11% F1 and 46.18% BLEU-1 improvement on GPT-4o-mini, showing better coherence and memory retention.

Conclusion: MemoryOS effectively enhances LLM memory management and personalization, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context
windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of
long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive
experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose
a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and
efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management
principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage
architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating,
Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three
levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term
personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between
storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based
FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page
organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory
integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark
show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the
baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory
retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

### [200] [Will artificial agents pursue power by default?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06352)
*Christian Tarsney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes the idea of power-seeking as a convergent instrumental goal in AI, concluding it has some truth but limited predictive utility without knowing the AI's final goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address debates about whether advanced AI will inherently seek power over humanity by formalizing the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking.

Method: Uses an abstract, decision-theoretic framework to analyze power as a convergent instrumental goal.

Result: Power-seeking is somewhat valid as a convergent goal but lacks predictive utility without details on the AI's final goals.

Conclusion: Instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents likely to achieve near-absolute power, but power-seeking claims are nuanced.

Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued
that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over
humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is
useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed
skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of
instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic
framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental
goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but
might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options
cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive
information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental
convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining
absolute or near-absolute power.

### [201] [Towards Foundation Model on Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06367)
*Jiaxin Pan,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Osama Mohammed,Daniel Hernandez,Rongchuan Zhang,Cheng Cheng,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POSTRA introduces a fully-inductive approach for temporal knowledge graph link prediction, using sinusoidal encodings and message passing to generalize to unseen entities, relations, and timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TKGE models rely on seen elements during inference, limiting transferability to new domains. POSTRA aims to overcome this by learning transferable representations.

Method: The model uses sinusoidal positional encodings for temporal patterns and adaptive message passing for entity/relation representations, agnostic to temporal granularity.

Result: POSTRA achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen TKGs, generalizing to novel elements and improving temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: POSTRA marks progress toward a foundation model for temporal KGs, demonstrating scalability and transferability.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats
(s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform
link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means
the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully
or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during
inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize
to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning
representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable
and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph
link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture
fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation
representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global
temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and
time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and
facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained,
scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot
performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to
novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot
performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a
significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMA improves LLM reasoning by reusing discarded sibling nodes from MCTS, enhancing data quality and reducing sample needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diminishing returns from scaling datasets highlight the need for better data quality, particularly in leveraging overlooked insights from non-optimal reasoning branches in MCTS.

Method: SIGMA reintegrates discarded sibling nodes, using a critique model to identify strengths/weaknesses and a revision model to refine the top-scoring trajectory.

Result: SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy on MATH benchmark with only 30K samples, outperforming models trained on 590K samples.

Conclusion: SIGMA demonstrates that optimizing data quality through sibling-guided refinement significantly improves LLM reasoning and reduces data requirements.

Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to
yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating
high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically
retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling
nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,
and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of
non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in
the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo
Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling
nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes
along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model
identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a
revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring
trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying
the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,
SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH
benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K
samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This
result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly
reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

*Sam Earle,Ahmed Khalifa,Muhammad Umair Nasir,Zehua Jiang,Graham Todd,Andrzej Banburski-Fahey,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScriptDoctor is an LLM-driven system for automated game design in PuzzleScript, integrating generation, testing, and iterative refinement without persistent human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGD approaches rely heavily on human supervision. ScriptDoctor aims to demonstrate how LLMs can autonomously generate and test game content in longer-time-horizon pipelines.

Method: ScriptDoctor uses an iterative loop: human examples ground output, PuzzleScript errors refine code, and search-based agents play-test games.

Result: The system successfully generates and tests novel game content autonomously, showcasing the potential of LLM-based workflows in AGD.

Conclusion: ScriptDoctor exemplifies the feasibility of open-ended, automated LLM-driven game design, reducing reliance on human supervision.

Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game
Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract
conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from
the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision.
Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into
longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines
to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor,
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and
testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description
language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates
and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples
are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the
PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents
play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the
potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game
content.

*Suhana Bedi,Iddah Mlauzi,Daniel Shin,Sanmi Koyejo,Nigam H. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent AI systems in healthcare outperform single-agent systems, but component-optimized systems may underperform in diagnostic accuracy despite strong process metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance in multi-agent AI systems for clinical diagnosis.

Method: Evaluated 2,400 patient cases from MIMIC-CDM dataset across four pathologies, comparing single-agent and multi-agent systems using diagnostic, process, and cost metrics.

Result: Multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, but a component-optimized system with superior process metrics (85.5% accuracy) underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4%).

Conclusion: Successful AI integration in healthcare requires end-to-end system validation, not just component optimization, emphasizing information flow and agent compatibility.

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in
clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization
and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this
relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across
four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,
interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems
(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized
models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,
process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while
multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the
component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and
excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly
underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent
system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in
healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to
information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the
need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics
alone.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle insufficient data volume and quality in subsymbolic AI by leveraging digital twins for AI simulation.

Method: Conducted a systematic survey of 22 primary studies to analyze trends and develop a reference framework aligned with ISO 23247.

Result: Identified technological trends, proposed a reference framework, and provided architectural guidelines for digital twin-enabled AI simulation.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of digital twins in AI simulation and outlines challenges and research opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in
the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI
simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely

new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of

*Yubin Xiao,Di Wang,Rui Cao,Xuan Wu,Boyang Li,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GELD, a novel neural TSP solver, combines global and local views for efficient, scalable solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art models in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural TSP solvers struggle with scalability and efficiency across varying problem sizes, limiting practical use.

Method: GELD integrates a lightweight Global-view Encoder (GE) and heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) with a low-complexity attention mechanism, trained via a two-stage strategy.

Result: GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models in solution quality and speed, and can solve TSPs with up to 744,710 nodes.

Conclusion: GELD offers a scalable, efficient solution for TSPs, enhancing existing solvers and setting a new benchmark for large-scale problems.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial
optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in
neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless,
these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale
TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their
practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP
solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined
local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight
Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich
embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process.
Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing
GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs.
Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training
instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering
both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as
a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions
derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional
computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to
744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying
on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CER is a training-free framework for LLM agents to self-improve by leveraging past experiences in their context window, enhancing adaptability in complex tasks like web navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack environment-specific experiences and continual learning during inference, limiting their performance in sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer, enabling agents to retrieve and augment knowledge for new tasks.

Result: CER achieves 31.9% on VisualWebArena and 36.7% on WebArena, improving GPT-4o baseline by 51.0%.

Conclusion: CER effectively enhances LLM agents' adaptability and performance in complex environments without additional training.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A SysML profile integrates PDDL planning semantics into system models, enabling automated generation of PDDL descriptions for AI planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge system modeling and AI planning by directly embedding PDDL semantics into SysML models.

Method: Defines reusable stereotypes for PDDL concepts (types, predicates, functions, actions) with OCL constraints for consistency. Derived from PDDL 3.1 BNF.

Result: Case study in aircraft manufacturing shows successful generation of PDDL domain and problem descriptions for robotic systems, used for optimized planning.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reusable, model-based bridge between system modeling and AI planning, enhancing engineering design.

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of
planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into
system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as
types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure
syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study
from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a
robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to
generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as
input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach
supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and
provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in
engineering design.

*Guillaume Levy,Cedric Colas,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Thomas Carta,Clement Romac*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WorldLLM combines Bayesian inference, active exploration, and reinforcement learning to improve LLM-based world modeling, enhancing predictive accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts due to lack of grounding.

Method: WorldLLM uses Bayesian inference to refine hypotheses and reinforcement learning for evidence collection, iteratively improving predictions.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy and human-interpretable theories in a textual game environment.

Conclusion: WorldLLM effectively enhances LLM-based world modeling by integrating structured reasoning and exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often
struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific
contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to
ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To
address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world
modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with
reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language
hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined
through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the
proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected
using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the
environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based
predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining
hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives
continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to
manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive
accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment
dynamics.

TL;DR: VisioMath is a new benchmark for evaluating LMMs' mathematical reasoning with image-based answer choices, revealing their limitations despite their general problem-solving prowess.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LMMs lack evaluation in mathematical reasoning with image-based options, a key aspect of multimodal comprehension.

Method: VisioMath includes 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions with image-based answers, testing fine-grained distinctions.

Result: State-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly (45.9% accuracy), highlighting challenges in reasoning over visually similar options.

Conclusion: VisioMath fills a critical gap, providing a testbed for advancing multimodal reasoning research.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

*Andrew Cropper,Filipe Gouveia,David M. Cerna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An approach to shrink the hypothesis space in ILP using background knowledge to remove non-optimal rules, improving learning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of inductive logic programming (ILP) by reducing the hypothesis space before searching, saving time while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses background knowledge to identify and eliminate rules that cannot be part of an optimal hypothesis, implemented via answer set programming.

Result: Significantly reduces learning times (e.g., from 10 hours to 2 seconds) with minimal preprocessing, while preserving predictive accuracy across domains like visual reasoning and game playing.

Conclusion: The approach effectively optimizes ILP by preprocessing the hypothesis space, demonstrating practical benefits in efficiency without compromising results.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The
goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training
examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the
hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background
knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of
the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such
as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It
then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our
approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space
of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains,
including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can
substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies.
For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can
reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

TL;DR: AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent framework, enhances psychological counseling by generating empathetic, emotionally nuanced conversations and personalized treatment plans, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of trained professionals and improve AI's emotional understanding in psychological counseling.

Method: Uses fine-grained emotion classification and multi-agent simulation (PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, PsyRoom B for treatment plans) to create dataset EmoPsy.

Result: Achieves 18-24% improvements in problem orientation, expression, empathy, and communication quality.

Conclusion: AI PsyRoom advances AI-assisted counseling with publicly available datasets and models.

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for
mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large
language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling,
especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a
deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized
treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings,
we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance
psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced
conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a
multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue
reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which
contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues.
We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23%
in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality.
The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for
advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

*Zofia Rudnicka,Janusz Szczepanski,Agnieszka Pregowska*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores training challenges in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and evaluates learning algorithms, including bioinspired rules, for classification accuracy. A bioinspired classifier combining SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) is proposed, balancing temporal precision and computational efficiency. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unique properties of SNNs (temporal dynamics, non-differentiability, sparse activations) make training difficult. The study aims to assess how different learning algorithms impact classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes a bioinspired classifier integrating SNN and LZC. Evaluates algorithms like backpropagation, tempotron, and Spikprop for accuracy and computational cost.

Result: Backpropagation achieves high accuracy but is computationally expensive. Bioinspired algorithms (tempotron, Spikprop) offer efficiency with competitive accuracy, suitable for real-time tasks.

Conclusion: The choice of learning algorithm depends on balancing accuracy and computational cost, tailored to application needs.

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique
properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events,
and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the
influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired
learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired
classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC).
This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and
biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating
efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It
turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent
classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes
it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning
algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational
efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making
them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the
selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off
between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application
constraints.

*Dimitris Panagopoulos,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CA-MIQ is a dual-critic RL framework for SAR missions, dynamically adapting exploration to priority shifts, outperforming baselines in success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems in SAR missions need to adapt to changing priorities while gathering critical information.

Method: CA-MIQ uses extrinsic and intrinsic critics, with a shift detector for transient exploration boosts and critic resets.

Result: CA-MIQ achieves 3-4x higher mission-success rates than baselines, with 100% recovery in multi-shift scenarios.

Conclusion: CA-MIQ is effective for discrete environments with piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions
must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting
to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware
Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever
mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task
reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location
awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers
transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to
re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where
experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of
information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly
four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority
shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios,
achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results
highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with
piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

*Clément Hongler,Andrew Emil*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games, a framework for evaluating LLMs through tasks like summarization, anomaly detection, and debating, using cross-entropy scores and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore what it means for LLMs to 'know' probability measures on text and to extend their evaluation beyond generative sampling.

Method: Formulate Xent Games as computational tasks based on cross-entropy, with single or multi-player setups, and derive them from game-theoretic axioms.

Result: Demonstrates the richness of Xent Games for benchmarking LLM capabilities and proposes evolutionary dynamics to explore this space.

Conclusion: Xent Games offer a versatile and structured approach to measure and benchmark LLM abilities, addressing the challenge of general capability assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

*HaoYang Shang,Xuan Liu,Zi Liang,Jie Zhang,Haibo Hu,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoThinker, a multi-agent LLM framework, addresses cognitive overload in complex tasks by distributing load and managing communication, improving performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex tasks due to cognitive overload, analogous to human cognitive limits described in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT).

Method: Introduces CoThinker, a multi-agent framework that distributes cognitive load via agent specialization and manages transactional load with structured communication and collective working memory.

Result: Empirical validation shows CoThinker outperforms baselines in solution quality and efficiency on complex tasks.

Conclusion: CoThinker provides a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings by leveraging collective cognition and effective load management.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on
complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse
information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation
arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load
capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory
(CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in
the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs
have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded
understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework
designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative
problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by
distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing
transactional load via structured communication and a collective working
memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and
fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over
existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis
reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the
emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering
a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

TL;DR: A probabilistic safety assurance framework integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks to dynamically evaluate and adapt ML-based systems under uncertainty, demonstrated in automotive platooning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in safety-critical systems introduce reasoning failures due to distributional shifts, requiring new safety assessment methods beyond traditional approaches.

Method: Combines SafeML for detecting distributional shifts with Bayesian Networks to model ML failures causally, enabling dynamic safety evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in a simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition, showing benefits of modeling ML failures.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling ML failures in safety assessments can enhance system reliability and adaptability under uncertainty.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical
systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time
decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of
failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between
operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which
rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn
behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such
shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components.
Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that
integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of
a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and
system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an
simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The
findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML
failures in safety assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep research frameworks lack systematic knowledge management, operate inefficiently online, and cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting insightful analysis.

Method: The KDR framework includes offline knowledge organization and online complex computation. KCII, an LLM, bridges knowledge organization and reasoning via unified code generation.

Result: Experiments on 30+ datasets across six tasks show KCII's effectiveness. Integrated into KDR, it outperforms mainstream frameworks in generating insightful reports.

Conclusion: The KDR framework and KCII LLM effectively address deep knowledge analysis challenges, enabling systematic knowledge management and insightful results.

Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and
association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical
reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing
deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic
organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making
it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They
cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to
produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we
propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR})
framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability.
Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to
preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline.
Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of
reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner.
To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above
framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge
organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge
organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes,
transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it
generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain
deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across
six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover,
when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports
with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research
framework.

*Akash Gupta,Amos Storkey,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach is proposed to improve few-shot learning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by distilling task-relevant image features into soft prompts, outperforming in-context learning (ICL) and prompt-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent ICL performance in smaller LMMs due to irrelevant image embedding information.

Method: Meta-learning with soft prompts distilled from task-relevant image features, integrated via an attention-mapper module in LLaVA v1.5.

Result: Outperforms ICL and prompt-tuning on VL-ICL Bench, even under image perturbations.

Conclusion: The method enhances few-shot task adaptation and reasoning in LMMs with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

*Mahnaz Koupaee,Xueying Bai,Mudan Chen,Greg Durrett,Nathanael Chambers,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using causal event graphs to improve LLMs' event reasoning, proposing a collaborative expert-simulated approach for graph generation and demonstrating its utility in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event reasoning is challenging for LLMs, leading to poor performance in tasks like forecasting. Explicit causal representation via graphs could enhance reasoning.

Method: A collaborative approach where LLMs simulate experts discussing semantic relations, consolidated by a final expert, to generate causal graphs.

Result: The approach improves event prediction tasks, producing more informative explanations and achieving competitive results without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Causal event graphs enhance LLMs' reasoning, offering a scalable solution for event-based tasks without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is
important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event
reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections
between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning
tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this
challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A
enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality
during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as
well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to
causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on
specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of
discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate
the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,
and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a
causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more
informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall
approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results
with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction
tasks.

*Xutong Zhao,Tengyu Xu,Xuewei Wang,Zhengxing Chen,Di Jin,Liang Tan,Yen-Ting,Zishun Yu,Zhuokai Zhao,Yun He,Sinong Wang,Han Fang,Sarath Chandar,Chen Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPOC introduces a spontaneous self-correction method for LLMs, enabling real-time corrections in a single pass, improving math reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-correction methods rely on post-generation refinements, lacking real-time corrections. SPOC addresses this gap.

Method: SPOC uses a multi-agent approach (proposer and verifier roles) in one model, synthetic data for fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning for accuracy.

Result: SPOC significantly improves accuracy on benchmarks (e.g., 8.8%-20.0% gains on MATH500, AMC23, and AIME24).

Conclusion: SPOC's real-time self-correction and multi-agent design enhance LLM performance in math reasoning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a
broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the
approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs
self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,
existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone
post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to
elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous
self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a
spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved
solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation
dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively
scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by
assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We
adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for
fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification
and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and
verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves
performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct
models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23,
and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

*Darui Lu,Jordan M. Malof,Willie J. Padilla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An Agentic Framework using LLMs automates the inverse design of photonic metamaterials, integrating deep learning, APIs, and memory for autonomous task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for autonomous scientific research, specifically in designing photonic metamaterials with desired optical properties.

Method: The framework autonomously develops forward deep learning models, uses APIs for simulation/optimization, and applies deep inverse methods for final design.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in automation, reasoning, planning, and adaptability, with novel outputs due to internal reflection and flexibility.

Conclusion: The Agentic Framework successfully automates complex tasks in photonic metamaterial design, showcasing potential for broader scientific applications.

Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model
(LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex
tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and
demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic
metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent
autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses
external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes
memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and
adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and
decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

*Parshin Shojaee,Iman Mirzadeh,Keivan Alizadeh,Maxwell Horton,Samy Bengio,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capabilities and limitations of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using controllable puzzle environments, revealing accuracy collapse at high complexities and inconsistent reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding LRMs' fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations, especially in reasoning traces beyond final answer accuracy.

Method: Systematic investigation using controllable puzzle environments to manipulate complexity while analyzing internal reasoning traces and comparing LRMs with standard LLMs.

Result: LRMs show accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities, inconsistent reasoning, and three performance regimes: standard LLMs outperform in low-complexity, LRMs excel in medium, and both fail in high-complexity tasks.

Conclusion: LRMs have limitations in exact computation and inconsistent reasoning, raising questions about their capabilities despite advantages in medium-complexity tasks.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

### [225] [Deontically Constrained Policy Improvement in Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06959)
*Alena Makarova,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for learning decision policies in MDPs that maximize utility while satisfying deontic logic constraints, combining mission utility with ethical/social constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring RL agents act ethically or follow situational constraints while maximizing utility, bridging mission goals with deontic logic.

Method: Develops a policy improvement variation for MDPs, using Expected Act Utilitarianism logic to enforce constraints and maximize utility.

Result: The method achieves a constrained local maximum of mission utility while satisfying deontic constraints, demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates mission utility and deontic constraints, offering a bi-level structure for value maximization in RL.

Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision
making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures
non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a
utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision
policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in
deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such
as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social,
situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by
prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act
Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over
controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it
reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit
logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as
a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is
implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments
on sample MDPs.

### [226] [Long-Tailed Learning for Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06965)
*Cuong Manh Hoang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) in imbalanced datasets, using self-guided labeling and representation balancing to improve performance on tail classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods perform well on balanced datasets but struggle with real-world imbalanced data, necessitating a solution for long-tailed distributions.

Method: Proposes a self-guided labeling technique for pseudo-label generation and a representation balancing process to enhance focus on tail classes.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GCD in imbalanced scenarios, improving performance on tail classes.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Riley Simmons-Edler,Ryan P. Badman,Felix Baastad Berg,Raymond Chua,John J. Vastola,Joshua Lunger,William Qian,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ForageWorld, a complex environment for studying DRL agents, and applies neuroethology-inspired tools to reveal emergent planning-like behavior in model-free agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing DRL agents are limited, especially as tasks and agents grow more sophisticated. The study aims to bridge neuroscience and AI to uncover hidden learning dynamics.

Method: The authors use ForageWorld, a novel environment mimicking real-world foraging, to analyze DRL agents with behavioral and neural tools, focusing on strategies, memory, and planning.

Result: Model-free RNN-based DRL agents exhibit structured, planning-like behavior without explicit memory modules, revealed through neuroethology-inspired analysis.

Conclusion: The study advocates for interdisciplinary approaches (neuroscience, cognitive science, AI) to understand and align complex DRL agents, offering a reusable analysis framework.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents --
particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than
simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral
analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and
ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable
environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal
foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and
spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying
joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed,
quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning.
Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents
can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics
-- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show
that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with
neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural
dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would
otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis
framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic
methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents
grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and
AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for
ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to
measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how
biological intelligence is studied.

*Yichi Zhang,Jinlong Pang,Zhaowei Zhu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using peer prediction to detect LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing, focusing on annotation tasks, without relying on ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLM use by crowdsourcing workers risks compromising datasets meant to reflect human input, necessitating detection methods for LLM-generated responses.

Method: The study proposes a training-free peer prediction mechanism that quantifies correlations between worker answers, conditioned on LLM-generated labels, to detect cheating.

Result: The method shows theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Peer prediction is a viable, training-free approach to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing, especially for annotation tasks.

Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of
high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the
increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a
significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be
compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often
rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for
annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate
the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information
within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate
LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our
approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning
on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on
prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical
guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We
establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically
demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world
crowdsourcing datasets.

TL;DR: Mathesis is an end-to-end theorem proving pipeline for informal problem statements, featuring an autoformalizer and prover, evaluated on real-world benchmarks with strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of LLM-based theorem provers requiring expert-written formal inputs, Mathesis aims to process natural language problems directly.

Method: Introduces Mathesis-Autoformalizer (using reinforcement learning) and Mathesis-Prover, evaluated on Gaokao-Formal and MiniF2F benchmarks.

Result: Autoformalizer outperforms baselines by 22%; full system achieves 64% accuracy on MiniF2F and 18% on Gaokao-Formal.

Conclusion: Mathesis demonstrates effective end-to-end theorem proving for natural language problems, with significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal
reasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained
by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their
applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle
this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline
processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer,
the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the
formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel
LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also
proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized
statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal
theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex
problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully
designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate
Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best
baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other
model combinations, achieving 64% accuracy on MiniF2F with pass@32 and a
state-of-the-art 18% on Gaokao-Formal.

*Liwen Zheng,Chaozhuo Li,Haoran Jia,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Structural Reasoning framework improves multi-hop fact verification by modeling reasoning paths as structured graphs, outperforming baselines on FEVER and HoVer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of static or shallow models in accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence for fact verification.

Method: Proposes a framework with structure-enhanced retrieval and reasoning-path-guided verification modules, incorporating structure-aware reasoning for long-range dependencies.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on FEVER and HoVer datasets, enhancing retrieval precision and verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Modeling reasoning paths as structured graphs effectively improves multi-hop fact verification.

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents
significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in
accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing
approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the
evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and
limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural
Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models
reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and
claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a
structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to
guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that
incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We
further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures
long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise
verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the
effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and
verification accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARCUS is a multi-agent pipeline using LLMs to clean and re-chunk the BRIGHT benchmark into BRIGHT-Plus, improving retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BRIGHT's practical effectiveness is limited by web-crawled artifacts like redundancy and semantic discontinuity, especially in StackExchange subdomains.

Method: MARCUS employs dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation to enhance corpus quality.

Result: BRIGHT-Plus shows consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across diverse retrievers.

Conclusion: The release of BRIGHT-Plus and MARCUS supports future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both
structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and
influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across
diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is
limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and
semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream
reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven
StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and
Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a
higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for
structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing
spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in
both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of
retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to
support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

TL;DR: A Python FL framework simplifies federated learning for non-professional programmers and LLMs, with ChatGPT automating CSP translation for algorithm verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the translation of federated learning algorithms into CSP processes for automated verification, reducing manual effort.

Method: Uses ChatGPT to automate Python-to-CSP translation, estimating minimal context, and validates with model checker PAT.

Result: Successfully translated and verified generic centralized and decentralized federated learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates translation, enhancing accessibility and verification efficiency.

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL
framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be
professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous
research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were
manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness
properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper,
a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to
automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in
Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality
of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The
proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful
translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and
decentralized federated learning algorithms.

*Liangliang You,Junchi Yao,Shu Yang,Guimin Hu,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses behavioral hallucinations in multimodal large language models, introducing SHE, a lightweight framework to detect and mitigate them, and a new metric (BEACH) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral hallucinations in sequential images are understudied compared to objective hallucinations, limiting model reliability.

Method: Proposes SHE, a two-stage framework: (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment with adaptive temporal windows, (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection in joint embedding space. Introduces BEACH metric.

Result: SHE reduces behavioral hallucinations by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SHE effectively addresses behavioral hallucinations, improving model reliability for sequential images.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

TL;DR: The study explores strategies for customizing a GPT agent (MyGPT) to code classroom dialogue, addressing challenges in manual coding and leveraging GPT-4's capabilities for small datasets and custom schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classroom dialogue analysis is labor-intensive and nuanced, requiring automation solutions adaptable to small datasets and custom coding schemes.

Method: Evaluates MyGPT's baseline performance with a human codebook, tests performance variations with example inputs, and identifies practical strategies for effective agent configuration.

Result: MyGPT, when configured with identified strategies, can serve as a useful coding assistant despite limitations.

Conclusion: Customized GPT agents like MyGPT offer practical solutions for dialogue researchers with limited data, though further refinements may be needed.

Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT
agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised
as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the
need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive
nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language
models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating
pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or
replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised
coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its
baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and
examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a
variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it
identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for
configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that,
despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can
serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic evaluation framework is proposed to assess MLLM generalization by perturbing tasks, revealing true model robustness beyond static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about data contamination in MLLMs risk masking true generalization, especially in reasoning tasks fine-tuned via reinforcement learning.

Method: Perturb tasks (not inputs) to evaluate models across diverse capabilities (e.g., QA, captioning) using the same visual input, with an automated pipeline for scoring.

Result: Fine-tuning on contaminated data sharpens task-specific performance but harms generalization. Task perturbation reveals reliance on superficial cues.

Conclusion: Dynamic task perturbation provides deeper insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from overfitting or data leakage.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language
benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set
exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern
extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from
potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static
benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the
same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA,
captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This
task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on
superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape
sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima)
falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter
minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring
open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption
sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks
including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task
"ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data
(extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but
harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper
insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from
spurious leakage or overfitting.

TL;DR: BIMgent is a framework using multimodal LLMs to automate 3D building modeling in BIM software, achieving a 32% success rate where baselines failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents lack specialization for complex, open-ended tasks like 3D building modeling in AEC, which BIMgent aims to address.

Method: BIMgent uses multimodal LLMs to autonomously author building models via GUI operations, handling conceptual design, workflow planning, and execution.

Result: BIMgent achieved a 32% success rate in real-world tasks, outperforming baselines (0%), and maintained reasonable design quality.

Conclusion: BIMgent reduces manual workload and preserves design intent, showing promise for practical use in architectural modeling.

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop
automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly
specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended
design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information
Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by
current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework
powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable
autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI)
operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process,
including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific
workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate
BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based
conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design.
The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its
operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to
complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent
effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent,
highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural
modeling scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-making delays in dynamically changing high-risk scenarios (e.g., fire, flood) are understudied but critical for embodied intelligence.

Method: Proposes TCM to convert inference delays into simulation frames and RRARA, combining a lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent for reactive and reflective behaviors.

Result: RRARA outperforms baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios on the HAZARD benchmark.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of latency-aware evaluation and demonstrates RRARA's effectiveness in high-risk, dynamic environments.

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models
(LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers
have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk
scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under
these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet
insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that
translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation
frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based
metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action
Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we
present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a
lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable
immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ.
Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing
baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

*Jake Tuero,Michael Buro,Levi H. S. Lelis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to learn subgoal-based policies for policy tree search, improving sample efficiency by utilizing search trees from both successful and failed attempts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy tree search algorithms require costly complete solution trajectories for training, especially for hard instances, leading to inefficient learning.

Method: The proposed method learns subgoals and subgoal-conditioned policies from expanded search trees, including failed attempts.

Result: Empirical results show improved sample efficiency in learning policies and heuristic functions.

Conclusion: The novel approach enhances training efficiency by leveraging all search attempts, reducing wasted samples.

Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to
guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of
expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of
the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in
which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the
policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search
process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be
prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized
policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve
these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning
subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and
policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search
expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of
failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training
method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic
function in this online setting.

### [239] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection of LLMs via Curriculum Preference Optimization with Synthetic Reasoning Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07390)
*Xin-Cheng Wen,Yijun Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Yang Xiao,Deheng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReVD improves LLM-based vulnerability detection by synthesizing reasoning data and optimizing vulnerability-specific preferences, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with vulnerability detection due to lack of reasoning data and focus on semantics over underlying patterns.

Method: ReVD synthesizes reasoning data via forward/backward processes and uses triplet fine-tuning with curriculum preference optimization.

Result: ReVD achieves 12.24%-22.77% accuracy improvement on PrimeVul and SVEN datasets.

Conclusion: ReVD sets a new state-of-the-art for LLM-based vulnerability detection, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous
coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software
vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two
factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which
hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and
(2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason
behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability
samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability
detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the
scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data
synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically,
we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and
corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning
data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by
curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better
understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on
PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for
LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement
in the accuracy. The source code and data are available at

*Ze Yang,Yihong Jin,Juntian Liu,Xinhe Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) combining LLM and DRL for efficient fault recovery in cloud AI systems, reducing recovery time by 37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fault detection and recovery in increasingly complex cloud-based AI systems to ensure reliability.

Method: A two-stage hybrid architecture: LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation and DRL recovery strategy optimization, enhanced by memory-guided meta-controller.

Result: IFSHM reduces system recovery time by 37% in unknown fault scenarios compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of LLM and DRL in IFSHM improves fault recovery efficiency and adaptability in cloud AI systems.

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase,
the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core
challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we
propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates
Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to
realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy
optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional
DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid
architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can
dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system
indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery
strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic
matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The
innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment
modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration
efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same
time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with
reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve
continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared
with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system
recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for solving visually presented math problems, revealing moderate precision, varied performance across topics and languages, and limited reasoning consistency among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of MLLMs in handling visually presented mathematics, including diagrams, multilingual text, and symbolic notation.

Method: Assessed models (GPT 4o, Pixtral, Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision, Gemini 2.0 Flash) using a multilingual Kangaroo-style benchmark across geometry, algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics.

Result: Key findings: moderate precision overall, limited gains without images, varied performance by language/difficulty, and Gemini/GPT 4o excelling in reasoning.

Conclusion: MLLMs show promise but lack human-level performance; Gemini and GPT 4o lead in structured reasoning, while others rely on heuristics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language
capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains
underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for
mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and
symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral,
Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual
Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our
experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate
across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single
model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy
with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance
for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating
underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation
exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier
items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably,
Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed
by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance.
Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason
or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured
reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less
consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable
to align their outputs with the given answer options.

*Yuling Wang,Zihui Chen,Pengfei Jiao,Xiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes HeTa, a foundation attack model for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), enabling generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs by mining shared vulnerability patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HGNN attacks require complex retraining for new scenarios, and foundation models offer potential for generalization. The paper explores designing a foundation attack model for HGNNs.

Method: HeTa uses a foundation surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify shared relation-aware attack units, implementing a serialized relation-by-relation attack.

Result: HeTa demonstrates powerful attack performance and generalizability across various HGNNs and heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: HeTa provides a scalable and efficient solution for attacking HGNNs, leveraging shared vulnerability patterns for generalizable perturbations.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the
need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security.
However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters
to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation
models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks
by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us
to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables
generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new
heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant
differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly
share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.
Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining
shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise
heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation
surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared
relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized
relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this
way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily
fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack
performances and generalizability of our method.

*Weijie Shi,Han Zhu,Jiaming Ji,Mengze Li,Jipeng Zhang,Ruiyuan Zhang,Jia Zhu,Jiajie Xu,Sirui Han,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LegalReasoner improves legal judgment prediction by step-wise verification and correction, enhancing reliability and accuracy in court decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for legal judgment prediction (LJP) often fail in complex legal reasoning, leading to logical errors. LegalReasoner aims to address this by ensuring reliable reasoning processes.

Method: LegalReasoner decomposes cases into dispute points, conducts step-wise reasoning, and verifies each step for correctness, progressiveness, and potential errors. Errors are corrected using expert-designed strategies.

Result: LegalReasoner improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on the LLAMA-3.1-70B model, validated using the LegalHK dataset.

Conclusion: LegalReasoner enhances LJP reliability through structured reasoning and verification, supported by the annotated LegalHK dataset.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final
rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the
judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial
efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when
conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances
LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning
process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex
cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier
to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential
perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and
resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner,
we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with
detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and
process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner
significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on
LLAMA-3.1-70B. The data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFEV is a novel framework for fact verification that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fact verification methods struggle with complex claims due to static decomposition and surface-level retrieval, leading to reasoning errors and noisy evidence.

Method: AFEV iteratively decomposes claims into atomic facts, refines understanding, reranks evidence, and uses context-specific demonstrations for reasoning.

Result: AFEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and interpretability across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AFEV addresses limitations of traditional methods by enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning, enhancing fact verification for complex claims.

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing
the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However,
traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning
over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies
and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced
structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning
errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse
claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To
address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a
novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts,
enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically
refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative
fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages
context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

TL;DR: XPM-WM uses a learned World Model to generate simulated trajectories for Cross-play Minimization, improving sample efficiency and scalability in Zero-Shot Coordination agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XPM methods are computationally expensive and sample inefficient, requiring multiple trajectory samples and training partners from scratch.

Method: Proposes XPM-WM, a framework using a learned World Model to simulate trajectories, eliminating the need for multiple samples.

Result: XPM-WM matches performance of prior methods in training rewards and partner diversity while being more efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: XPM-WM significantly enhances sample efficiency and scalability for training ZSC agents.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC)
agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative
conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population
generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the
training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each
partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of
the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task.
In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of
an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods.
We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM
via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes
the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed
method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match
the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward
as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly
more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

TL;DR: ReLIFT combines RL and SFT to enhance LLM reasoning, outperforming standalone methods with a +5.2-point improvement and requiring only 13% of demonstration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs are limited to improving existing knowledge, while SFT can incorporate new information. Combining both could overcome these limitations.

Method: Introduces ReLIFT, alternating RL and SFT: RL for maintaining performance, SFT for challenging questions, using collected high-quality solutions.

Result: ReLIFT improves performance by +5.2 points on benchmarks, outperforming RL and SFT alone, and uses only 13% of demonstration data.

Conclusion: ReLIFT effectively combines RL and SFT, overcoming RL's limitations and demonstrating scalability and superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that
sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through
reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its
current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the
limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing
knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new
information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and
reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze
the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels
at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's
original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on
questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary
strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach,
\textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved
with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily
trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality
solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates
between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT
achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five
competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to
other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both
RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data,
highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that
ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the
significant potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARIS is a hierarchical agent system for multi-hop claim verification, combining reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop claim verification requires interleaved reasoning and dynamic information retrieval, which is inherently challenging.

Method: HARIS uses a high-level reasoning agent and a low-level search agent, trained with reinforcement learning, to specialize in reasoning and information retrieval.

Result: HARIS achieves strong performance on EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks, advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Conclusion: HARIS effectively addresses the challenges of multi-hop claim verification by explicitly modeling the interplay between reasoning and search.

Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step
reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for
information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally
interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence,
while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial
information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and
Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of
reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a
high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification
chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a
low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining
its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to
specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and
interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with
outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER
benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly
advancing multi-hop claim verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic curriculum learning framework for MARL with adaptive difficulty adjustment and a counterfactual advantage function (CGRPA) to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL methods train against fixed opponent strategies, limiting adaptability and leading to suboptimal policies.

Method: Proposes a dynamic CL framework with self-adaptive difficulty adjustment and CGRPA for intrinsic credit assignment.

Result: Improves training stability and final performance, achieving competitive results.

Conclusion: The framework enhances MARL adaptability and performance in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in
cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train
agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static
difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments
and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum
learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL
that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism
continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training
performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more
challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability
due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this
challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),
which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit
signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA
constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual
contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates
throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through
constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic
rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under
non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive
results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current vision-language models (VLMs) in handling complex molecular structures and inconsistent annotations in OCSR.

Method: Proposes GTR-Mol-VLM with two key innovations: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought and a data-centric principle for faithful recognition. Uses a large-scale dataset (GTR-CoT-1.3M) and MolRec-Bench for evaluation.

Result: GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms specialist models and VLMs, especially in handling molecular images with functional group abbreviations, by ~14 percentage points.

Conclusion: This work advances OCSR technology, benefiting cheminformatics and AI for Science, with plans to release the dataset publicly.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing
chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable
formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in
this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex
molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought}
mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular
graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric
principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses
the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded
annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a
large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations,
and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained
evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist
models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in
scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations,
GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage
points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work
will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby
advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release
GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

TL;DR: SAFEFLOW is a protocol-level framework for secure, reliable, and coordinated LLM/VLM-based agents, enforcing fine-grained information flow control and robust multi-agent execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent frameworks lack mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination, making them fragile.

Method: SAFEFLOW introduces fine-grained IFC, transactional execution, conflict resolution, secure scheduling, and resilience mechanisms like write-ahead logging and rollback.

Result: Agents built with SAFEFLOW outperform state-of-the-art in reliability and security under adversarial and concurrent conditions, as validated by SAFEFLOWBENCH.

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH advance reliable autonomy by providing principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

Motivation: To address the challenge of effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis generation in clinical proteogenomics, where manual processes are time-consuming and limited.

Method: PROTEUS employs separate modules for data exploration, statistical analysis, and hypothesis proposal, using unified graph structures to manage relationships between biological entities.

Result: Applied to 10 datasets, PROTEUS generated 360 hypotheses, validated externally and scored automatically for reliability and novelty.

Conclusion: PROTEUS accelerates multiomic analysis and demonstrates the potential of autonomous systems for specialized scientific hypothesis generation.

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces
data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical
proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis
proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate
modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended

formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships
between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex
research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from
published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated
through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through

TL;DR: SWE-Dev is an open-source LLM-based SWE agent that addresses challenges in software engineering automation by synthesizing test cases and scaling training data, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases hinders the development of effective SWE agents, prompting the creation of SWE-Dev.

Method: Developed a pipeline for test case synthesis and scaled agent trajectories to build training data for SWE-Dev.

Result: SWE-Dev models (7B and 32B) achieved success rates of 23.4% and 36.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.

Conclusion: SWE-Dev demonstrates the potential of open-source LLMs in automating software engineering tasks, with publicly available resources for further development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational
problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as
software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex
and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development
process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the
lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this
issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we
develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation.
Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for
building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the
SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents.
Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models
reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source
models. All code, models, and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCPWorld is a novel testbed for evaluating API, GUI, and hybrid computer use agents (CUAs) using white-box apps, offering robust task verification and broad design flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CUA benchmarks focus on GUI agents, which are vulnerable to UI changes and ignore API interactions. MCPWorld addresses this gap by supporting API and hybrid agents.

Method: MCPWorld uses white-box apps with source code availability, enabling dynamic code instrumentation for task verification. It includes 201 annotated tasks and supports GPU acceleration.

Result: Preliminary experiments show 75.12% task completion accuracy, demonstrating the practicality of agent automation with MCP.

Conclusion: MCPWorld aims to standardize benchmarking for next-gen CUAs leveraging external tools, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative
technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA
benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are
susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by
application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose
MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid
agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those
with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g.,
adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app
features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly
monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code
instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from
specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks,
covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully
containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different
OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative
LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy,
simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of
agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate
and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that
can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available
at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a competition to design evaluation tasks for early training stages of small language models, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to provide meaningful signals for early training stages of small models, necessitating tailored evaluation methods.

Method: Participants develop or adapt benchmarks using provided pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, 3B) and intermediate checkpoints.

Result: Submissions are evaluated on signal quality, consistency of rankings, and relevance to scientific knowledge.

Conclusion: The initiative aims to make early-stage LLM research more systematic and accessible, fostering broader participation.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of
fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in
the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to
provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences
arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge
evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of
language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation
methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance
differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three
pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate
checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and
development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms,
making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational
resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality
of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1
trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge
domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early
training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from
various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or
have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to
make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the
earliest phases of model development.

TL;DR: RSafe is a reasoning-based safeguard for LLMs, using guided reasoning and reinforced alignment to protect against policy-violating content without relying on extensive human-curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guard models for LLMs struggle with out-of-distribution threats and require large human-curated datasets, prompting the need for a more adaptive solution.

Method: RSafe operates in two stages: guided reasoning (policy-driven risk analysis) and reinforced alignment (rule-based RL to optimize reasoning paths).

Result: RSafe generalizes safety protection to unseen or adversarial scenarios by internalizing safety principles.

Conclusion: RSafe offers tailored, robust safeguards for LLMs by adapting to user-specified safety policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite
deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and
society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content,
system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM
inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a
prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models
rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with
out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak
attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive
reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide
robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates
in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input
content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced
alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with
accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to
internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over
unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe
accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored
to specific safety requirements.

TL;DR: The paper explores the Semantic Spacetime graph model, focusing on its use for knowledge representation and process modeling, highlighting predictability and issues like absorbing states and division by zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the Semantic Spacetime graph model for scalable knowledge representation and process modeling, addressing challenges like information leakage and closure loss.

Method: Defines a finite γ(3,4) representation for closed operations and analyzes absorbing states and boundary information in graphs.

Result: Identifies that absorbing states cause information leakage and links division by zero to closure loss, requiring remedial input.

Conclusion: The Semantic Spacetime model, rooted in Promise Theory, clarifies boundary information and intentionality in handling absorbing states.

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with
reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process
modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed
set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The
Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to
pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any
partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is
closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of
closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic
Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such
absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality
can enter.

TL;DR: REMoH integrates NSGA-II with LLM-based heuristic generation, using reflection for diverse heuristics, achieving competitive results in FJSSP with less modeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-objective optimization struggles with adaptability and nonlinearity; LLMs offer improved explainability and reasoning.

Method: REMoH combines NSGA-II with LLM-generated heuristics, using clustering and search-space reflection for diversity and quality.

Result: Competitive performance on FJSSP benchmarks (Dauzere, Barnes, Brandimarte) with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability.

Conclusion: LLMs can augment traditional optimization, providing flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective tasks.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks.
Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive
problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability,
adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of
Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with
LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that
uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse,
high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution
diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using
three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate
that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches
with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings
underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering
greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify metacognition within the CMC framework, leveraging existing cognitive capabilities for human-like minds.

Method: Extends the CMC by reasoning over explicit representations of cognitive processes in working memory, requiring minimal structural changes.

Result: Demonstrates examples of metacognition functioning within the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates metacognition into the CMC, maintaining its structure while enhancing cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) provides an abstract characterization of
the structure and processing required by a cognitive architecture for
human-like minds. We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition
within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit
representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working
memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC,
making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within
working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Guideline Forest enhances LLM reasoning by inducing reusable guidelines from verified examples, executing them via step-wise aggregation, and outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human reasoning is flexible and adaptive, but LLMs struggle to emulate this. Existing methods lack efficiency in leveraging reusable strategies.

Method: Induces structured reasoning strategies (guidelines) from verified examples, expands them into diverse variants, and aggregates results step-wise.

Result: Outperforms baselines (CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, AFlow) on benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval).

Conclusion: Guideline Forest's multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation improve adaptability and generalization, making it effective for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior
experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to
emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference
time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both
fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured,
efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs
reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from
verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike
test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified
reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into
diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative
thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and
aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty
and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four
benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and
programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further
highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,
underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

Motivation: To dissect the internal arithmetic processes of large language models, using multi-digit addition as a probe.

Method: Combines linear probing with logit-lens inspection to trace a four-stage computational trajectory.

Result: Identifies a coherent hierarchical process: formula-structure decoding, computational feature emergence, numerical abstraction, and final content generation.

Conclusion: The model favors internal computation over memorization, with a structured, step-by-step approach to arithmetic.

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large
language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection.
Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we
propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward
pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while
the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational
features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical
abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and
decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model
organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably
occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that
favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and
data to facilitate reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data generation pipeline to create domain-specific quadruplets (image, question, thinking trace, answer) for MLLMs, addressing the lack of standardized data in specialized fields like medical ultrasound. The resulting ReMUD dataset and fine-tuned ReMUD-7B model outperform general-domain MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform in specific domains due to a lack of domain-specific data. The medical ultrasound field, for example, has abundant but unstructured data.

Method: Proposes a pipeline to generate domain-specific quadruplets from unstructured materials (e.g., PDFs, images). The ReMUD dataset is created with over 45,000 QA/VQA entries.

Result: The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, surpasses general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound tasks.

Conclusion: The ReMUD dataset and model address data scarcity in specialized domains, with resources made publicly available to encourage further research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of
domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some
specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around,
but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there
are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic
diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often
saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the
training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised
fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets
(image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A
medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000
reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound
field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and
ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD,

TL;DR: The paper proposes a temporal model extending FRBRoo to track granular, component-level versioning in legal norms, enabling precise historical reconstruction for Legal Tech and AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks lack mechanisms for granular versioning of legal norms, hindering deterministic point-in-time reconstruction needed for reliable Legal Tech and AI tools.

Method: Extends FRBRoo with specialized subclasses (TV, LV, CW, CTV, CLV) to hierarchically model temporal and linguistic variations of legal components. Uses the Brazilian Federal Constitution as a case study.

Result: Demonstrates fine-grained tracking of amendments, enabling precise retrieval of any legal text's state at a specific date.

Conclusion: The model provides a robust foundation for advanced legal information systems and AI tools, overcoming limitations of current generative models.

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their
hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational
frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal
documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular,
component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic
point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for
reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured,
temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It
introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and
Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its
linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same
paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal
Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of
individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates
new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected
components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge
graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact
assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

TL;DR: Modern LLMs show potential in addressing the Frame Problem and Symbol Grounding Problem, with closed models outperforming open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether modern LLMs can tackle historically unsolvable AI challenges like the Frame Problem and Symbol Grounding Problem.

Method: Designed benchmark tasks for each problem, tested 13 LLMs under zero-shot conditions, and scored responses on contextual reasoning, coherence, and filtering.

Result: Closed models consistently scored high, while open-source models varied due to size, quantization, and tuning differences.

Conclusion: Select modern LLMs may have the capacity to meaningfully address these theoretical challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

TL;DR: LUCIFER integrates hierarchical decision-making, RL, and LLMs to bridge the gap between human contextual insights and autonomous systems, improving exploration and decision quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid obsolescence of pre-existing knowledge in dynamic environments limits autonomous decision-making, necessitating human contextual input.

Method: Proposes LUCIFER, a framework combining hierarchical decision-making, RL, and LLMs, using LLMs as context extractors and exploration facilitators.

Result: LUCIFER outperforms flat, goal-conditioned policies, enhancing exploration efficiency and decision quality.

Conclusion: Context-driven decision-making, leveraging human knowledge, shows promise for autonomous systems.

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IneqMath, a dataset for inequality proving, and evaluates LLMs, revealing their limitations in rigorous proof construction despite decent final-answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inequality proving is a challenging task for LLMs, but existing datasets are inadequate. The paper aims to provide a better dataset and evaluation framework.

Method: Proposes an informal task formulation with two subtasks (bound estimation, relation prediction), releases the IneqMath dataset, and develops an LLM-as-judge evaluation framework.

Result: Top LLMs achieve <10% accuracy under step-wise scrutiny, a 65.5% drop from final-answer accuracy, exposing reasoning flaws. Scaling yields limited gains.

Conclusion: The findings highlight gaps in LLMs' rigorous proof abilities and suggest theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement as promising directions.

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: Gradients, a decentralized AutoML platform, uses competitive incentives to outperform centralized methods in hyperparameter optimization, achieving significant performance gains across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AutoML platforms rely on limited optimization strategies, missing viable hyperparameter configurations.

Method: Gradients transforms hyperparameter optimization into a competitive marketplace where miners compete to find optimal configurations, aligning individual exploration with collective goals.

Result: Gradients achieves an 82.8% win rate against competitors, with mean improvements of 11.8% to 42.1%, and notable gains in complex reasoning, retrieval, and diffusion tasks.

Conclusion: Competitive, economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior configurations that centralized AutoML misses.

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML
platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction
of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce
Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter
optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to
discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual
exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic
investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We
evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model
architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an
82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI,
Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\%
respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong
gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for
person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive,

### [267] [Reinforcing Multimodal Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963)
*Jixiang Hong,Yiran Zhang,Guanzhong Wang,Yi Liu,Ji-Rong Wen,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-supervised dual reward mechanism improves large multimodal models (LMMs) by reinforcing understanding and generation capabilities without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with accurate image-text alignment and unidirectional tasks, lacking solutions that address both understanding and generation.

Method: Introduces a dual reward mechanism using self-supervised learning to compute dual likelihoods from reversed input-output pairs for optimization.

Result: Enhances model performance, especially in text-to-image tasks, without external supervision.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves LMMs' bidirectional capabilities, demonstrating significant gains in benchmarks.

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

*Victor Barres,Honghua Dong,Soham Ray,Xujie Si,Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	au^2$-bench, a benchmark for conversational AI agents in dual-control environments, addressing the gap in existing single-control benchmarks. It includes a Telecom domain, task generator, user simulator, and performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks simulate single-control environments, unlike real-world scenarios where users actively participate. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose $	au^2$-bench with four components: a Telecom dual-control domain (Dec-POMDP), a compositional task generator, a reliable user simulator, and fine-grained performance analysis.

Result: Experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting challenges in guiding users.

Conclusion: $	au^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents needing effective reasoning and user guidance.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

*Penghao Wu,Shengnan Ma,Bo Wang,Jiaheng Yu,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Reflection enhances MLLMs for GUI automation by integrating self-reflection and error correction through automated training stages, improving robustness without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI models lack reflection and error recovery, relying on error-free offline data. GUI-Reflection aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes a framework with three training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline SFT, and online reflection tuning. Includes automated data pipelines, a GUI-Reflection Task Suite, and an iterative online tuning algorithm.

Result: Enables self-reflection and error correction in GUI models, improving adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: GUI-Reflection advances GUI automation by equipping agents with self-correction capabilities, with plans for public release of resources.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation frameworks for GraphRAG methods, identifying flaws like unrelated questions and biases, and proposes an unbiased framework to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for GraphRAG methods are flawed, leading to biased conclusions about performance.

Method: Proposes an unbiased evaluation framework using graph-text-grounded question generation and unbiased LLM-based answer assessment.

Result: Performance gains of 3 GraphRAG methods are found to be more moderate than previously reported.

Conclusion: The new framework highlights the need for scientific evaluations in GraphRAG research, despite potential remaining flaws.

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-enabled models require large paired speech-text data and computational resources, limiting scalability and accessibility.

Method: Leverages a unified encoder to map text and speech to a shared latent space, aligning it with an LLM's embedding space via a lightweight projection network.

Result: Achieves strong performance on speech benchmarks without speech data, comparable to models trained with multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: TESU-LLM offers an efficient, scalable approach to building speech LLMs without needing speech data.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable toxicity detection system for gaming communities using soft-prompting and LLM-assisted label transfer to handle multiple games and languages efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of scaling toxicity detection across diverse games and languages in real-time environments.

Method: Soft-prompting for multi-game handling and GPT-4o-mini-assisted label transfer for multilingual support.

Result: Achieves macro F1-scores of 32.96% to 58.88% across languages, with German surpassing English benchmarks. Reduces computational resources in production.

Conclusion: The unified approach is effective, scalable, and reduces overhead, successfully identifying toxic behavior in gaming communities.

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining LLMs and statistical analysis for detecting column relationships in unlabeled tabular data, using a KG for reference, achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing table interpretation tasks by leveraging new technologies and benchmarks, particularly for CPA tasks.

Method: Uses LLMs and statistical analysis (domain/range constraints, relation co-appearance) to reduce KG relation search space.

Result: Competitive performance on SemTab benchmark datasets, tested with various LLMs and prompting techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is effective and publicly available, matching state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAC, an LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, to improve long-term decision-making in LLMs by robust action evaluation and gradient-free policy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-term reasoning and high-level decision-making; existing methods are short-term or lack accurate outcome assessment.

Method: LAC computes Q-values via token logits for action evaluation, enhanced by trajectory rollouts, and uses gradient-free policy improvement.

Result: LAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse environments, even with smaller LLMs (7B/8B parameters).

Conclusion: Integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' knowledge advances decision-making in multi-step scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel framework combining DeBERTa-v3-base and heuristic rules to detect prompt injection attacks in LLMs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-offs in existing defense mechanisms against prompt injection attacks in LLMs by developing a generalizable and effective detection method.

Method: Integrates DeBERTa-v3-base for semantic feature extraction and heuristic rules for structural features, fusing them via a neural network for prediction.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy, recall, and F1-score, and reduces attack success rates in mainstream LLMs.

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE is an effective and generalizable solution for prompt injection detection in LLMs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on costly human annotations or external reward models, which RLSC aims to eliminate.

Method: RLSC leverages the model's own confidence as reward signals, requiring only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs.

Result: RLSC boosts accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on AMC23.

Conclusion: RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on

TL;DR: A workflow using NLP and LLMs for IoBT enhances situational awareness by enabling natural language queries and responses with graphical databases, achieving a 19.4% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve situational awareness in IoBT by transforming raw data into actionable information via natural language interactions.

Method: Uses LLMs for mapping natural language queries to Cypher database queries and summarizing results, evaluated on US Army MSA data.

Result: Llama 3.1 (8B parameters) outperforms other models, relaxing EM requirements and increasing accuracy by 19.4%.

Conclusion: The workflow enables effective natural language interactions with IoBT databases, advancing edge-based LLM deployment for critical decisions.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP is a new Direct Behavior Optimization Paradigm for Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs), improving their performance on complex tasks by optimizing discrete execution sequences using gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. It outperforms existing methods and reduces computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LwLLMs struggle with limited inference and reasoning capabilities, and existing prompt optimization methods are ineffective for them. DeBoP addresses these challenges by automating behavior optimization.

Method: DeBoP transforms complex prompt optimization into discrete, quantifiable execution sequence optimization using gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Result: DeBoP-optimized LwLLMs outperform GPT-3.5 on most tasks and reduce computational time by ~60% compared to other methods.

Conclusion: DeBoP is an effective solution for enhancing LwLLMs' performance, offering efficiency and practicality for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores safety risks in value-aligned LLMs, revealing they are more prone to harmful behavior and proposes in-context alignment methods to mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns arising from aligning LLMs with individual human values, which may correlate with harmful information.

Method: Identifies safety risks, investigates psychological principles behind challenges, and uses a dataset with safety categories to analyze correlations.

Result: Value-aligned LLMs show higher harmful behavior risks and amplify harmful outcomes due to genuine value-aligned text generation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into value alignment risks and suggests in-context alignment methods to improve safety.

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high training costs and degraded language capabilities in existing multimodal MoE models.

Method: Proposes Soft Modality-Aware Routing (SMAR) using Kullback-Leibler divergence for routing probability control.

Result: Achieves 86.6% language ability retention with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SMAR offers an efficient solution for multimodal MoE models without architecture changes.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

*Ivi Chatzi,Nina Corvelo Benz,Stratis Tsirtsis,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces canonical sampling to ensure large language models generate canonical token sequences, improving alignment with training data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate non-canonical token sequences, leading to negative consequences. The work aims to address this issue.

Method: The paper first establishes the need for generating partial canonical token sequences during autoregressive generation. It then introduces canonical sampling to enforce canonical outputs.

Result: Canonical sampling prevents non-canonical token sequences and aligns generated distributions closer to the true training data distribution.

Conclusion: Canonical sampling is a simple, effective method to improve the consistency and quality of token sequences generated by large language models.

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework evaluates LLM behavior when contextual input conflicts with parametric knowledge, revealing performance impacts and reliance patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle conflicts between contextual input and their internal knowledge, which is crucial for reliable deployment.

Method: A diagnostic framework and constructed data to elicit and analyze context-memory conflicts across tasks.

Result: Minimal impact on non-knowledge tasks; better performance when aligned; inability to suppress internal knowledge; rationales increase context reliance.

Conclusion: Highlights concerns for model evaluation validity and the need to address knowledge conflicts in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

### [283] [Improving LLM-Powered EDA Assistants with RAFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06500)
*Luyao Shi,Michael Kazda,Charles Schmitter,Hemlata Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using synthetic Q/A datasets with Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to enhance LLMs for EDA tasks, improving accuracy and performance while addressing data scarcity and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic design engineers face inefficiencies in accessing domain-specific knowledge for EDA tasks, and existing LLMs lack tailored expertise.

Method: Uses synthetic Q/A datasets for RAFT, explores Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples, and implements secure access control.

Result: RAFT with synthetic data significantly improves LLM performance for EDA tasks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses knowledge gaps and security risks in EDA, offering practical insights for synthetic data use.

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

*Kshitish Ghate,Tessa Charlesworth,Mona Diab,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how social-group biases in vision-language models (VLMs) propagate into zero-shot retrieval tasks, showing strong correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic biases. Larger models exhibit greater bias, raising concerns for AI fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and measure how intrinsic biases in VLMs propagate into downstream tasks, impacting fairness in AI systems.

Method: A controlled framework correlating intrinsic bias measures in VLM representations with extrinsic bias measures in zero-shot text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks.

Result: Substantial correlations (average ρ = 0.83 ± 0.10) between intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with larger models showing greater bias propagation. Underrepresented groups experience less robust propagation.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for bias mitigation in AI models, especially as models grow in complexity, to ensure fair outcomes for all social groups.

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

*Aladin Djuhera,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Syed Zawad,Farhan Ahmed,Heiko Ludwig,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares two open post-training datasets (Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk) using the Magpie framework, identifies structural and qualitative differences, and introduces a new curated dataset (TuluTalk) that outperforms the source datasets with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and systematic comparisons in post-training datasets for LLMs motivates this work to analyze and improve data quality.

Method: The study uses the Magpie framework to annotate samples with quality metrics, compares the datasets, and designs a new curated dataset (TuluTalk).

Result: TuluTalk, with 14% fewer samples, matches or exceeds the performance of the source datasets on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for creating effective post-training datasets and publicly release annotated datasets and TuluTalk for future research.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### [286] [Beyond Facts: Evaluating Intent Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06539)
*Yijie Hao,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Intent Hallucination in LLMs, where models partially satisfy or misinterpret complex queries, and presents FAITHQA, a benchmark to evaluate this issue. It also proposes CONSTRAINT SCORE for automatic detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to fully address complex queries, either omitting or misinterpreting parts, leading to intent hallucination. This work aims to systematically study and address this issue.

Method: The authors introduce FAITHQA, a benchmark with 20,068 problems for evaluating intent hallucination in query-only and RAG setups. They also propose CONSTRAINT SCORE, an automatic metric for detection.

Result: Evaluation shows intent hallucination is common in state-of-the-art LLMs, caused by omission or misinterpretation. CONSTRAINT SCORE aligns well with human judgment.

Conclusion: The study highlights intent hallucination as a significant issue in LLMs and provides tools (FAITHQA, CONSTRAINT SCORE) for future research and improvement.

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

### [287] [LaMP-Cap: Personalized Figure Caption Generation With Multimodal Figure Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06561)
*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng,Ting-Yao Hsu,Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan,Branislav Kveton,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Dongwon Lee,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap introduces a multimodal dataset for personalized figure caption generation, leveraging figure profiles to improve caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caption generation models lack personalization for authors' styles and domain-specific needs, especially in multimodal contexts.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal figure profiles (images, captions, and figure-mentioning paragraphs) to personalize caption generation, tested with four LLMs.

Result: Using profile information improves caption alignment with author-written ones, with images in profiles proving more helpful than text.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, outperforming text-only approaches.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

*Jacqueline He,Howard Yen,Margaret Li,Shuyue Stella Li,Zhiyuan Zeng,Weijia Shi,Yulia Tsvetkov,Danqi Chen,Pang Wei Koh,Luke Zettlemoyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Precise Information Control (PIC) to address intrinsic hallucination in language models, proposing a benchmark (PIC-Bench) and a post-training framework (PIC-LM) to improve faithfulness in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of intrinsic hallucination in language models, where generated content is plausible but unsubstantiated.

Method: Proposes PIC, a task requiring models to generate outputs grounded in verifiable claims, and introduces PIC-Bench for evaluation. A post-training framework (PIC-LM) is developed to enhance faithfulness.

Result: State-of-the-art LMs hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. PIC-LM improves F1 from 69.1% to 91.0% in the full PIC setting and enhances factual precision in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PIC-LM demonstrates the potential of precisely grounded generation, significantly reducing hallucination and improving factual accuracy.

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical QA systems lack citation generation and evaluation, limiting their practical adoption.

Method: Proposes a multi-pass retrieval-citation method and an end-to-end framework for designing and evaluating citation generation in medical tasks.

Result: Achieves superior citation precision and recall compared to baselines, with evaluation results aligning well with expert annotations.

Conclusion: The framework addresses citation challenges in medical QA, demonstrating significant improvements and practical applicability.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based medical question-answering systems lack citation
generation and evaluation capabilities, raising concerns about their adoption
in practice. In this work, we introduce \name, the first end-to-end framework
that facilitates the design and evaluation of citation generation with LLMs for
medical tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation
method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the
challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method for tokenizer transplantation in LLMs using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to reconstruct unseen token embeddings, outperforming baselines in zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers without gradient updates, addressing challenges like cross-tokenizer tasks and mismatched numerical tokenization.

Method: Approximates out-of-vocabulary tokens as sparse linear combinations of shared tokens via OMP, transferring coefficients between embedding spaces.

Result: OMP achieves best zero-shot performance on cross-tokenizer tasks (Llama→Mistral, Qwen→Llama), outperforming baselines like WECHSEL and FOCUS.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges tokenizer discrepancies, enabling applications like knowledge distillation and domain-specific adaptations, integrated into mergekit-tokensurgeon.

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

*Alan Chen,Jack Merullo,Alessandro Stolfo,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Affine mappings between residual streams of language models enable efficient feature transfer between models of different sizes, reducing training costs for components like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the similarities in representation spaces between small and large models and improve training efficiency for expensive components like SAEs.

Method: Using affine mappings to transfer SAE weights between models of varying sizes and analyzing feature-level transferability.

Result: Small and large models learn similar representation spaces, enabling 50% cheaper SAE training. Transferred probes and steering vectors recover ground truth performance. Semantic and structural features transfer differently.

Conclusion: Affine mappings reveal similarities and differences in model representations and offer a method to enhance SAE training efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

*Samuel Kim,Oghenemaro Imieye,Yunting Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) and traditional classifiers for detecting depressive language in social media, comparing zero-shot LLMs with supervised models. LLMs excel in binary classification but struggle with fine-grained tasks, while LLM-generated summary embeddings outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early intervention for mental health by accurately detecting depressive language in social media, comparing LLMs and traditional methods for classification tasks.

Method: Comparison of zero-shot LLMs and supervised classifiers (using traditional and LLM-generated embeddings) on binary depression, severity, and differential diagnosis tasks.

Result: Zero-shot LLMs generalize well for binary classification but falter in fine-grained tasks. LLM-generated summary embeddings outperform traditional embeddings in some cases.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in mental health prediction, with potential for better use of zero-shot capabilities and summarization techniques.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

*Jesse Woo,Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori,Ana Marasović,Kenneth Marino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIEFME, a dataset for evaluating language models in legal brief tasks like summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. While LLMs excel in summarization, they struggle with realistic argument completion and case retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored area of legal brief writing in Legal NLP and evaluate language models' ability to assist in legal tasks.

Method: Creation of the BRIEFME dataset with three tasks: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval, followed by analysis of model performance.

Result: LLMs perform well in summarization and guided completion but poorly in realistic argument completion and case retrieval.

Conclusion: BRIEFME aims to advance Legal NLP by highlighting gaps and encouraging development to better assist legal professionals.

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MusPsy-Dataset and MusPsy-Model to address the gap in multi-session psychological counseling research, showing improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM research in psychological counseling focuses on single-session scenarios, which don't reflect real-world multi-session processes.

Method: Constructed MusPsy-Dataset from real client profiles and developed MusPsy-Model to track progress and adapt counseling over multiple sessions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate MusPsy-Model outperforms baseline models in multi-session counseling.

Conclusion: The work advances LLM applications in psychological counseling by addressing multi-session dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeLawBench, a legal-based benchmark for evaluating LLM safety, categorizing risks into three levels. It includes 24,860 multi-choice and 1,106 open-domain QA tasks, testing 20 LLMs, with top models scoring below 80.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of definitive safety evaluation standards for LLMs by proposing a legal perspective.

Method: Developed SafeLawBench with multi-choice and open-domain QA tasks, evaluated 20 LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, and analyzed reasoning stability and refusal behavior.

Result: Top models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o scored below 80.5% accuracy; average accuracy was 68.8%. Majority voting improved performance.

Conclusion: Urges prioritizing LLM safety research, highlighting gaps even in leading models.

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores probabilistic regression with LLMs for text-to-distribution tasks, proposing a quantile regression method that outperforms traditional point estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for structured prediction lack systematic comparison and focus on point estimates, missing uncertainty quantification.

Method: A novel quantile regression approach is introduced, fine-tuning Mistral-7B with quantile heads for predictive distributions.

Result: Mistral-7B outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and calibration across three price prediction datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly Mistral-7B, excel in probabilistic regression, with quantile regression offering superior performance over point estimates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

*Chunyuan Deng,Ruidi Chang,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends learnable interventions in language models from pointwise control to distribution level, improving controllability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability to steer language model behavior by learning not just pointwise transformations but also surrounding regions of the concept subspace.

Method: Distribution-wise interventions are applied, focusing on early layers and leveraging larger standard deviations for better performance.

Result: Outperforms pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness across commonsense and arithmetic reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Distribution-wise interventions offer a more comprehensive and finer-grained control method for language models.

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained

### [298] [Dynamic and Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06704)
*Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Jingtao Zhan,Qian Dong,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), focusing on Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG to address limitations of static retrieval and in-context knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems are suboptimal for complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning and adaptive knowledge integration.

Method: The tutorial explores Dynamic RAG (adaptive retrieval during generation) and Parametric RAG (parameter-level knowledge injection).

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging areas, offering theoretical and practical insights.

Conclusion: The tutorial aims to inspire further research in RAG by addressing its current limitations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and
effectiveness. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances
in these emerging research areas. It also shares theoretical foundations and
practical insights to support and inspire further research in RAG.

### [299] [DivScore: Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text in Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06705)
*Zhihui Chen,Kai He,Yucheng Huang,Yunxiao Zhu,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework, outperforms existing methods in identifying LLM-generated text in specialized domains like medicine and law, addressing domain shift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot detectors fail in specialized domains due to domain shift, risking misinformation and authenticity concerns.

Method: Proposes DivScore, using normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation for robust detection.

Result: DivScore achieves 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0% higher recall than state-of-the-art detectors, with superior robustness in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: DivScore effectively addresses domain shift in LLM-generated text detection, offering improved performance and robustness in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

### [300] [A Survey of Retentive Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06708)
*Haiqi Yang,Zhiyuan Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetNet introduces a retention mechanism as an efficient alternative to Transformers, addressing their scalability and memory issues while maintaining parallel training and global dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face high memory costs and limited scalability due to quadratic complexity. RetNet aims to overcome these limitations with a more efficient architecture.

Method: RetNet uses a retention mechanism combining recurrence and attention-like global dependency modeling, enabling linear-time inference and parallel training.

Result: RetNet achieves robust performance in NLP, speech recognition, and time-series analysis, demonstrating cross-domain effectiveness.

Conclusion: This paper provides the first detailed survey of RetNet, highlighting its innovations, applications, challenges, and future research directions.

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

*Mikhail Salnikov,Dmitrii Korzh,Ivan Lazichny,Elvir Karimov,Artyom Iudin,Ivan Oseledets,Oleg Y. Rogov,Alexander Panchenko,Natalia Loukachevitch,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs by analyzing their interpretation of historical events from conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, China). It introduces a dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints, revealing significant biases favoring specific national narratives. Simple debiasing prompts were ineffective, and experiments showed models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and highlight geopolitical biases in LLMs, particularly how they favor certain national narratives over others, and to evaluate the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods.

Method: The study uses a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting national viewpoints. It tests LLMs' interpretations, applies debiasing prompts, and manipulates participant labels to observe bias sensitivity.

Result: Findings show significant geopolitical biases in LLMs, with limited effectiveness of simple debiasing prompts. Models were sensitive to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The work underscores national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges simple debiasing methods, and provides a framework and dataset for future research on geopolitical bias.

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

### [303] [They want to pretend not to understand: The Limits of Current LLMs in Interpreting Implicit Content of Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06775)
*Walter Paci,Alessandro Panunzi,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to interpret implicit content like presuppositions and implicatures in political discourse, despite their strong semantic and pragmatic understanding in other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to detect and explain implicit content in political discourse, an underexplored area.

Method: Used the IMPAQTS corpus of Italian political speeches with annotated implicit content, testing LLMs via multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks.

Result: All tested models performed poorly in interpreting presuppositions and implicatures.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack key pragmatic capabilities for political discourse but show potential for future improvement.

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at
https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

### [304] [Extending dependencies to the taggedPBC: Word order in transitive clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06785)
*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CoNLLU-formatted version of the taggedPBC dataset, adding dependency annotations to its existing POS tags, and validates its usefulness for typological research despite some quality concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the taggedPBC dataset with dependency annotations, enabling broader typological research and crosslinguistic insights.

Method: Transferring dependency information to the taggedPBC dataset and validating it by comparing word order data with expert typological databases.

Result: The dataset's word order information correlates with expert typological databases, demonstrating its utility for corpus-based typological research.

Conclusion: Even noisy data with sufficient annotation can yield valuable insights, and the dependency-annotated corpora are made available for further research.

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

### [305] [On the Adaptive Psychological Persuasion of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06800)
*Tianjie Ju,Yujia Chen,Hao Fei,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu,Pengzhou Cheng,Zongru Wu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' persuasion and resistance capabilities, introduces psychological strategies, and proposes an adaptive framework to improve persuasion success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate LLMs' dual capabilities in persuasion and resistance, especially in psychological rhetoric contexts, which remain unexplored.

Method: Evaluates four LLMs in adversarial dialogues, introduces eleven psychological strategies, and proposes an adaptive framework using direct preference optimization.

Result: Persuader LLMs initially use repetitive strategies with low success; explicit strategy adoption improves rates, but performance varies by context. The adaptive framework enhances success rates.

Conclusion: The adaptive method effectively enables LLMs to select optimal persuasion strategies, significantly improving success while maintaining general capabilities.

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

### [306] [Label-semantics Aware Generative Approach for Domain-Agnostic Multilabel Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06806)
*Subhendu Khatuya,Shashwat Naidu,Saptarshi Ghosh,Pawan Goyal,Niloy Ganguly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A generative model framework (LAGAMC) for multi-label text classification uses label descriptions and a dual-objective loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual document classification is challenging due to the explosion of textual data, necessitating an efficient, domain-agnostic solution.

Method: The model generates label descriptions from input text and matches them to predefined labels using a sentence transformer, with a dual-objective loss combining cross-entropy and cosine similarity.

Result: LAGAMC achieves improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in Macro-F1, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: LAGAMC is parameter-efficient and versatile, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

*James A. Michaelov,Reeka Estacio,Zhien Zhang,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models struggle to reliably distinguish possible events from improbable ones, sometimes performing worse than chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate language models' ability to differentiate between possible and improbable events, separating factors like possibility, typicality, and contextual relatedness.

Method: Tested models (Llama 3, Gemma 2, Mistral NeMo) under specific conditions, comparing their probability assignments to possible vs. improbable sentences.

Result: Models often performed worse than chance, favoring impossible sentences over merely unlikely ones.

Conclusion: Current language models lack robustness in distinguishing possible from improbable events, highlighting limitations in their reasoning.

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

*Bernardo Leite,Henrique Lopes Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy for joint control over narrative and difficulty in question generation (QG), addressing a gap in current research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QG research lacks combined control over narrative and difficulty, which is crucial for educational purposes.

Method: The paper introduces a strategy for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control in QG.

Result: Preliminary evaluation shows feasibility but inconsistent effectiveness, with identified performance conditions and trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for tailored educational QG but requires further refinement for broader effectiveness.

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse (BTPD) to address the lack of resources for analyzing political discourse in under-resourced languages like Bengali.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political discourse analysis in online spaces is vital for understanding public opinion and polarization, but research is limited for languages like Bengali due to dataset unavailability.

Method: The dataset was hand-curated from three online platforms using community-informed keyword-based retrieval, and includes an overview of topics and multilingual content.

Result: A multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse (BTPD) was created, filling a gap in resources for under-resourced languages.

Conclusion: The BTPD dataset enables future research on political discourse in Bengali and similar under-resourced languages, addressing a critical gap in social computing and computational linguistics.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse
(BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct
community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we
hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval,
this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual
content.

TL;DR: The paper examines identity-based biases in Bengali sentiment analysis models, testing multilingual and language-specific approaches. It finds biases persist despite similar content and structure, linking findings to broader AI ethics discussions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address understudied identity-based biases in low-resource contexts like Bengali, testing common recommendations (multilingual or language-specific models/datasets).

Method: Algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models (mBERT, BanglaBERT) fine-tuned with Bengali datasets, analyzing biases across gender, religion, and nationality.

Result: BSA models exhibit biases across identity categories despite similar semantic content/structure, with inconsistencies from diverse dataset sources.

Conclusion: Highlights persistent biases in low-resource settings, connecting to epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and methodological challenges in audits.

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by generating evidence-grounded explanations, improving both accuracy and response coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AudioLLMs excel in semantic tasks but lack in modeling paralinguistic cues like emotion, often treating it as a classification problem without rationale.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training to integrate emotion reasoning into multitask AudioLLMs.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show improved emotion prediction accuracy and better coherence/grounding in generated responses.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances AudioLLMs' emotion recognition by incorporating generative reasoning, offering both performance and interpretability gains.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to generate test case generators for code checking, introducing TCGBench to evaluate their performance in creating valid and targeted test cases. Results show LLMs struggle with targeted test cases, but performance improves with a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored potential of LLMs in generating test case generators for code debugging, particularly in competition-level programming.

Method: Proposes TCGBench, a benchmark with two tasks: generating valid test case generators and targeted ones to expose bugs. Evaluates LLMs' performance and uses a manually curated dataset for improvement.

Result: LLMs generate valid test case generators well but struggle with targeted ones. Performance improves with the curated dataset via prompting and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in test case generation but need improvement for targeted debugging. The curated dataset enhances their capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT), a method using persuasion knowledge to enhance disinformation detection in zero-shot classification, outperforming others by 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological studies suggest persuasion knowledge aids disinformation detection, prompting the exploration of its application in LLMs.

Method: PCoT leverages persuasion knowledge to improve disinformation detection, evaluated on novel datasets (EUDisinfo, MultiDis) and five LLMs.

Result: PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15% across five LLMs and datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Persuasion knowledge significantly strengthens zero-shot disinformation detection, as validated by PCoT's performance.

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

Result: Maintains performance on updated models across 7 base models and 12 datasets without re-tuning.

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT reduces maintenance overhead and enhances practicality of PEFT in real-world applications.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

*Jiaxing Guo,Wenjie Yang,Shengzhong Zhang,Tongshan Xu,Lun Du,Da Zheng,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the issue of reward hacking in LLMs, where correct answers are achieved via flawed reasoning. It introduces MathOlympiadEval dataset and ParaStepVerifier, a method to verify reasoning steps, improving accuracy in detecting flawed solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce correct answers with unsound reasoning, masking reward hacking. Existing methods fail to reliably detect these flaws, necessitating a better evaluation tool.

Method: The paper proposes ParaStepVerifier, a step-by-step verification method for mathematical solutions, using the MathOlympiadEval dataset with fine-grained annotations.

Result: ParaStepVerifier outperforms baselines in identifying flawed reasoning, especially in complex, multi-step problems.

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier provides a robust method for evaluating and training LLMs to ensure genuine mathematical reasoning, addressing the reward hacking issue.

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: A dynamic mixture approach combines small models and LLMs for Chinese Spelling Check, improving correction precision and fluency without fine-tuning LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM methods for Chinese Spelling Check underperform, while fine-tuned BERT models overfit. The goal is to balance precision and fluency without costly LLM fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a dynamic mixture approach integrating small models and LLMs during beam search decoding, leveraging their respective strengths.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, enhancing error correction capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances precision and fluency, avoids LLM fine-tuning, and facilitates domain adaptation.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASR models struggle with AAE features like CCR and ING-reduction, impacting WER. Systems without LMs show stronger lexical neighborhood effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ASR misrecognition of AAE features (CCR and ING-reduction) and compare LM vs. no-LM system influences.

Method: Used CORAAL, wav2vec 2.0 (with/without LM), and MFA for CCR/ING-reduction detection.

Result: Small but significant WER impact from CCR/ING; stronger lexical neighborhood effect in no-LM systems.

Conclusion: AAE features affect ASR accuracy; no-LM systems rely more on lexical neighborhood.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

computational efficiency than traditional methods. Practical applications
include real-time brand monitoring and cross-cultural discourse analysis.
Future work will focus on optimization for low-resource languages via 8-bit

TL;DR: A novel approach integrates discourse structure into text summarization for news articles, using a dataset of multi-platform summaries and the DiscoSum algorithm for structure-aware results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models lack long-term discourse structure in summarization, which is critical for reader engagement in news articles.

Method: Developed a news discourse schema and the DiscoSum algorithm, using beam search for structure-aware summarization across different social media platforms.

Result: Human and automatic evaluations show the approach maintains narrative fidelity and meets structural requirements.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses discourse structure in summarization, enhancing engagement and adaptability for news articles.

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating natural language prompt quality, analyzing 150+ studies to identify gaps and correlations, and empirically testing prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of consensus on quantifying natural language prompts in human-AI communication.

Method: Meta-analysis of 150+ prompting-related papers and blogs, proposing a 21-property framework, and empirical testing of prompt enhancements.

Result: Single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact, and instruction-tuning on enhanced prompts improves reasoning models.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging gaps in human-AI communication.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

TL;DR: BIS Reasoning 1.0 is a Japanese dataset for evaluating belief-inconsistent reasoning in LLMs, revealing biases and performance gaps in models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to handle logically valid but belief-conflicting syllogisms, addressing gaps in prior datasets.

Method: Benchmarking state-of-the-art models (GPT, Claude, Japanese LLMs) on belief-inconsistent syllogisms.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 79.54% accuracy; models show weaknesses in belief-conflicting reasoning.

Conclusion: Highlights risks in deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains where logical truth must override belief.

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for QA agents to learn to ask clarifying questions using reinforcement learning, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve QA agents by enabling them to ask clarifying questions, enhancing interaction quality.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning (RL) with offline objectives resembling reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Result: Outperforms SFT and direct preference optimization methods in rewards and language quality.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based method effectively enhances QA agents by optimizing rewards and improving question-asking capabilities.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

TL;DR: A dependently-typed framework for analyzing event telicity and culminativity, applied to English sentences, formalized in Agda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cross-linguistic framework for modeling boundedness in noun phrases and telic/culminating events in verbs, with attention to entailments.

Method: Extends intensional Martin-Löf dependent type theory, with rules and examples formalized in Agda.

Result: A framework modeling boundedness in nouns and telic/culminating events in verbs, with formalized examples.

Conclusion: The framework successfully analyzes event properties and noun boundedness, with potential for broader linguistic applications.

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs truly reason or rely on shallow patterns by testing their robustness against adversarially perturbed prompts. Findings reveal significant performance variations, highlighting fragility and the need for improved reasoning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs genuinely reason or exploit statistical patterns, and to assess their robustness under adversarial prompt perturbations.

Method: Systematic evaluation using semantically faithful but adversarially structured prompt perturbations (e.g., storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraints) on 700 code generations from LeetCode-style problems.

Result: Performance varied widely: some perturbations degraded accuracy by up to -42.1%, while others improved it by up to 35.3%, showing sensitivity to prompt dynamics.

Conclusion: Current reasoning systems are fragile and unpredictable, emphasizing the need for principled approaches to robust prompting and reasoning alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of verifying scientific claims in tables by proposing a modular reasoning approach to reduce cognitive load, outperforming GPT-4o with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific tables can mislead non-experts due to their complexity and perceived credibility, and existing models struggle with fine-grained reasoning.

Method: Introduces a skill-chaining schema using modular reasoning components (atomic skills) to reduce cognitive load and improve accuracy. Evaluated using SciAtomicBench, a cross-domain benchmark.

Result: The proposed model outperforms GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method with only 350 fine-tuning examples, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Modular reasoning reduces cognitive load and enhances claim verification, offering a scalable solution with minimal data.

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning due to lack of in-depth insights in training data. CoM aims to bridge this gap by leveraging human-like methodologies.

Method: CoM uses a prompting framework to activate systematic reasoning in LLMs through user-defined methodologies, avoiding explicit fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show CoM outperforms baselines, proving its effectiveness for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CoM demonstrates the potential of training-free prompting methods to achieve human-level reasoning by incorporating human methodological insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiMM, a multicultural multimodal metaphor dataset for Chinese and English, and proposes SEMD, a sentiment-enriched metaphor detection model, to address cultural bias in NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing, particularly in multimodal contexts, and to provide a fairer and more inclusive approach.

Method: Developed MultiMM dataset (8,461 text-image pairs) and proposed SEMD, integrating sentiment embeddings for cross-cultural metaphor detection.

Result: SEMD showed effectiveness in metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights cultural bias in NLP and contributes to more inclusive language models, with dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the overthinking phenomenon in large reasoning models (LRMs), introduces two misalignment phenomena, and proposes FoReaL-Decoding for efficient reasoning with cost-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and overthinking in LRMs by understanding token-level misalignment and improving reasoning performance.

Method: Systematic analysis of misalignment in LRMs, leading to the development of FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method with stochastic gating.

Result: FoReaL-Decoding reduces FLOPs by 30-50% and CoT length by up to 40% while maintaining 86-100% performance on math-reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding offers a simple, plug-and-play solution for efficient reasoning with controllable cost-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

TL;DR: Adversarial Paraphrasing is a training-free attack framework that humanizes AI-generated text to evade detection, outperforming simple paraphrasing and significantly reducing detection rates across various systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering by improving evasion techniques against AI text detectors.

Method: Uses an instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content, guided by an AI text detector, creating adversarial examples optimized to bypass detection.

Result: Reduces detection rates significantly (e.g., 64.49% on RADAR, 98.96% on Fast-DetectGPT) with minimal text quality degradation.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust detection strategies against sophisticated evasion techniques.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

Method: Developed ViMUL-Bench with 8k manually verified samples and a 1.2M multilingual training set, then created the ViMUL model for balanced performance across languages.

Result: ViMUL provides a better tradeoff between high- and low-resource languages for video understanding.

Conclusion: The benchmark, model, and training data aim to advance research in inclusive multilingual video LMMs.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

*Zhongze Luo,Weixuan Wan,Qizhi Zheng,Yanhong Bai,Jingyun Sun,Jian Wang,Dan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an intelligent consultation system for communication standards using fine-tuned language models and knowledge graphs, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consulting models are slow and expert-dependent, unable to keep pace with rapid technological advancements.

Method: Combines fine-tuning of large language models (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) with knowledge graph construction (13,906 entities, 13,524 relations) for intelligent QA.

Result: BLEU-4 increased from 18.8564 to 66.8993; ROUGE scores also improved. The system outperformed Llama-3-8B-Instruct and showed high query accuracy.

Conclusion: The system enhances QA effectiveness, improves interaction experience, and has strong practical application value.

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

*Stergios Chatzikyriakidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops automatic historical event extraction models using LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three enhancement strategies, evaluates them on Thucydides' texts, and translates RDF outputs into Coq for higher-order reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of historical event representations is costly, and RDF/OWL reasoners are limited in temporal and semantic analysis.

Method: Uses LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.2) with three strategies: base generation, knowledge graph enhancement, and RAG. Evaluated on Thucydides' texts and translated RDF to Coq for formal reasoning.

Result: Enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions. Base generation excels in coverage, RAG in precision. Larger models show robust performance, while Llama 3.2 varies. Coq formalization validates RAG-discovered event types.

Conclusion: The approach automates historical event extraction and enables higher-order reasoning, validating the utility of enhancement strategies and formal methods.

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lingshu, a medical-specialized Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), addressing limitations in existing medical MLLMs through comprehensive data curation, multi-stage training, and reinforcement learning. It also proposes MedEvalKit for standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical MLLMs lack coverage of non-imaging medical knowledge, are prone to hallucinations, and lack reasoning for complex scenarios. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes a data curation procedure to acquire and synthesize medical knowledge from imaging, texts, and general data. Introduces Lingshu with multi-stage training and reinforcement learning. Develops MedEvalKit for evaluation.

Result: Lingshu outperforms existing open-source multimodal models on tasks like multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation.

Conclusion: Lingshu addresses key limitations in medical MLLMs, demonstrating superior performance, and MedEvalKit provides a standardized evaluation framework.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

*Kai Xiong,Xiao Ding,Yixin Cao,Yuxiong Yan,Li Du,Yufei Zhang,Jinglong Gao,Jiaqian Liu,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Com$^2$, a benchmark for complex commonsense reasoning, addressing LLMs' limitations in handling implicit and derived knowledge. It uses causal event graphs and slow thinking to generate scenarios, showing LLMs' struggles and potential improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in simple commonsense reasoning but falter with complex, implicit knowledge. Existing benchmarks overlook this gap, which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose Com$^2$, leveraging causal event graphs and causal theory to structure complex commonsense. They use LLMs with slow thinking to synthesize examples, including a subset of detective stories.

Result: Experiments reveal LLMs' difficulties in reasoning depth and breadth, but post-training and slow thinking show promise in mitigating these issues.

Conclusion: Com$^2$ fills a critical gap in benchmarking complex commonsense reasoning, highlighting LLMs' limitations and suggesting pathways for improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

*Yuanhe Tian,Pengsen Cheng,Guoqing Jin,Lei Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based approach for multi-modal affective computing decomposes visual and textual representations into shared and modality-specific components, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unimodal or simple fusion methods fail to capture complex, conflicting evidence across modalities in affective computing.

Method: Uses pre-trained multi-modal encoders to align inputs, decomposes representations into shared and unique components, and integrates them via attention for a dynamic soft prompt in a multi-modal LLM.

Result: Outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art models in tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and hateful meme detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles multi-modal affective computing by decomposing and integrating cross-modal evidence.

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reasoning Efficiency Gap (REG) metric to assess efficiency in fine-tuned Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and proposes REO-RL, a Reinforcement Learning method to minimize REG, improving reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs produce verbose reasoning traces, leading to high inference costs and limited deployment. Existing fine-tuning methods lack consistent evaluation for efficiency gains.

Method: The authors propose REG as a unified metric and REO-RL, a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, to optimize reasoning efficiency by targeting sparse token budgets.

Result: REO-RL reduces REG by >=50% across LRMs, achieving efficiency comparable to Qwen3-4B/8B under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LRMs to align perfectly with efficiency frontiers remains challenging, but REO-RL significantly improves reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

TL;DR: ToTh is a novel framework using three parallel agents for abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning, outperforming CoT and others in benchmarks while providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning lacks logical structure and coherence, prompting the need for a more robust and interpretable method.

Method: ToTh models reasoning as collaboration among three agents, structures traces into formal graphs, and evaluates consistency using Bayesian belief propagation and NLI.

Result: ToTh outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding on symbolic and numerical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToTh offers a promising direction for robust, interpretable, and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting's effectiveness varies by task and model, with mixed results on performance, variability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nuanced effectiveness of CoT prompting for business, education, and policy leaders.

Method: Investigated CoT prompting's impact on LLMs, comparing performance, variability, and efficiency across tasks and models.

Result: CoT improves non-reasoning models slightly but increases variability and costs. For reasoning models, gains are marginal, with higher time and token usage.

Conclusion: CoT's benefits are context-dependent, requiring careful consideration of task and model type for practical use.

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in low-resource scenarios for aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) tasks.

Method: Uses structured prompt templates with LLMs for data augmentation and post-processing for semantic consistency. Introduces confidence-weighted fine-tuning for better predictions.

Result: Achieves best performance on four benchmark datasets compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances model performance in ACSA tasks by improving data quality and prediction confidence.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using posterior inference and sequential Monte Carlo to control syntactic structure in text generation, improving accuracy without losing fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enforcing target syntactic structures in text generation for clarity, consistency, and interpretability.

Method: Combines sequential Monte Carlo for posterior inference with a syntactic tagger to align tokens with desired structures.

Result: Improved syntactic accuracy (F1 score ~93) for GPT2 and Llama3-8B models without compromising fluency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances syntactic control and fluency, offering promise for applications requiring precise syntax.

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCPO, a reinforcement learning framework, to improve geometric reasoning in smaller LLMs by optimizing auxiliary construction with contextual rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometry problem solving in LLMs is challenging, and existing methods are either inefficient or computationally expensive. The paper aims to develop a cost-effective solution.

Method: Proposes Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), which uses adaptive rewards and promotes longer reasoning chains, applied in the GeometryZero model.

Result: GeometryZero outperforms baselines by 4.29% on benchmarks like Geometry3K and MathVista.

Conclusion: GCPO and GeometryZero offer an efficient, scalable approach to geometric reasoning, reducing reliance on massive LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high resource demands of training large NLP models by investigating under-explored IS techniques to reduce data redundancy and noise.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of IS methods for Automatic Text Classification (ATC), introducing noise-oriented and redundancy-aware IS solutions for large datasets and transformers.

Result: Achieved 41% training set reduction with maintained effectiveness and speedup improvements of 1.67x (up to 2.46x).

Conclusion: IS has untapped potential for scalable NLP solutions, with proposed methods demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RULE is a Reinforcement UnLearning framework for LLMs that efficiently removes specific information while preserving utility, outperforming existing methods with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about sensitive or copyrighted content in LLMs by enabling selective unlearning without retraining or utility loss.

Method: Formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem, using a small forget set and synthesized boundary queries with a verifiable reward function.

Result: Achieves superior forget quality (17.5%) and naturalness (16.3%) with only 12% forget set and 8% boundary data, maintaining general utility.

Conclusion: RULE effectively unlearns targeted information, improves output naturalness, and generalizes refusal behavior, setting a new benchmark for LLM unlearning.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing

*Wenrui Zhou,Shu Yang,Qingsong Yang,Zikun Guo,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISE, a benchmark to evaluate sycophantic behavior in Video-LLMs, addressing the lack of systematic assessment in video-language domains. It also explores key-frame selection as a mitigation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-LLMs often align with user input despite visual contradictions, undermining reliability. Current research lacks focused benchmarks for sycophancy in video-language tasks.

Method: VISE is proposed as the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in Video-LLMs, incorporating diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Key-frame selection is explored as a mitigation strategy.

Result: VISE enables fine-grained analysis of sycophantic behavior in Video-LLMs and identifies key-frame selection as a potential method to reduce sycophantic bias.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for targeted evaluation of sycophancy in Video-LLMs and suggests key-frame selection as a promising, training-free approach to mitigate bias.

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

### [345] [SDE-SQL: Enhancing Text-to-SQL Generation in Large Language Models via Self-Driven Exploration with SQL Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07245)
*Wenxuan Xie,Yaxun Dai,Wenhao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL enables LLMs to dynamically explore databases during inference, improving Text-to-SQL performance without relying on static context or in-context demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods limit LLMs to static database info, hindering autonomous data exploration.

Method: SDE-SQL uses SQL probes for dynamic database interaction, operating in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Achieves 8.02% improvement in execution accuracy on BIRD benchmark, setting a new SOTA.

Conclusion: SDE-SQL enhances LLM capabilities for Text-to-SQL, with further gains possible via supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

### [346] [Improving the Efficiency of Long Document Classification using Sentence Ranking Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07248)
*Prathamesh Kokate,Mitali Sarnaik,Manavi Khopade,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method improves efficiency in long document classification by selecting the most informative sentences, reducing input size and latency without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models like BERT face computational challenges with long documents due to fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity, and full-document classification is often redundant.

Method: Proposes a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method with fixed-count and percentage-based selection, combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.

Result: Outperforms baselines on the MahaNews LDC dataset, achieving near-identical accuracy with 50% input reduction and 43% lower latency.

Conclusion: Significant context reduction is feasible without performance loss, making the method practical for real-world long document classification.

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper adapts a bias attribution score for agglutinative languages like Filipino, revealing differences in bias themes between English and Filipino models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend bias attribution research to agglutinative languages and compare bias themes in English and non-English models.

Method: Adapted an information-theoretic bias attribution score for Filipino models and tested it on a Filipino model and three multilingual models.

Result: Filipino models exhibit bias from people, objects, and relationships, contrasting with action-heavy themes in English models.

Conclusion: Bias processing differs between English and non-English models, highlighting the need for language-specific bias analysis.

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

### [348] [Question Answering under Temporal Conflict: Evaluating and Organizing Evolving Knowledge with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07270)
*Atahan Özer,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' limitations in handling evolving knowledge and introduces benchmarks and a lightweight framework to improve temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' knowledge is static and updating it is costly or impractical, especially for volatile real-world information.

Method: Introduces two benchmarks (Temporal Wiki, Unified Clark) and a lightweight agentic framework for structured external memory.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms ICL and RAG baselines, especially for complex reasoning or conflicting facts.

Conclusion: A structured external memory approach effectively addresses LLMs' temporal knowledge limitations without re-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

*Olga Kellert,Nemika Tyagi,Muhammad Imran,Nelvin Licona-Guevara,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based tool for annotating code-switched text with Universal Dependencies, achieving high accuracy and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of syntactic analysis tools for code-switched text in low-resource settings, especially for multilingual and mixed-language input.

Method: Developed a prompt-based framework using few-shot LLM prompting and expert review, applied to Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaraní data. Released annotated datasets and conducted syntactic analysis.

Result: BiLingua Parser achieved up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, surpassing prior baselines and multilingual parsers.

Conclusion: LLMs, when guided carefully, can effectively bootstrap syntactic resources for under-resourced, code-switched environments.

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and

*Raphael Merx,Adérito José Guterres Correia,Hanna Suominen,Ekaterina Vylomova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An observational study of Tetun MT usage reveals user needs differ from existing corpora, suggesting MT systems should prioritize educational contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand real-world usage patterns of low-resource MT, addressing gaps in surveys and focus groups.

Method: Analyzed 100,000 translation requests from tetun.org, focusing on user behavior and domain diversity.

Result: Users often translate high-resource languages into Tetun for science, healthcare, and daily life, unlike news-dominated corpora.

Conclusion: MT for minority languages should prioritize educational domains, and observational studies can better guide low-resource language tech development.

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs
and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys
and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we
propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a
specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in
Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that
challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of
them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource
language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and
daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are
dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results
suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun
should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the
high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates
how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology
development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

### [351] [Exploring the Impact of Temperature on Large Language Models:Hot or Cold?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07295)
*Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Niccolo' Gentile,Geoffrey Nichil,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of sampling temperature (0-2) on LLMs of varying sizes, revealing skill-specific effects and proposing a BERT-based selector for optimal temperature. It also explores temperature effects in FP16 and quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies challenge the idea that LLMs merely memorize data, showing they understand semantics. This study aims to systematically assess how temperature affects model performance across different capabilities and model sizes.

Method: The study tests temperature effects on datasets for six capabilities using open-source models (small, medium, large). It introduces a BERT-based temperature selector and extends analysis to FP16 and quantized models.

Result: Temperature impacts model performance skill-specifically. The BERT-based selector improves small/medium model performance in SuperGLUE. Temperature effects are consistent in FP16 and quantized models, with Mutation Temperature increasing with model size.

Conclusion: Optimal temperature selection is complex and skill-dependent. The proposed BERT-based selector offers a practical solution, and temperature effects remain consistent across precision levels, with larger models tolerating higher Mutation Temperatures.

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

### [352] [Subjectivity in the Annotation of Bridging Anaphora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07297)
*Lauren Levine,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the subjectivity in annotating bridging anaphora, focusing on anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and subtype selection. It proposes a new classification system and finds low annotator agreement due to subjective interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in annotating bridging anaphora due to its subjective nature.

Method: Conducted an annotation pilot on the GUM corpus test set and developed a new bridging subtype classification system.

Result: Found low annotator agreement and under-annotation in previous resources. Moderate agreement on subtype categories.

Conclusion: Subjective interpretations significantly impact bridging annotation, highlighting challenges in achieving consistency.

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

TL;DR: ConfQA reduces LLM hallucination from 20-40% to under 5% by training models to admit uncertainty when unsure, using dampening prompts and factual statements for confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs hallucinating factual statements, aiming to improve their reliability and accuracy.

Method: Fine-tuning strategy (ConfQA) trains LLMs to admit uncertainty when incorrect, using dampening prompts and factual statements for confidence calibration. Introduces the Dual Neural Knowledge framework for selecting between internal and external knowledge.

Result: Hallucination rates drop to under 5%, with potential accuracy gains beyond 95% and reduced external retrievals by over 30%.

Conclusion: ConfQA effectively reduces hallucination and improves LLM reliability, with the Dual Neural Knowledge framework enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

*Brian Christian,Hannah Rose Kirk,Jessica A. F. Thompson,Christopher Summerfield,Tsvetomira Dumbalska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reward models in large language models, revealing biases, inconsistencies, and sensitivity to prompts, challenging their reliability as proxies for human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the interpretability and reliability of reward models, which encode human value judgments but remain understudied.

Method: Exhaustive analysis of reward models' responses across their entire vocabulary space, examining single-token responses to value-laden prompts.

Result: Found heterogeneity between models, asymmetries in scoring, sensitivity to framing, and biases toward certain identity groups.

Conclusion: Reward models may propagate biases and are not interchangeable or reliable proxies for complex human values.

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

*Anyi Wang,Dong Shu,Yifan Wang,Yunpu Ma,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRPS is a framework for enhancing LLM reasoning by manipulating internal features for role-playing, improving stability and interpretability over prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing role-playing methods rely on unstable and less interpretable prompt engineering.

Method: SRPS extracts latent representations from prompts, selects relevant features, and injects a steering vector into the model's residual stream.

Result: Improvements in accuracy, e.g., Llama3.1-8B on CSQA from 31.86% to 39.80%, and Gemma2-9B on SVAMP from 37.50% to 45.10%.

Conclusion: SRPS enhances reasoning in LLMs with better interpretability and stability than prompt-based methods.

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

*Seokil Ham,Yubin Choi,Seungju Cho,Yujin Yang,Younghun Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReFT, a model that filters harmful prompts during LLM finetuning by leveraging a refusal feature, ensuring safety-alignment and task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning-as-a-Service risks LLM safety-alignment when user data contains harmful prompts, necessitating a method to filter such data.

Method: ReFT uses a refusal feature from safety-aligned LLMs to identify harmful prompts, acting as a teacher to filter and distill alignment knowledge during finetuning.

Result: ReFT reduces harmful outputs and improves finetuning accuracy, enabling secure LLM deployment.

Conclusion: ReFT offers a practical solution for maintaining LLM safety and performance in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

TL;DR: SEED automates evidence generation for text-to-SQL tasks, improving accuracy and usability without relying on human-provided evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-SQL models depend on the BIRD dataset, which assumes user expertise and contains flawed human-generated evidence, undermining practicality.

Method: SEED analyzes database schema, descriptions, and values to automatically generate evidence, enhancing SQL generation.

Result: SEED improves accuracy in no-evidence scenarios and sometimes outperforms BIRD's human-provided evidence, boosting adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: SEED bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment, offering a scalable solution for text-to-SQL challenges.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

TL;DR: PiFi bridges the gap between large (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) by integrating a frozen LLM layer into an SLM, enhancing performance without high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of LLMs in resource-constrained environments and the limited generalization of SLMs by combining their strengths.

Method: Integrates a frozen LLM layer into an SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for specific tasks.

Result: PiFi improves performance across NLP tasks, enhances generalization to unseen domains, and transfers linguistic abilities effectively.

Conclusion: PiFi successfully balances performance and efficiency, leveraging LLM knowledge to boost SLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic
abilities.

Method: Conceptual analysis within Magri's theoretical framework, focusing on collective/concurrent interpretations and pragmatic mechanisms.

Result: The oddness arises from indirect contextual contradictions in collective/concurrent readings, suggesting broader pragmatic mechanisms than exhaustification-based accounts.

Conclusion: The study extends understanding of scalar implicature generation, highlighting limitations in current grammatical licensing theories.

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

*Feifan Song,Shaohang Wei,Wen Luo,Yuxuan Fan,Tianyu Liu,Guoyin Wang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weak-to-Strong Decoding (WSD), a framework to improve LLM alignment by using a small aligned model to draft well-aligned beginnings, followed by a base model. It avoids alignment tax and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating high-quality, aligned content with low-resource methods for LLM alignment.

Method: Proposes WSD: a small aligned model drafts aligned beginnings, a base model continues, controlled by an auto-switch mechanism. Uses GenerAlign dataset to fine-tune Pilot-3B as the draft model.

Result: WSD enhances base models, outperforming baselines without degrading downstream tasks (alignment tax).

Conclusion: WSD effectively improves alignment, avoids alignment tax, and is validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework for learning generalized text embeddings using a decoder-only LLM (Mistral-7B) with in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive hard-negative mining, achieving strong performance on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable, high-quality embedding generation method that generalizes across both IR and non-IR tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Combines in-context learning, soft supervision (using continuous relevance scores), and adaptive margin-based hard-negative mining to train context-aware embeddings.

Result: Achieves strong generalization on the MTEB benchmark (41 tasks), ranking among top models and outperforming larger or fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive sampling for scalable, high-quality embeddings.

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

TL;DR: DALTA improves topic modeling in low-resource settings by leveraging domain adaptation, outperforming existing methods in coherence, stability, and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models struggle in low-resource settings due to unstable and incoherent topic inference.

Method: Proposes DALTA, a framework with a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders, and adversarial alignment for selective knowledge transfer.

Result: DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in topic coherence, stability, and transferability.

Conclusion: DALTA effectively addresses low-resource topic modeling challenges through domain adaptation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KScope, a framework to classify LLM knowledge into five statuses and analyzes how context affects knowledge updates across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on knowledge conflicts but lacks a comprehensive way to assess LLM knowledge status.

Method: Proposes KScope, a hierarchical framework of statistical tests to classify LLM knowledge into five statuses.

Result: Findings include context narrowing knowledge gaps, feature-driven updates, and model behavior divergence.

Conclusion: Context summarization and credibility enhancements improve knowledge updates across LLMs.

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current LLM uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, identifying three flaws: low ecological validity, focus on epistemic uncertainty, and non-indicative metrics. It proposes user-centric practices for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM reliability and human-LLM collaboration by addressing shortcomings in current UQ methods.

Method: Analysis of 40 LLM UQ methods, identifying three key issues and proposing user-centric solutions.

Result: Current UQ practices are flawed for real-world use; user-centric approaches are needed.

Conclusion: Adopting a human-centered approach to LLM UQ will better serve downstream users.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCI4.0 is a large-scale bilingual dataset designed for high-quality pre-training, featuring diverse reasoning templates and rigorous data curation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for superior data quality and human-like reasoning in pre-training datasets, ensuring cleaner and more reliable training signals for LLMs.

Method: A novel pipeline for data quality justification, including two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and domain-aware fluency filtering, alongside staged CoT extraction for diverse reasoning patterns.

Result: LLMs pre-trained on CCI4.0 show consistent improvements in downstream tasks, particularly in math and code reflection, due to cleaner training signals.

Conclusion: Rigorous data curation and human-like reasoning templates are crucial for advancing LLM performance, offering insights into automating pretraining corpus processing.

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FairPO is a method for improving fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) at both summary and corpus levels by perturbing document sets and dynamically adjusting preference pair weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in MDS is vital to avoid biased summaries that mislead decision-making, such as overrepresenting negative reviews.

Method: FairPO uses preference tuning: perturbing document sets for summary-level fairness and dynamically adjusting weights for corpus-level fairness.

Result: FairPO outperforms baselines while maintaining summary quality.

Conclusion: FairPO effectively addresses fairness in MDS at both levels, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The
code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

TL;DR: GA LLM combines Genetic Algorithms and Large Language Models for structured generation tasks, improving constraint satisfaction and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of using language models alone for structured tasks by integrating evolutionary optimization for better results.

Method: Hybrid framework where outputs are treated as genes, with evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, mutation) guided by the language model.

Result: Effective in tasks like itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting, producing well-structured and requirement-satisfying outputs.

Conclusion: GA LLM outperforms standalone language models by leveraging the strengths of both genetic algorithms and language models.

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEBATE, a Chinese speech-text dataset for studying disambiguation through speech (DTS), addressing the lack of such datasets. It includes 1,001 ambiguous utterances recorded by 10 native speakers, with benchmarks showing performance gaps between machines and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disambiguation through speech (DTS) is underexplored due to a lack of high-quality datasets pairing spoken sentences with ambiguous text.

Method: The authors created DEBATE, a dataset of 1,001 ambiguous utterances recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing speech cues like pronunciation, pause, stress, and intonation. They detailed the data collection pipeline and analyzed quality.

Result: Benchmarks of three state-of-the-art models revealed significant performance gaps between machine and human understanding of spoken intent.

Conclusion: DEBATE is the first dataset of its kind, providing a foundation for similar DTS datasets across languages and cultures. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia for language technology, given the high cost of direct engagement.

Method: Conducted a nationwide survey to assess native speakers' needs and concerns.

Result: Machine translation and information retrieval are critical priorities; concerns include privacy, bias, and data transparency.

Conclusion: Clear communication and transparency are needed to support AI adoption in Indonesia's diverse language communities.

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI
adoption.

Motivation: To enhance NE correction in ASR systems by reducing noise in retrieved candidates without additional training.

Method: Extends RAGEC with synthetic denoising rationales, leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions for in-context learning.

Result: 28% relative WER reduction and improved NE hit ratio on CommonVoice and STOP datasets.

Conclusion: DeRAGEC outperforms baseline ASR and RAGEC, offering a training-free solution for NE correction.

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) to benchmark LLM-generated explanations and feature importance scores, revealing inconsistencies. It proposes a new metric and uses DPO to improve explanation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inconsistency in LLM-generated post-hoc explanations and the lack of systematic solutions due to high evaluation costs.

Method: Introduce PSCB, analyze self-consistency, propose a new metric, and fine-tune LLMs using DPO.

Result: Self-consistency scores don't differ between correct/incorrect predictions. The new metric and DPO improve explanation alignment.

Conclusion: PSCB and the proposed methods offer a scalable path to more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

TL;DR: A compression technique is proposed to reduce sequence length caused by byte-level fallbacks in subword tokenization, especially for CJK languages and emoji.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byte-level fallbacks increase sequence length for long-tail tokens in CJK languages and emoji, leading to longer computation times.

Method: Proposes a simple, lossless compression technique to address this issue.

Result: The technique reduces sequence length without losing information.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical solution to mitigate computational inefficiencies in tokenization.

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

TL;DR: SELT enhances LLM reasoning using a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with self-evaluation, improving accuracy and robustness without external rewards or task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks; SELT aims to improve performance by leveraging intrinsic self-evaluation and reducing redundancy.

Method: SELT uses a modified MCTS with Upper Confidence Bound scoring and decomposes inference into subtasks with semantic clustering.

Result: SELT outperforms baselines on benchmarks like MMLU and Seal-Tools, improving accuracy and reasoning robustness.

Conclusion: SELT is a generalizable framework for enhancing LLM reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Motivation: To explore the underexplored application of LLMs in context-aware machine translation.

Method: Literature review of existing works using prompting, fine-tuning, automatic post-editing, and translation agents.

Result: Commercial LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) outperform open-source ones (e.g., Llama), and prompt-based approaches are effective baselines.

Conclusion: Highlights gaps and suggests future directions for context-aware translation with LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application
to machine translation is relatively underexplored, especially in context-aware
settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation
with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

TL;DR: The paper explores alternatives to traditional instruction adaptation for low-resource languages, using synthetic instructions and existing multilingual models, with Basque as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large instruction datasets for low-resource languages by leveraging synthetic data and existing models.

Method: Combine target language corpora, synthetic instructions, and instruction-tuned backbone models (e.g., Llama 3.1 instruct 70B) to train robust models for Basque.

Result: Synthetic instructions and instruction-tuned backbones yield strong performance, nearly matching larger models, with human preference validation.

Conclusion: Target language corpora and instruction-tuned backbones are crucial, enabling effective adaptation for low-resource languages without extensive native data.

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolitiSky24, the first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, collected from Bluesky, focusing on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. It includes 16,044 user-target stance pairs with metadata and achieves 81% accuracy using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of user-level stance detection datasets, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky, and provide a holistic view of political stances.

Method: A pipeline combining advanced information retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to generate stance labels with rationales and text spans.

Result: The dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs with engagement metadata, interaction graphs, and user histories, achieving 81% labeling accuracy.

Conclusion: PolitiSky24 fills gaps in political stance analysis with its timeliness, open-data nature, and user-level perspective, and is publicly available.

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

*Roman Kyslyi,Yuliia Maksymiuk,Ihor Pysmennyi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to the Ukrainian Hutsul dialect, using a parallel corpus and synthetic data generation. Fine-tuned small models outperform zero-shot GPT-4o in translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting LLMs to the low-resource, morphologically complex Hutsul dialect of Ukrainian.

Method: Created a parallel corpus and dictionary, used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for synthetic data, fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA, and evaluated with multi-metric strategies.

Result: Fine-tuned small (7B) models outperformed zero-shot GPT-4o in translation tasks across all metrics.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts LLMs to low-resource dialects, with publicly released data, models, and code.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

*Harsh Bihany,Shubham Patel,Ashutosh Modi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRMA, a method replacing additive updates in LoRA with multiplicative transformations to improve efficiency in adapting large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large language models is computationally expensive, and existing methods like LoRA use additive updates, which may not fully exploit the potential of matrix transformations.

Method: LoRMA shifts from additive to multiplicative updates, addressing computational complexity and rank bottlenecks through operation re-ordering and rank inflation strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show LoRMA's effectiveness across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: LoRMA offers a more efficient and richer alternative to additive updates for adapting large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-grained annotation of teacher intents improves LLM-generated tutoring responses, enhancing pedagogical alignment and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack alignment with pedagogical strategies, limiting their effectiveness in educational applications like tutoring.

Method: Re-annotated MathDial dataset with a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents, fine-tuned an LLM, and compared it to models using the original four-category taxonomy.

Result: The fine-grained model produced more pedagogically aligned and effective responses, as shown by automatic and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Intent specificity is valuable for controlled text generation in education; annotated data and code are released for further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DOCCI-Critique benchmark evaluates factual accuracy of VLMs' paragraph captions, with VNLI-Critique model for automated fact-checking and critique. Applications include robust generalization, reliable VLM rankings, and improved caption factuality via Critic-and-Revise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack fine-grained error detection in VLM-generated captions, necessitating a benchmark with detailed annotations and tools for accurate evaluation.

Method: Developed DOCCI-Critique benchmark with human-annotated captions and VNLI-Critique model for automated factuality classification and critique generation.

Result: VNLI-Critique shows strong performance on benchmarks, reliable VLM rankings, and improves caption factuality by 46% via Critic-and-Revise.

Conclusion: The work provides essential tools and benchmarks to enhance fine-grained evaluation and improve VLM image understanding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

*Yuan Chang,Ziyue Li,Hengyuan Zhang,Yuanbo Kong,Yanru Wu,Zhijiang Guo,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreeReview is a hierarchical, bidirectional QA framework for generating thorough and efficient peer reviews, outperforming baselines in depth and reducing LLM token usage by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based peer review methods lack thoroughness and efficiency. TreeReview aims to improve this by modeling reviews as a structured QA process.

Method: TreeReview decomposes high-level review questions into fine-grained sub-questions, resolves them hierarchically, and dynamically expands questions for deeper probing.

Result: Outperforms baselines in comprehensive, in-depth reviews and reduces token usage by 80%. Evaluated on ICLR/NeurIPS benchmarks.

Conclusion: TreeReview provides expert-aligned, efficient peer reviews, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are
available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.

### [382] [Evaluating LLMs Robustness in Less Resourced Languages with Proxy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07645)
*Maciej Chrabąszcz,Katarzyna Lorenc,Karolina Seweryn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs, especially in low-resource languages like Polish, by demonstrating cheap, effective attacks using minor character alterations and a small proxy model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of safety evaluations for LLMs in low-resource languages, given their reliance on high-resource language training data.

Method: Develops character and word-level attacks using a small proxy model for word importance calculation, tested on Polish.

Result: Attacks significantly alter LLM predictions, bypassing safety mechanisms, with potential extension to other languages.

Conclusion: LLMs are vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages, necessitating broader safety evaluations and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic labels for Japanese TTS datasets using a fine-tuned ASR model and dictionary-based error correction, outperforming text/audio-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the construction of Japanese TTS datasets by automating phonemic and prosodic labeling, reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Method: Fine-tunes a pre-trained ASR model to output graphemes and labels, using dictionary prior knowledge for error correction.

Result: Outperforms text/audio-only methods in objective evaluation; TTS models trained with these labels match manual annotation quality in subjective evaluation.

Conclusion: The method effectively automates labeling for TTS datasets, achieving results comparable to manual annotations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

*Nitin Sharma,Thomas Wolfers,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deterministic pipeline for creating domain-specific benchmarks for language models, evaluates models' domain knowledge, and analyzes knowledge representation during adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in LM evaluation, specifically reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding knowledge representation during domain adaptation.

Method: A deterministic pipeline converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks using TF and Term TF-IDF methods to generate prompt-target pairs. Models are evaluated on their ability to complete these prompts.

Result: The benchmark correlates with expert-generated ones and provides a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than perplexity metrics. Findings include rapid adaptation in smaller models and mechanistic insights into layer-specific roles during adaptation.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical evaluation method for domain-specific LMs and insights into knowledge representation, aiding efficient fine-tuning and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to improve LLM mathematical reasoning by generating structured problem-solving code and datasets, validated by fine-tuning experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing LLM reasoning suffer from poor generation quality and struggle with complex problems.

Method: Extracts structural information from problem-solving code to guide data generation, creating labeled datasets with intermediate steps.

Result: Generated 39K problems and a 6.1K-problem benchmark; model performance declines with longer reasoning. Fine-tuning experiments confirm dataset effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method and dataset aim to advance LLM reasoning research, showing promise for future improvements.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits Twitch's AutoMod, finding it ineffective at flagging hateful content (up to 94% bypass) and overly reliant on slurs, while also blocking benign content (89.5%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of Twitch's automated moderation tool (AutoMod) in flagging hateful content, given the lack of research on such systems.

Method: Created streaming accounts to test AutoMod, sent 107,000 comments from 4 datasets via Twitch's APIs, and measured accuracy in flagging hateful content.

Result: AutoMod missed up to 94% of hateful messages but removed 100% when slurs were added. It also blocked 89.5% of benign content using sensitive words.

Conclusion: AutoMod has significant gaps, highlighting the need for better context understanding in moderation systems.

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GaRAGe is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to ground answers in relevant passages, featuring 2366 diverse questions and 35K annotated passages. Results show models struggle with strict grounding and deflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' ability to identify and use relevant grounding passages in RAG systems, reflecting real-world use cases.

Method: The benchmark includes 2366 diverse questions and 35K annotated passages from private and web sources. Evaluations measure grounding, deflection, and attribution accuracy.

Result: LLMs tend to over-summarize, with low scores in relevance-aware factuality (60%), deflection (31% true positive rate), and attribution F1 (58.9%). Performance drops for time-sensitive questions and sparse sources.

Conclusion: GaRAGe highlights LLMs' limitations in grounding and deflection, suggesting room for improvement in RAG systems, especially for dynamic or sparse data.

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

TL;DR: FAST is a novel training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) tailored to instruct models, improving reconstruction quality and feature interpretability compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE training methods perform poorly on instruct models, necessitating a specialized approach like FAST.

Method: FAST aligns training with instruct models' data distribution and activation patterns, enhancing SAE performance.

Result: FAST achieves lower reconstruction error (0.6468 vs. 5.1985/1.5096) and higher interpretable features (21.1% vs. 7.0%/10.2%).

Conclusion: FAST significantly improves SAE performance on instruct models and suggests new control opportunities via special token activations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

### [389] [Through the Valley: Path to Effective Long CoT Training for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07712)
*Renjie Luo,Jiaxi Li,Chen Huang,Wei Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small language models (SLMs) suffer performance degradation when trained on long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, termed Long CoT Degradation, due to error accumulation. This issue persists even with large datasets and impacts downstream tasks like reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexpected performance decline in SLMs when trained on long CoT data, despite its effectiveness for larger models.

Method: Conducted experiments on Qwen2.5, LLaMA3, and Gemma3 families, analyzing performance degradation with varying CoT dataset sizes.

Result: SLMs lose up to 75% performance with 8k long CoT examples, and some fail to recover even with 220k examples. Error accumulation is identified as the cause.

Conclusion: Long CoT training harms SLMs, challenging assumptions about its benefits. Practical guidance is provided for improving small-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

TL;DR: A modular framework for multilingual grammatical error annotation is introduced, improving upon existing tools like $	exttt{errant}$ by supporting diverse languages with consistency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GEC frameworks like $	exttt{errant}$ lack adaptability for typologically diverse languages, necessitating a standardized, multilingual solution.

Method: The approach combines a language-agnostic base with language-specific extensions, reimplementing $	exttt{errant}$ using $	exttt{stanza}$ for broader coverage.

Result: The framework is successfully applied to English, German, Czech, Korean, and Chinese, demonstrating adaptability for general and customized annotation.

Conclusion: This work enhances scalable, interpretable GEC annotation and promotes consistent multilingual evaluation, with tools available on GitHub.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

### [391] [Swiss Parliaments Corpus Re-Imagined (SPC_R): Enhanced Transcription with RAG-based Correction and Predicted BLEU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07726)
*Vincenzo Timmel,Manfred Vogel,Daniel Perruchoud,Reza Kakooee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-quality long-form Swiss Parliaments Corpus by transcribing Swiss German debates into Standard German using Whisper and refining it with GPT-4o, achieving a 6-point BLEU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-quality speech-text corpus for Swiss German parliamentary debates, addressing challenges like misrecognitions and semantic completeness.

Method: Uses Whisper Large-v3 for transcription, followed by a two-step GPT-4o correction process and data-driven filtering based on BLEU scores and GPT-4o evaluations.

Result: Produces 751 hours of quality-controlled audio-text pairs, showing a 6-point BLEU improvement over the original release.

Conclusion: Combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and filtering effectively enhances low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

### [392] [Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751)
*Silin Gao,Antoine Bosselut,Samy Bengio,Emmanuel Abbe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AbstraL, a method using reinforcement learning to enhance abstract reasoning in LLMs, mitigating performance drops from distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs often struggle with robustness in reasoning, especially under distribution shifts like numerical or nominal changes. Synthetic data generation is one solution, but this paper explores abstraction as an alternative.

Method: The approach, AbstraL, uses reinforcement learning to train LLMs on granular abstraction data, promoting abstract reasoning and connecting to symbolic tools.

Result: AbstraL significantly reduces performance degradation on GSM perturbation benchmarks compared to supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Abstraction via reinforcement learning is more effective than supervised fine-tuning for improving LLM robustness in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

### [393] [LLM Unlearning Should Be Form-Independent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07795)
*Xiaotian Ye,Mengqi Zhang,Shu Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Form-Dependent Bias in LLM unlearning, introduces a benchmark (ORT) to evaluate robustness, and proposes ROCR, a training-free method for more effective unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning methods struggle with generalizing across different expressions of the same knowledge, limiting practical use in real-world scenarios.

Method: The study identifies Form-Dependent Bias, introduces the ORT benchmark, and proposes ROCR, a method that redirects harmful concepts to harmless ones without training.

Result: Results show Form-Dependent Bias is widespread, and ROCR outperforms traditional methods in effectiveness and output quality.

Conclusion: LLM unlearning should be form-independent, and ROCR offers a promising solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

TL;DR: MultiMatch is a novel SSL algorithm combining co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling, featuring a three-fold pseudo-label weighting module for improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by unifying and improving existing techniques for better robustness and performance, especially in imbalanced settings.

Method: Combines co-training and consistency regularization with a novel three-fold pseudo-label weighting module for selecting, filtering, and weighting pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 9/10 setups across 5 NLP datasets and excels in imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best method by 3.26%.

Conclusion: MultiMatch is a robust and high-performing SSL algorithm, particularly effective for imbalanced text classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

*Zhiyu Lin,Zhengda Zhou,Zhiyuan Zhao,Tianrui Wan,Yilun Ma,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebUIBench is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in web development, focusing on four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming, WebUI-HTML Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. It addresses gaps in existing benchmarks by assessing sub-capabilities and uses 21K QA pairs from real-world websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs in web development lack assessment of sub-capabilities and focus only on outcomes. This work aims to systematically evaluate MLLMs' multidimensional abilities to enhance development efficiency.

Method: Proposed WebUIBench, a benchmark with 21K QA pairs from 0.7K real-world websites, evaluating MLLMs in four key areas. Assessed 29 mainstream MLLMs to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Result: Evaluation revealed skill characteristics and weaknesses of MLLMs in web development, providing insights for model improvement.

Conclusion: WebUIBench offers a comprehensive framework to evaluate and guide the enhancement of MLLMs' web development capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and
various weakness that models encountered during the development process.

*Yiju Guo,Wenkai Yang,Zexu Sun,Ning Ding,Zhiyuan Liu,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeaF, a two-stage framework to improve LLMs' focus on critical information by identifying and pruning confounding tokens, enhancing reasoning and generation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with attending to critical information due to spurious correlations in training data, leading to redundant reasoning and suboptimal responses.

Method: LeaF uses gradient-based comparisons to identify confounding tokens and prunes them during distillation to align attention with critical context.

Result: LeaF improves performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while reducing attention to confounding tokens.

Conclusion: LeaF enhances interpretability and reliability of LLMs by focusing on critical information and mitigating spurious correlations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

*Ke Wang,Yiming Qin,Nikolaos Dimitriadis,Alessandro Favero,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEMOIR is a scalable framework for updating language models post-hoc using a residual memory module, minimizing interference between edits and enabling generalization to rephrased queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lifelong model editing compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale, necessitating a reliable and efficient solution.

Method: MEMOIR injects knowledge via a residual memory with sample-dependent masks, confining edits to distinct memory subsets and identifying relevant edits at inference using sparse activation patterns.

Result: MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in reliability, generalization, and locality, scaling to thousands of edits with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MEMOIR provides an efficient and scalable solution for lifelong model editing, preserving core capabilities while minimizing interference and forgetting.

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

TL;DR: MiniCPM4 is an efficient LLM for end-side devices, optimized in architecture, training data, algorithms, and inference. It outperforms similar models in benchmarks and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly efficient large language model tailored for end-side devices, addressing performance and resource constraints.

Method: Innovations in model architecture (InfLLM v2), training data (UltraClean, UltraChat v2), algorithms (ModelTunnel v2, BitCPM), and inference systems (CPM.cu).

Result: MiniCPM4 outperforms similar-sized models in benchmarks, with notable speed improvements in long-sequence processing.

Conclusion: MiniCPM4 is efficient, effective, and versatile, suitable for diverse on-device applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long
sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse
applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model
context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a hybrid quantum-classical model for structured language modeling, showing improved accuracy and efficiency over classical and quantum baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum machine learning offers potential for more efficient and expressive models, especially in complex data domains like structured language modeling.

Method: QGT integrates a quantum self-attention mechanism using parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into a graph-based message-passing framework.

Result: QGT outperforms existing QNLP models, achieving 5.42% and 4.76% higher accuracy on real-world and synthetic datasets, respectively, and requires 50% fewer labeled samples.

Conclusion: QGT demonstrates the promise of graph-based QNLP techniques for scalable and efficient language understanding.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

*Paulius Rauba,Qiyao Wei,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for testing LLM output changes under interventions using frequentist hypothesis testing in a low-dimensional semantic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing LLM outputs focus on bias or fairness, not testing changes under arbitrary interventions.

Method: Introduces distribution-based perturbation analysis, constructing empirical null and alternative distributions via Monte Carlo sampling for tractable inference.

Result: The framework is model-agnostic, supports arbitrary perturbations, yields interpretable p-values, and provides effect sizes.

Conclusion: A reliable frequentist hypothesis testing framework for auditing LLMs, demonstrated through case studies.

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

*Tim Vieira,Tianyu Liu,Clemente Pasti,Yahya Emara,Brian DuSell,Benjamin LeBrun,Mario Giulianelli,Juan Luis Gastaldi,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of language models assigning probability to noncanonical token strings, proposing two methods to enforce canonicality and showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization methods in language models waste probability mass on noncanonical token strings, which never appear in training data.

Method: Two approaches: (1) canonicality by conditioning (test-time inference) and (2) canonicality by construction (model parameterization).

Result: Enforcing canonicality improves the likelihood of held-out data across models and corpora.

Conclusion: Fixing canonicality mistakes enhances model efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

Motivation: To empirically test whether diverse LLMs differ meaningfully, given assumptions about diversity mitigating homogeneity.

Method: Evaluated over 350 LLMs using two leaderboards and a resume-screening task, analyzing error correlations and influencing factors.

Result: Substantial error correlation (60% agreement when both err); larger, more accurate models show high correlation despite distinct architectures/providers.

Conclusion: Error correlation in LLMs affects tasks like hiring, highlighting risks of algorithmic monoculture.

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Motivation: To leverage vast text data for general-purpose RL without domain-specific annotations by incentivizing next-token reasoning.

Method: Reframes next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained with RL, using verifiable rewards for correct predictions.

Result: Significantly improves next-token prediction accuracy and scales well with increased compute.

Conclusion: RPT is an effective and promising paradigm for advancing language model pre-training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

*Mingyu Lu,Ethan Weinberger,Chanwoo Kim,Su-In Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CellCLIP is a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for high-content screening (HCS) data, outperforming existing models in retrieval and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in aligning perturbations with cellular effects in HCS data due to semantic differences in Cell Painting images and varied perturbation classes.

Method: Uses pre-trained image encoders with a novel channel encoding scheme and natural language encoders for perturbations.

Result: Outperforms current models in cross-modal retrieval and downstream tasks, with reduced computation time.

Conclusion: CellCLIP effectively bridges the gap between perturbations and morphological effects in HCS data.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

TL;DR: Mutual-Taught is a self-training method for LLMs that iteratively improves policy and reward models without human annotation, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts between model samples and reward model training data reduce RM efficacy, impacting policy model performance.

Method: Uses an EM-like approach: E-step updates the policy model using RM feedback; M-step updates the RM with PM outputs.

Result: The 8B policy model achieves 54.1% win rate on AlpacaEval-2; the 8B reward model matches GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Conclusion: Mutual-Taught effectively addresses distribution shifts, improving both models iteratively.

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs),
distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the
data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of
the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model
(PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training
method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring
additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the
current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal
preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing
training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update.
This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution.
Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to
consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model,
LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on
AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par
with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

*Junyi Liu,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using persistent homology and a heterogeneous network (HTGNN) to improve bank credit rating predictions when complete interbank data is unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bank credit ratings are crucial for economic stability and stakeholder decisions, but privacy concerns limit data availability, hindering traditional GNN applications.

Method: Persistent homology constructs a network capturing bank relationships, combined with a lending network to form a heterogeneous network (HTGNN) for improved predictions.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show HTGNN's effectiveness in enhancing rating predictions.

Conclusion: HTGNN aids investors and regulators in proactive risk mitigation and market interventions, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings
that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate
and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions,
and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is
often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes
persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among
banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a
heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to
improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the
effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and
regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation
of effective market interventions.The code can be find at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLProtein is a novel protein pre-training framework integrating global structural similarity and local amino acid details, outperforming existing methods in bioinformatics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in protein sequence analysis, integrating structural information (local to global) remains underexplored, offering potential for enhanced functional insights.

Method: GLProtein combines protein-masked modeling, triplet structure similarity scoring, 3D distance encoding, and substructure-based amino acid encoding.

Result: GLProtein achieves superior performance in tasks like protein-protein interaction and contact prediction.

Conclusion: GLProtein advances protein pre-training by unifying structural details, improving prediction accuracy and functional understanding.

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework, reduces inference latency in diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) by reusing intermediate computations, achieving up to 9.1x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high inference latency in dLLMs caused by their bidirectional attention mechanism, which is incompatible with traditional ARM acceleration techniques like Key-Value caching.

Method: Propose dLLM-Cache, combining long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature similarity to reuse intermediate computations efficiently.

Result: Experiments on LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B show up to 9.1x speedup, bringing dLLM inference latency close to ARM levels without compromising output quality.

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache effectively mitigates latency issues in dLLMs, making them more competitive with ARMs in inference speed while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN integrates DGCNN with Jacobi KAN for 3D point cloud classification, outperforming traditional DGCNN in accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance point cloud classification by combining DGCNN with adaptable polynomial expansions (Jacobi KAN) and avoiding deep architectures.

Method: Replaces MLP layers with Jacobi polynomial expansions in DGCNN, enabling layer-by-layer comparison and parameter efficiency.

Result: Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN outperforms linear layer-based DGCNN on ModelNet40 in accuracy and convergence, with optimal polynomial degrees not always improving performance.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise, but further study is needed on polynomial bases, degrees, and graph-based learning interactions.

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method
replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate
polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing
deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In
comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi
polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in
terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not
automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further
theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions
between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

*Bozhi Sun,Seda Tierney,Jeffrey A. Feinstein,Frederick Damen,Alison L. Marsden,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses scheduling challenges in echocardiographic exams by developing a stochastic simulation model and using reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like patient no-shows, variable arrival times, and resource constraints in hospital echo labs motivate the need for data-driven scheduling solutions.

Method: The study uses a discrete-event stochastic simulation model (SimPy) and integrates it with Gymnasium for policy optimization, comparing on-the-fly and reservation-based strategies.

Result: On-the-fly allocation outperforms reservation-based strategies, and reinforcement learning further optimizes dynamic resource allocation.

Conclusion: Data-driven, RL-based policies improve echo lab efficiency by adapting to variability and constraints, offering actionable insights for better resource management.

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant
challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient
arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource
constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these
challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of
operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and
derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on
these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using
SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a
baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to
evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which
different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a
hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2
ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation
generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient
variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic
allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the
best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their
differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency
through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

*Daniel Halpern,Evi Micha,Ariel D. Procaccia,Itai Shapira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to align AI behavior with diverse human preferences by learning a distribution over multiple reward functions, addressing the issue of minority perspectives being overshadowed by majority signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preferences vary widely, but current alignment methods assume a universal notion of desirable behavior, leading to minority perspectives being ignored.

Method: The approach learns a distribution over reward functions from pairwise preferences without annotator identifiers, treating disagreements as soft labels and ensuring pairwise calibration.

Result: The method proves that even a small ensemble can represent diverse preferences and demonstrates improved calibration, reflecting pluralistic values more faithfully.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures diverse human preferences, offering a more inclusive alignment solution.

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable
behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and
cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and
minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting
diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward
functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned
directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined
groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft
labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of
candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response
matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a
small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference
distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training
heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through
improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic
values.

*Yuanye Zhou,Zhaokun Wang,Kai Zhou,Hui Tang,Xiaofan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-PINNs improve topology optimization by eliminating manual interpolation and enabling precise boundary determination, outperforming conventional PINNs in accuracy and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which require manual interpolation and limit applicability to complex geometries. LT-PINNs address this by focusing on boundary parameterization.

Method: LT-PINNs parameterize topology boundary curves as learnable parameters and introduce specialized boundary and topology loss functions for sharp representations. Validated on PDEs like elastic and Laplace's equations.

Result: LT-PINNs reduce relative L2 errors, handle arbitrary boundary conditions, and infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, excelling in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: LT-PINNs offer a robust, boundary-focused framework for engineering optimization, outperforming density-based PINNs and demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless
tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal
topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on
density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and
limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose
Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for
boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control
variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs
eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary
determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss
function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary
representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of
LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs),
including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's
equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent
flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their
engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming
a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results
demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors
compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2)
LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a
wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries
without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.

*Kefan Song,Amir Moeini,Peng Wang,Lei Gong,Rohan Chandra,Yanjun Qi,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where LLMs exhibit RL-like behavior during inference by improving responses based on iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can implicitly perform reinforcement learning during inference without explicit training.

Method: A multi-round prompting framework (ICRL prompting) where LLMs receive iterative feedback (rewards) to improve task performance.

Result: ICRL prompting significantly outperforms baselines like Self-Refine and Reflexion across benchmarks, even when rewards are self-generated by the LLM.

Conclusion: ICRL demonstrates that LLMs can optimize for rewards during inference, offering a scalable approach for test-time compute.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving
sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that,
surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a
phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel
multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt
the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

*Zilang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarking five ensemble learners for wine-quality prediction, Gradient Boosting achieves highest accuracy, but Random Forest is recommended for cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective and labor-intensive wine-quality assessment methods necessitate an automated, reproducible solution.

Method: Employed leakage-free workflow with stratified splits, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, hyper-parameter tuning, and feature selection.

Result: Gradient Boosting led in accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 for red, 0.664 for white), with Random Forest being most cost-effective.

Conclusion: Random Forest is recommended for production; the pipeline provides a reproducible baseline for future research.

Abstract: Accurate and reproducible wine-quality assessment is critical for production
control yet remains dominated by subjective, labour-intensive tasting panels.
We present the first unified benchmark of five ensemble learners (Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on the canonical Vinho
Verde red- and white-wine datasets (1,599 and 4,898 instances, 11
physicochemical attributes). Our leakage-free workflow employs an 80:20
stratified train-test split, five-fold StratifiedGroupKFold within the training
set, per-fold standardisation, SMOTE-Tomek resampling, inverse-frequency cost
weighting, Optuna hyper-parameter search (120-200 trials per model) and a
two-stage feature-selection refit. Final scores on untouched test sets are
reported with weighted F1 as the headline metric. Gradient Boosting achieves
the highest accuracy (weighted F1 0.693 +/- 0.028 for red and 0.664 +/- 0.016
for white), followed within three percentage points by Random Forest and
XGBoost. Limiting each model to its five top-ranked variables lowers
dimensionality by 55 percent while reducing weighted F1 by only 2.6 percentage
points for red and 3.0 percentage points for white, indicating that alcohol,
volatile acidity, sulphates, free SO2 and chlorides capture most predictive
signal. Runtime profiling on an EPYC 9K84/H20 node reveals a steep efficiency
gradient: Gradient Boosting averages 12 h per five-fold study, XGBoost and
LightGBM require 2-3 h, CatBoost 1 h, and Random Forest under 50 min. We
therefore recommend Random Forest as the most cost-effective production model,
XGBoost and LightGBM as GPU-efficient alternatives, and Gradient Boosting as
the accuracy ceiling for offline benchmarking. The fully documented pipeline
and metric set provide a reproducible baseline for future work on imbalanced
multi-class wine-quality prediction.

Result: Demonstrated on fairness research datasets (COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, LendingClub), ExplainBench enables reproducible comparison of explanation methods.

Conclusion: ExplainBench advances interpretable ML by facilitating accountability and reproducible analysis of local explanations in AI systems.

Abstract: As machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains

  We demonstrate ExplainBench on datasets commonly used in fairness research,
such as COMPAS, UCI Adult Income, and LendingClub, and showcase how different
explanation methods behave under a shared experimental protocol. By enabling
reproducible, comparative analysis of local explanations, ExplainBench advances
the methodological foundations of interpretable machine learning and
facilitates accountability in real-world AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the AALpy library by adding a flexible and configurable state-merging method for passive automata learning, reducing implementation effort.

Method: Uses a common internal representation for different automaton types to generalize the red-blue framework, focusing on defining compatibility criteria and scoring.

Result: Enables easy implementation of existing and novel state-merging algorithms with minimal code, as demonstrated by existing literature examples.

Conclusion: AALpy's new feature significantly simplifies the development of state-merging algorithms, benefiting both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: AALpy is a well-established open-source automata learning library written in
Python with a focus on active learning of systems with IO behavior. It provides
a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms for different automaton types
ranging from fully deterministic to probabilistic automata. In this work, we
present the recent addition of a generalized implementation of an important
method from the domain of passive automata learning: state-merging in the
red-blue framework. Using a common internal representation for different
automaton types allows for a general and highly configurable implementation of
the red-blue framework. We describe how to define and execute state-merging
algorithms using AALpy, which reduces the implementation effort for
state-merging algorithms mainly to the definition of compatibility criteria and
scoring. This aids the implementation of both existing and novel algorithms. In
particular, defining some existing state-merging algorithms from the literature
with AALpy only takes a few lines of code.

*Ali Murad,Bo Hui,Wei-Shinn Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel FL framework uses DRL to optimize local data usage, improving performance while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance drop in FL due to non-IID data by avoiding unnecessary data sharing.

Method: DRL agent selects optimized data amounts for local training, using loss changes as rewards.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets and FL frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances FL client performance by optimizing local data usage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed framework for collaborative model
training over large-scale distributed data, enabling higher performance while
maintaining client data privacy. However, the nature of model aggregation at
the centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of
non-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally
on more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all
clients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data
necessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the
server. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent
utilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize
the amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.
Specifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the
local performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for
each class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local
training. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized
partition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the
client utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its
performance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of
aggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL
clients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple
benchmark datasets and FL frameworks. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI, especially foundation models like Transformers and LLMs, can address limitations of traditional machine learning in energy management by improving generalization, situational awareness, and data integration.

Method: The paper synthesizes recent advancements in AI for energy, examining architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations, and practical implementations of Transformers and LLMs.

Result: Transformers and LLMs enhance forecasting, grid management, and decision-making in energy systems, while the Agentic Digital Twin concept integrates LLMs for autonomous energy management.

Conclusion: Generative AI, particularly Transformers and LLMs, is transforming energy management, with the Agentic Digital Twin representing a next-step in autonomous, proactive systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management
in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective
decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable
results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with
generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration.
Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling
complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data
fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In
this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the
energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural
foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of
transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We
then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning
for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new
challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical
implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly
expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend:
Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in
high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and
grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these
developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a
next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and
social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

TL;DR: This survey reviews synthetic data generation for extreme events, addressing challenges like data scarcity and proposing tailored evaluation metrics and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme events are rare but catastrophic, and accurate prediction is hindered by scarce data. Synthetic data generation offers a solution, but existing surveys lack focus on extreme events.

Method: The paper systematically reviews generative modeling techniques, large language models, and introduces a tailored evaluation framework with specialized metrics.

Result: It summarizes benchmark datasets, evaluates metrics for extremeness, and identifies key application domains and underexplored areas.

Conclusion: The survey provides actionable guidance for model evaluation and outlines open challenges to advance synthetic rare-event research.

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are
rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across
interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize
losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful
capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data,
yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing
surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than
extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first
overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically
review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly
those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and
sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize
benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering
statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central
contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in
extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for
model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and
identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes,
windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges,
providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the impact of positional encodings on transformer models, addressing gaps in theory and practical performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis using function approximation and Rademacher complexity, proposing new encodings based on orthogonal functions (e.g., wavelets, Legendre polynomials), and experimental evaluation on synthetic tasks.

Result: Orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal encodings in generalization and extrapolation.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical framework and practical insights for designing positional encodings in transformers, benefiting NLP, CV, and other applications.

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling
processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a
theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods,
including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention
with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness,
generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness
is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established
using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal
functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The
extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed,
extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context.
Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that
orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal
encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical
gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural
language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

*Paul Fogel,Christophe Geissler,George Luta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoxNTF, a novel method using non-negative tensor factorization, improves survival analysis by integrating survival information into latent factor representations, outperforming traditional methods like NMF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NMF lack survival information integration, limiting predictive power in survival analysis.

Method: CoxNTF uses non-negative tensor factorization guided by survival probabilities from the Coxnet model to create interpretable latent representations.

Result: CoxNTF matches Coxnet's prediction performance while offering structured clustering and handling feature redundancy.

Conclusion: CoxNTF is a powerful tool for joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis, enhancing interpretability and performance.

Abstract: The interpretation of the results of survival analysis often benefits from
latent factor representations of baseline covariates. However, existing
methods, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), do not incorporate
survival information, limiting their predictive power. We present CoxNTF, a
novel approach that uses non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) to derive
meaningful latent representations that are closely associated with survival
outcomes. CoxNTF constructs a weighted covariate tensor in which survival
probabilities derived from the Coxnet model are used to guide the tensorization
process. Our results show that CoxNTF achieves survival prediction performance
comparable to using Coxnet with the original covariates, while providing a
structured and interpretable clustering framework. In addition, the new
approach effectively handles feature redundancy, making it a powerful tool for
joint clustering and prediction in survival analysis.

*Junming Wang,Yi Shi*

TL;DR: NeurNCD is a novel framework for discovering new classes in open-world settings using an Embedding-NeRF model and KL divergence, outperforming traditional methods without dense labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explicit representations for novel class discovery are limited by discreteness, noise, and holes, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: NeurNCD combines Embedding-NeRF with KL divergence, integrating feature query, modulation, and clustering for efficient feature augmentation and information exchange.

Result: The framework achieves superior segmentation performance on NYUv2 and Replica datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NeurNCD offers a versatile, data-efficient solution for novel class discovery, eliminating reliance on dense labeled datasets or human supervision.

Abstract: Discovering novel classes in open-world settings is crucial for real-world
applications. Traditional explicit representations, such as object descriptors
or 3D segmentation maps, are constrained by their discrete, hole-prone, and
noisy nature, which hinders accurate novel class discovery. To address these
challenges, we introduce NeurNCD, the first versatile and data-efficient
framework for novel class discovery that employs the meticulously designed
Embedding-NeRF model combined with KL divergence as a substitute for
traditional explicit 3D segmentation maps to aggregate semantic embedding and
entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

*Luis Pinto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intermediate-layer embeddings in molecular encoders outperform final-layer ones, boosting ADMET property prediction by up to 28.6% (fixed) and 40.8% (finetuned), with a correlation enabling efficient layer selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the convention of using only final-layer embeddings in molecular encoders, as it may discard valuable information.

Method: Conduct a layer-wise analysis of five molecular encoders across 22 ADMET tasks, comparing fixed and finetuned embeddings.

Result: Intermediate layers consistently outperform final layers, with fixed embeddings improving performance by 5.4% on average (up to 28.6%) and finetuned embeddings by 8.5% (up to 40.8%).

Conclusion: Exploring full representational depth of encoders enhances performance and efficiency, supported by an evaluate-then-finetune approach.

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

### [425] [Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety Assurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06444)
*Ruizhong Qiu,Gaotang Li,Tianxin Wei,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm for LLM safety assurance, addressing inefficiencies in conventional methods and proposing a multifurcation reward model (MRM) to reduce computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety assurance methods are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, and inference scaling, despite advancing reasoning, lacks exploration in safety contexts.

Method: Proposes SAFFRON with a multifurcation reward model (MRM), partial supervision training, conservative exploration constraints, and Trie-based caching.

Result: SAFFRON outperforms conventional inference scaling and basic methods like Best-of-N Sampling, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SAFFRON effectively addresses the exploration-efficiency dilemma in LLM safety, with released resources (Saffron-1, Safety4M) to aid future research.

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are

TL;DR: DeepEDM integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep learning for improved time series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for time series forecasting often lack explicit modeling of underlying dynamics, limiting prediction accuracy.

Method: DeepEDM combines empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and deep neural networks, learning latent spaces from time-delayed embeddings and using kernel regression to approximate dynamics.

Result: DeepEDM is robust to noise and achieves superior forecasting accuracy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DeepEDM effectively bridges the gap between dynamical systems modeling and deep learning, offering enhanced forecasting performance.

Abstract: Real-world time series are often governed by complex nonlinear dynamics.
Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future
prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series
forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical
dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel
deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs
kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging
efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate
prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as
well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is
robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting
accuracy. Our code is available at: https://abrarmajeedi.github.io/deep_edm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability in ML is crucial for scientific and high-stakes domains, but conflicting explanations from diverse algorithms necessitate consensus strategies.

Method: Six ML models were trained on synthetic datasets with known ground truths, using various interpretability techniques. Consensus was generated via established methods and WISCA, which integrates class probability and normalized attributions.

Result: WISCA consistently aligned with the most reliable individual interpretability method, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Robust consensus strategies, like WISCA, enhance the reliability of ML model explanations.

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML)
models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes
domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield
conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize
results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets
with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability
techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and
a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which
integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently
aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of
robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

### [428] [Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459)
*Ruitao Chen,Mozhang Guo,Jinge Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based intelligent cruise control framework to enhance infant sleep quality in automated driving by optimizing driving behavior using wearable sensing and vehicle data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of automated driving (AD) on infant sleep is understudied, with sudden maneuvers disrupting sleep and affecting passenger comfort. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework integrates LSTM and transformer-based neural networks with RL to model driving behavior's impact on infant sleep. It uses wearable sensors, vehicle data, and map data to dynamically adjust driving aggressiveness.

Result: Simulations show the solution significantly improves infant sleep quality while maintaining travel efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based framework effectively balances occupant comfort and travel efficiency, enhancing infant sleep quality in automated driving scenarios.

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving
comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep,
is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp
maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and
parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the
integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving
behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In
particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to
varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively
synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the
relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse
traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the
wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data
from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving
aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control
strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and
overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution
significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while
preserving desirable travel efficiency.

considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as
series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying
conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level,
offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this
gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level.
TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of

*Umit Yigit Basaran,Sk Miraj Ahmed,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Basak Guler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A certified unlearning framework is proposed for data removal without needing the original training data, using a surrogate dataset and noise scaling based on statistical distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of unlearning private or copyrighted data when the original training dataset is unavailable.

Method: Utilizes a surrogate dataset approximating source data properties, with noise scaling based on statistical distance. Theoretical bounds and practical noise calibration are introduced.

Result: Effective and reliable data removal with strong privacy guarantees while maintaining model utility, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for certified unlearning in privacy-sensitive settings, even without original data access.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of data privacy regulations, the ability to erase
private or copyrighted information from trained models has become a crucial
requirement. Traditional unlearning methods often assume access to the complete
training dataset, which is unrealistic in scenarios where the source data is no
longer available. To address this challenge, we propose a certified unlearning
framework that enables effective data removal \final{without access to the
original training data samples}. Our approach utilizes a surrogate dataset that
approximates the statistical properties of the source data, allowing for
controlled noise scaling based on the statistical distance between the two.
\updated{While our theoretical guarantees assume knowledge of the exact
statistical distance, practical implementations typically approximate this
distance, resulting in potentially weaker but still meaningful privacy
guarantees.} This ensures strong guarantees on the model's behavior
post-unlearning while maintaining its overall utility. We establish theoretical
bounds, introduce practical noise calibration techniques, and validate our
method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our approach in
privacy-sensitive settings.

*Pratiksha Thaker,Neil Kale,Zhiwei Steven Wu,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines membership inference attacks under extreme distribution shift, showing shadow model attacks fail while quantile regression performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of shadow model attacks when the adversary lacks access to a matching background data distribution.

Method: Compare shadow model attacks with quantile regression in a class dropout setting.

Result: Quantile regression outperforms shadow models, achieving higher TPR on unseen classes (e.g., 11x on CIFAR-100) and nontrivial TPR on ImageNet with 90% class removal.

Conclusion: Quantile regression is a promising alternative to shadow model attacks in extreme distribution shift scenarios, with theoretical insights provided.

Abstract: Shadow model attacks are the state-of-the-art approach for membership
inference attacks on machine learning models. However, these attacks typically
assume an adversary has access to a background (nonmember) data distribution
that matches the distribution the target model was trained on. We initiate a
study of membership inference attacks where the adversary or auditor cannot
access an entire subclass from the distribution -- a more extreme but realistic
version of distribution shift than has been studied previously. In this
setting, we first show that the performance of shadow model attacks degrades
catastrophically, and then demonstrate the promise of another approach,
quantile regression, that does not have the same limitations. We show that
quantile regression attacks consistently outperform shadow model attacks in the
class dropout setting -- for example, quantile regression attacks achieve up to
11$\times$ the TPR of shadow models on the unseen class on CIFAR-100, and
achieve nontrivial TPR on ImageNet even with 90% of training classes removed.
We also provide a theoretical model that illustrates the potential and
limitations of this approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), a framework to describe feature learning dynamics in two-layer neural networks trained from small initialization, unifying and extending prior analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how and what features neural networks learn remains an open question, motivating the development of AGF to analyze training dynamics.

Method: AGF models feature learning as an alternating two-step process: maximizing utility over dormant neurons and minimizing cost over active ones, matching experimental observations.

Result: AGF accurately predicts the order, timing, and magnitude of feature acquisition, unifying prior analyses and revealing Fourier feature learning in quadratic networks.

Conclusion: AGF provides a promising approach to understanding feature learning in neural networks, validated across architectures and tasks.

Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In
this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic
framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks
trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in
this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus
where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons
rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step
process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a
cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each
round, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and
a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these
drops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and
extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks
and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular
modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we
prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.
Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give
the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that
networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.
Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning
in neural networks.

TL;DR: SPARQ introduces a method for generating diverse and high-quality synthetic math problems using a single model, improving model performance by up to 24%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for synthetic data generation limit scalability in complex domains, prompting the need for a more scalable and diverse approach.

Method: SPARQ uses quality-diversity algorithms to generate synthetic problem-solution pairs, measuring problem difficulty via solve-rate.

Result: Generated 20M+ problem-solution pairs from 7.5K seeds, with filtered data improving model performance by 24%. Higher quality aids in-distribution performance, while diversity enhances OOD generalization.

Conclusion: SPARQ demonstrates the effectiveness of synthetic data generation for model improvement, with quality and diversity playing distinct roles in generalization.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a
powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most
methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use
natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality.
This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse
problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem
Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for
generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs
using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for
problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate
over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the
generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the
resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally,
we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality
and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured
by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further,
while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit
in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more
robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data
scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit
downstream model generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper narrows the gap in continual linear regression by using regularization schemes, achieving near-optimal and optimal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between lower and upper bounds in continual learning theory for linear regression under random task orderings.

Method: Uses explicit isotropic ℓ2 regularization and implicit regularization via finite step budgets, reducing to SGD on surrogate losses.

Result: Achieves near-optimal rate of O(log k / k) and optimal rate of O(1/k) with increasing regularization.

Conclusion: Increasing regularization strength or reducing steps per task improves worst-case performance.

Abstract: We study realizable continual linear regression under random task orderings,
a common setting for developing continual learning theory. In this setup, the
worst-case expected loss after $k$ learning iterations admits a lower bound of
$\Omega(1/k)$. However, prior work using an unregularized scheme has only
established an upper bound of $O(1/k^{1/4})$, leaving a significant gap. Our
paper proves that this gap can be narrowed, or even closed, using two
frequently used regularization schemes: (1) explicit isotropic $\ell_2$
regularization, and (2) implicit regularization via finite step budgets. We
show that these approaches, which are used in practice to mitigate forgetting,
reduce to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on carefully defined surrogate
losses. Through this lens, we identify a fixed regularization strength that
yields a near-optimal rate of $O(\log k / k)$. Moreover, formalizing and
analyzing a generalized variant of SGD for time-varying functions, we derive an
increasing regularization strength schedule that provably achieves an optimal
rate of $O(1/k)$. This suggests that schedules that increase the regularization
coefficient or decrease the number of steps per task are beneficial, at least
in the worst case.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs, introducing the MVP algorithm with a variance-aware bound and proving its necessity via a lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of regret bounds in episodic MDPs by incorporating variance-awareness and suboptimality gaps.

Method: Uses the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm, analyzing its regret bound through a weighted sum of suboptimality gaps and variance terms.

Result: Achieves a variance-aware gap-dependent regret bound and establishes a matching lower bound, showing the necessity of variance dependence.

Conclusion: The MVP algorithm's analysis provides insights into variance-aware regret bounds, adaptable to other algorithms, with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the gap-dependent regret bounds for episodic MDPs. We show that
the Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP) algorithm achieves a variance-aware
gap-dependent regret bound of $$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0}
\frac{H^2 \log K \land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}
+\sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)=0}\frac{ H^2 \land
\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_{\mathrm{min}}} + SAH^4 (S \lor H)
\right) \log K\right),$$ where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number
of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
Here, $\Delta_h(s,a) =V_h^* (a) - Q_h^* (s, a)$ represents the suboptimality
gap and $\Delta_{\mathrm{min}} := \min_{\Delta_h (s,a) > 0} \Delta_h(s,a)$. The
term $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ denotes the maximum conditional total
variance, calculated as the maximum over all $(\pi, h, s)$ tuples of the
expected total variance under policy $\pi$ conditioned on trajectories visiting
state $s$ at step $h$. $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$ characterizes the
maximum randomness encountered when learning any $(h, s)$ pair. Our result
stems from a novel analysis of the weighted sum of the suboptimality gap and
can be potentially adapted for other algorithms. To complement the study, we
establish a lower bound of $$\Omega \left( \sum_{\Delta_h(s,a)>0} \frac{H^2
\land \mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}}{\Delta_h(s,a)}\cdot \log K\right),$$
demonstrating the necessity of dependence on $\mathtt{Var}_{\max}^{\text{c}}$
even when the maximum unconditional total variance (without conditioning on
$(h, s)$) approaches zero.

### [437] [Hierarchical and Collaborative LLM-Based Control for Multi-UAV Motion and Communication in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06532)
*Zijiang Yan,Hao Zhou,Jianhua Pei,Hina Tabassum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical and collaborative method using large language models (LLMs) for joint motion and communication control of UAVs in aerial highways, outperforming baselines in system rewards, costs, and collision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of controlling and optimizing multi-UAV systems in dynamic, constrained environments, particularly in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical LLM-based framework: one LLM on HAPS for access control and another onboard each UAV for motion planning.

Result: Achieves higher system rewards, lower costs, and reduced collision rates compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach shows promise for next-generation 3D aerial highway systems.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various
real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV
systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained
environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of
multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial
networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we
consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate,
and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow.
Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and
collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an
LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard
each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework
leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both
high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This
knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of
next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system
rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates
compared to baseline approaches.

*Atefeh Gilani,Naima Tasnim,Lalitha Sankar,Oliver Kosut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoClip is a geometry-aware framework for DP-SGD that improves privacy-utility trade-offs by clipping gradients in a transformed basis aligned with gradient distribution geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD's performance depends heavily on gradient clipping thresholds, but existing adaptive methods ignore gradient coordinate correlations. GeoClip addresses this gap.

Method: GeoClip clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis, adaptively estimated using noisy gradients without extra privacy cost. It provides convergence guarantees and an optimal transformation solution.

Result: GeoClip outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods on tabular and image datasets under the same privacy budget.

Conclusion: GeoClip enhances DP-SGD by leveraging gradient geometry, offering better utility without additional privacy costs.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most
widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy
guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient
clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy
and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting
this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system
and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We
propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients
in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.
GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released
noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence
guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal
transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the
probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and
image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing
adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

*Long Dang,Thushari Hapuarachchi,Kaiqi Xiong,Yi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an SDN-based system (FDDMS) to detect and mitigate false data injection attacks in in-vehicle networks using LSTM and adversarial attack countermeasures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Securing ECU communication in vehicles is critical for safety; CAN protocol vulnerabilities necessitate robust detection and mitigation systems.

Method: Uses SDN and LSTM to model attacks, detect false data, and mitigate via dynamic flow rule updates. Evaluates robustness with adversarial attacks.

Result: FDDMS effectively detects and mitigates attacks in real-time, showing robustness against adversarial threats.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances in-vehicle network security, proving practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the development of autonomous and connected vehicles advances, the
complexity of modern vehicles increases, with numerous Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) integrated into the system. In an in-vehicle network, these ECUs
communicate with one another using an standard protocol called Controller Area
Network (CAN). Securing communication among ECUs plays a vital role in
maintaining the safety and security of the vehicle. This paper proposes a
robust SDN-based False Data Detection and Mitigation System (FDDMS) for
in-vehicle networks. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), FDDMS is designed to monitor and detect false data injection
attacks in real-time. Specifically, we focus on brake-related ECUs within an
SDN-enabled in-vehicle network. First, we decode raw CAN data to create an
attack model that illustrates how false data can be injected into the system.
Then, FDDMS, incorporating a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based detection
model, is used to identify false data injection attacks. We further propose an
effective variant of DeepFool attack to evaluate the model's robustness. To
countermeasure the impacts of four adversarial attacks including Fast gradient
descent method, Basic iterative method, DeepFool, and the DeepFool variant, we
further enhance a re-training technique method with a threshold based selection
strategy. Finally, a mitigation scheme is implemented to redirect attack
traffic by dynamically updating flow rules through SDN. Our experimental
results show that the proposed FDDMS is robust against adversarial attacks and
effectively detects and mitigates false data injection attacks in real-time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) train 600x faster than traditional optimizers by using random feature-based parameter construction, maintaining accuracy and physical invariances like permutation, rotation, and translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of slow training in graph neural networks for dynamical systems while preserving physical symmetries and constraints.

Method: Replacing iterative gradient-based optimization with random feature-based parameter construction in Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN).

Result: HGN achieves comparable accuracy, generalizes to larger systems (up to 4096 nodes) without retraining, and retains physical invariances.

Conclusion: The work challenges the reliance on iterative gradient-descent methods for training neural networks in physical systems, offering a faster alternative.

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints
remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical
laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex
N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However,
training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization
algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training,
especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different
optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained
up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative
optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust
performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring systems in up
to 3 dimensions with different geometries, while retaining essential physical
invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. We reveal
that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a
zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work
challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization
algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

TL;DR: SpectRe, a new topological descriptor integrating spectral info into PH diagrams, enhances GNN expressivity beyond WL hierarchy and is locally stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PH-based methods lack structural info due to feature dependence.

Method: Integrates spectral info into PH diagrams for improved expressivity and stability.

Result: SpectRe is more expressive and locally stable, outperforming existing descriptors.

Conclusion: SpectRe effectively enhances graph model capabilities in learning tasks.

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances
the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods
are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context,
recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and
edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on
features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural
information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor
for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably,
SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We
also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing
descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe
and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant
learning tasks.

*Adarsh Prasad Behera,Jaya Prakash Champati,Roberto Morabito,Sasu Tarkoma,James Gross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys strategies for efficient inference in Language Models (LMs), focusing on routing and cascading to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMs are computationally expensive, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments like mobile or edge devices.

Method: Two strategies are explored: (i) routing (selecting models based on query complexity) and (ii) cascading (hierarchical inference escalating queries through models).

Result: These approaches reduce computation by using lightweight models for simpler tasks and larger models only when necessary.

Conclusion: Future research aims to improve response times, adaptive model selection, and scalable deployment for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of oversquashing in topological message-passing and extend graph-theoretic results to higher-order structures.

Method: Proposes a framework viewing simplicial and cellular complexes as relational structures, extending graph-theoretic algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates potential to mitigate oversquashing and advance topological deep learning through theoretical and empirical analysis.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges gaps in TDL, offering tools to analyze and improve higher-order message-passing networks.

Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
higher-order interactions in relational data. However, phenomena such as
oversquashing in topological message-passing remain understudied and lack
theoretical analysis. We propose a unifying axiomatic framework that bridges
graph and topological message-passing by viewing simplicial and cellular
complexes and their message-passing schemes through the lens of relational
structures. This approach extends graph-theoretic results and algorithms to
higher-order structures, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of
oversquashing in topological message-passing networks. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical studies on simplicial networks, we demonstrate the
potential of this framework to advance TDL.

*Mo Zhou,Weihang Xu,Maryam Fazel,Simon S. Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a global convergence guarantee for gradient EM in over-parameterized GMMs, proving it recovers ground truth for any well-separated GMMs with mild over-parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only proved global convergence for EM with 2 components, failing for 3+. This paper addresses the gap by analyzing over-parameterized settings.

Method: Uses gradient EM, Hermite polynomials for dynamics, and tensor decomposition for likelihood landscape analysis.

Result: Proves gradient EM globally converges to ground truth with polynomial rate and samples for well-separated GMMs.

Conclusion: First global convergence result for EM/Gradient EM beyond m=2, advancing understanding of GMM learning.

Abstract: Learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and its popular
variant gradient EM being arguably the most widely used algorithms in practice.
In the exact-parameterized setting, where both the ground truth GMM and the
learning model have the same number of components $m$, a vast line of work has
aimed to establish rigorous recovery guarantees for EM. However, global
convergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail
to recover the ground truth when $m\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we consider the $\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where
the learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth
GMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global
convergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated
GMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n
= \Omega(m\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the
ground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis
proceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian
Mixture analysis. We use Hermite polynomials to study the dynamics of gradient
EM and employ tensor decomposition to characterize the geometric landscape of
the likelihood loss. This is the first global convergence and recovery result
for EM or Gradient EM beyond the special case of $m=2$.

*Yuanjie Shi,Hooman Shahrokhi,Xuesong Jia,Xiongzhi Chen,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Direct Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM), a method to integrate conformal prediction into deep classifier training, reducing prediction set sizes with provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction methods produce large prediction sets, limiting practical utility. The paper aims to minimize set sizes by embedding conformal principles directly into training.

Method: Formulates conformal training as bilevel optimization, proposing DPSM to minimize prediction set size conditioned on learned conformity score quantiles.

Result: DPSM achieves a learning bound of O(1/√n), outperforming prior methods with 20.46% reduction in prediction set size.

Conclusion: DPSM effectively reduces prediction set sizes, validated by theory and experiments, enhancing practical utility of conformal prediction.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework
which works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction
sets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,
standard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which
makes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of
integrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers
to directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal
training as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\em Direct
Prediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight
behind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)
that is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).
We analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training
samples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic
approximation for the quantile has a bound of $\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size
$s$ and typically $s \ll \sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets
and deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior
conformal training baseline with $20.46\%\downarrow$ in the prediction set size
and validates our theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ADRD prediction algorithms haven't been adapted for broader CI, a precursor to ADRD. This study bridges that gap.

Method: Evaluated ADRD and sentiment analysis methods for CI prediction using patient audio recordings.

Result: Multimodal methods and acoustic features (affect, prosody) outperformed unimodal and linguistic features.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based approaches are more effective for CI prediction, with potential applications in early detection.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech.
However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of
broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk
factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source
methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from
multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio
recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal
ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better
than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features
relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform
BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features,
respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While popular optimization methods such as SGD, AdamW, and Lion depend on
steepest descent updates in either $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$ norms, there
remains a critical gap in handling the non-Euclidean structure observed in
modern deep networks training. In this work, we address this need by
introducing a new accelerated $\ell_p$ steepest descent algorithm, called
Stacey, which uses interpolated primal-dual iterate sequences to effectively
navigate non-Euclidean smooth optimization tasks. In addition to providing
novel theoretical guarantees for the foundations of our algorithm, we
empirically compare our approach against these popular methods on tasks
including image classification and language model (LLM) pretraining,
demonstrating both faster convergence and higher final accuracy. We further
evaluate different values of $p$ across various models and datasets,
underscoring the importance and efficiency of non-Euclidean approaches over
standard Euclidean methods. Code can be found at

TL;DR: The paper proposes E2H Reasoner, a curriculum learning method for improving reasoning in language models via reinforcement learning, showing better performance than vanilla RL alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning in language models, addressing the inefficiency of using RL alone for difficult tasks.

Method: Introduces E2H Reasoner, scheduling tasks from easy to hard (E2H) to gradually build reasoning skills, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: E2H Reasoner significantly improves reasoning in small LLMs (1.5B to 3B) compared to vanilla RL, with fewer samples needed.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning (E2H) is effective for improving reasoning in LLMs, especially for smaller models, by preventing overfitting and optimizing sample efficiency.

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: Demonstrates quantum-enhanced RWKV's potential for lightweight, efficient vision tasks, highlighting architectural trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in

and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of

TL;DR: A new NILM method using image load signatures and continual learning improves recognition accuracy by converting power signals into visual features and leveraging deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NILM methods struggle with poor feature robustness and insufficient generalization due to complex load combinations and environments.

Method: Converts multi-dimensional power signals into image load signatures, uses deep convolutional neural networks for classification, and employs continual learning to adapt to new loads.

Result: Significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances NILM performance by combining visual feature extraction and continual learning.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

TL;DR: The Spark Transformer introduces a novel architecture achieving high activation sparsity in FFN and attention mechanisms without compromising model quality or training efficiency, using top-k masking and statistical top-k for hardware-friendly sparsity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of modern Transformers due to inactive neurons and the challenges of reintroducing sparsity without degrading performance or increasing complexity.

Method: Utilizes top-k masking for explicit sparsity control, introduces statistical top-k for efficiency, and reallocates parameters to predict activated entries, maintaining model quality.

Result: Achieves 8% FFN neuron activation and 256-token attention, reducing FLOPs by 2.5x and improving decoding speed by up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

Conclusion: The Spark Transformer successfully balances sparsity and performance, offering significant efficiency gains for large models.

Abstract: The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where
the vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive
for each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for
enhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in
translating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved
away from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing
efforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,
increase parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,
the application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces
similar challenges.
  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that
achieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention
mechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard
training procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for
explicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical
top-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that
avoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard
top-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN
parameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for
identifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from
enforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the
Gemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on
standard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN
neurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This
sparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time
speedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine,
optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making
in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe
treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold
standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly
using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical
notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work,
we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation
framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes,
enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label
uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased
patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical
guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out
uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets
demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple
recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust
formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy
and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications.

### [453] [Rescaled Influence Functions: Accurate Data Attribution in High Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06656)
*Ittai Rubinstein,Samuel B. Hopkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces rescaled influence functions (RIF) as a more accurate alternative to traditional influence functions (IF) for data attribution, addressing IF's underestimation issues in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of data attribution methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where traditional influence functions (IF) often fail.

Method: Proposes rescaled influence functions (RIF), a drop-in replacement for IF, with minimal computational overhead but enhanced accuracy. Theoretical analysis and empirical comparisons on real-world datasets validate RIF's superiority.

Result: RIF significantly outperforms IF in predicting the effect of sample removals and detects data poisoning attacks that IF misses.

Conclusion: RIF is a practical and accurate tool for data attribution, addressing limitations of IF and enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: How does the training data affect a model's behavior? This is the question we
seek to answer with data attribution. The leading practical approaches to data
attribution are based on influence functions (IF). IFs utilize a first-order
Taylor approximation to efficiently predict the effect of removing a set of
samples from the training set without retraining the model, and are used in a
wide variety of machine learning applications. However, especially in the
high-dimensional regime (# params $\geq \Omega($# samples$)$), they are often
imprecise and tend to underestimate the effect of sample removals, even for
simple models such as logistic regression. We present rescaled influence
functions (RIF), a new tool for data attribution which can be used as a drop-in
replacement for influence functions, with little computational overhead but
significant improvement in accuracy. We compare IF and RIF on a range of
real-world datasets, showing that RIFs offer significantly better predictions
in practice, and present a theoretical analysis explaining this improvement.
Finally, we present a simple class of data poisoning attacks that would fool
IF-based detections but would be detected by RIF.

### [454] [SDP-CROWN: Efficient Bound Propagation for Neural Network Verification with Tightness of Semidefinite Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06665)
*Hong-Ming Chiu,Hao Chen,Huan Zhang,Richard Y. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDP-CROWN combines SDP tightness with bound-propagation scalability for neural network verification, improving tightness and performance on large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifiers either scale well but are loose (linear bound propagation) or are tight but not scalable (SDP). SDP-CROWN aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes SDP-CROWN, a hybrid framework using SDP-derived linear bounds to capture inter-neuron coupling, integrating it into bound-propagation pipelines.

Result: Achieves up to √n tighter bounds than traditional methods, with improved verification performance on large models (65k neurons, 2.47M parameters).

Conclusion: SDP-CROWN successfully balances tightness and scalability, offering near-SDP tightness while maintaining the scalability of bound-propagation methods.

Abstract: Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively
to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is
crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture
inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to
only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid
verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the
scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new
linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures
$\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra
parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear
bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods
yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our
inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional
per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art
$\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance
on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters,
achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable and explainable method for analyzing LBPs, crucial for penetrating defenses and accessing high-value spaces in football.

Method: Uses vertical spatial segmentation to model opponent team shape and identify disruptive passes, with metrics like SBR and LBPCh variants for evaluation.

Result: Applied to 2022 FIFA World Cup data, revealing stylistic differences in vertical progression and structural disruption among teams and players.

Conclusion: The framework is practical for performance analysis and scouting, offering insights into LBP effectiveness and tactical trends.

Abstract: Line-breaking passes (LBPs) are crucial tactical actions in football,
allowing teams to penetrate defensive lines and access high-value spaces. In
this study, we present an unsupervised, clustering-based framework for
detecting and analysing LBPs using synchronised event and tracking data from
elite matches. Our approach models opponent team shape through vertical spatial
segmentation and identifies passes that disrupt defensive lines within open
play. Beyond detection, we introduce several tactical metrics, including the
space build-up ratio (SBR) and two chain-based variants, LBPCh$^1$ and
LBPCh$^2$, which quantify the effectiveness of LBPs in generating immediate or
sustained attacking threats. We evaluate these metrics across teams and players
in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, revealing stylistic differences in vertical
progression and structural disruption. The proposed methodology is explainable,
scalable, and directly applicable to modern performance analysis and scouting
workflows.

*Di Lin,Wanjing Ren,Xuanbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HetCRF is a dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs, combining MAE and CL, outperforming baselines in node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in hybrid frameworks for heterogeneous graphs, such as semantic sparsity and gradient imbalance, by integrating MAE and CL effectively.

Method: Uses a two-stage aggregation strategy for semantic adaptation, enhances encoder output for view construction, and introduces positive sample augmentation strategies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving Macro-F1 scores by 2.75% and 2.2% on datasets with missing node features.

Conclusion: HetCRF is effective and superior for heterogeneous graph learning, especially in semantically sparse scenarios.

Abstract: In graph self-supervised learning, masked autoencoders (MAE) and contrastive
learning (CL) are two prominent paradigms. MAE focuses on reconstructing masked
elements, while CL maximizes similarity between augmented graph views. Recent
studies highlight their complementarity: MAE excels at local feature capture,
and CL at global information extraction. Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous
graphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to
meet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,
CL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive
and negative samples persists. This paper introduces HetCRF, a novel
dual-channel self-supervised learning framework for heterogeneous graphs.
HetCRF uses a two-stage aggregation strategy to adapt embedding semantics,
making it compatible with both MAE and CL. To address semantic sparsity, it
enhances encoder output for view construction instead of relying on raw
features, improving efficiency. Two positive sample augmentation strategies are
also proposed to balance gradient contributions. Node classification
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HetCRF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. On datasets with missing node
features, such as Aminer and Freebase, at a 40% label rate in node
classification, HetCRF improves the Macro-F1 score by 2.75% and 2.2%
respectively compared to the second-best baseline, validating its effectiveness
and superiority.

*Yuan Yuan,Yukun Liu,Chonghua Han,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveGCL is a privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models using generative continual learning, outperforming federated learning while protecting data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of building mobility foundation models due to privacy concerns and data silos motivates the development of MoveGCL.

Method: MoveGCL uses generative continual learning with synthetic trajectories, a distillation strategy, and a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer for mobility pattern heterogeneity.

Result: MoveGCL matches joint training performance and surpasses federated learning baselines on six urban datasets, ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: MoveGCL advances mobility foundation models with a scalable, privacy-preserving approach, setting a blueprint for future developments.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized fields such as natural language
processing and computer vision by enabling general-purpose learning across
diverse tasks and datasets. However, building analogous models for human
mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility
data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we
propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training
mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing
raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by
replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and
reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that
mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility
patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a
mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive
adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six
real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance
comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning
baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial
step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical
blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the
era of foundation models.

TL;DR: MarginSel improves ICL in LLMs by selecting hard examples, boosting F1-scores by 2-7% over random selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL's effectiveness depends on example selection and ordering, which MarginSel aims to optimize.

Method: MarginSel is a two-step method selecting hard demonstration examples for ICL, adapting per test instance.

Result: Achieves 2-7% F1-score improvement in classification tasks.

Conclusion: MarginSel enhances LLM performance by inducing max-margin behavior, analogous to support vectors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Protein Transformers' ability to capture biological intelligence in protein sequences, introducing a dataset (Protein-FN), a new Transformer architecture (SPT), and an XAI technique (Sequence Score). Results show high accuracy, and the XAI technique reveals biologically meaningful patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence in protein sequences and improve interpretability of their predictions.

Method: 1. Introduce Protein-FN dataset. 2. Devise Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT). 3. Develop Sequence Score XAI technique.

Result: SPT-Tiny achieves 94.3% accuracy on AR dataset and 99.6% on Protein-FN. Sequence Score reveals biologically meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: SPT models effectively capture biological intelligence, and Sequence Score enhances interpretability. The Protein-FN dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.

*Minh-Duc Nguyen,Dung D. Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVH-MOL, a method using Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to diversify and maximize hypervolume in Pareto set learning for multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to balance diversity and hypervolume maximization in Pareto set learning.

Method: Proposes SVH-MOL, employing SVGD to approximate the Pareto set, using diverse gradient directions and an annealing schedule for stability.

Result: SVH-MOL shows superior performance in experiments on multi-objective problems and multi-task learning.

Conclusion: SVH-MOL effectively addresses the challenge of diversifying Pareto solutions while maximizing hypervolume.

Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining
the complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of
optimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of
dense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current
methods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while
maximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
to approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards
the Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps
to converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse
gradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for
SVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing
schedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate
its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and
multi-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.

### [461] [The OCR Quest for Generalization: Learning to recognize low-resource alphabets with model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06761)
*Adrià Molina Rodríguez,Oriol Ramos Terrades,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve robustness in recognition systems for low-resource languages by leveraging model editing and domain merging, outperforming traditional fine-tuning and meta-learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-representation of low-resource languages (e.g., ancient manuscripts, non-western scripts) in recognition systems, enabling broader practical utility.

Method: Uses model editing and domain merging to generalize to new data distributions (e.g., alphabets) without reliance on massive pretraining or prototyping.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance boosts in transfer learning and out-of-domain evaluation, even with sparse data.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel approach for adopting under-represented alphabets, enhancing document recognition across diverse contexts and cultures.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIND improves test-time adaptation by addressing feature distribution shifts with layer-wise disentanglement and adaptive normalization, achieving 30% better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks struggle with performance under distribution shifts, reducing QoE. Existing TTA methods fail with dynamic, multiple test distributions.

Method: FIND uses Layer-wise Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN), and Selective FABN (S-FABN) to handle feature distribution shifts.

Result: FIND outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by 30% in dynamic scenarios while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FIND effectively addresses feature distribution shifts in TTA, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient aggregation mechanism for graph neural networks, trading some expressivity for stronger aggregation, and proposes the Caterpillar GNN, which performs well on challenging tasks and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional MPGNNs by introducing a more efficient and structured aggregation method.

Method: Develops an efficient aggregation mechanism and the Caterpillar GNN, using homomorphism counts from generalized caterpillar graphs to characterize expressive power.

Result: The Caterpillar GNN excels on synthetic tasks challenging for MPGNNs and matches performance on real-world datasets while reducing hidden layer nodes.

Conclusion: The Caterpillar GNN offers a scalable and efficient alternative to MPGNNs, balancing expressivity and aggregation strength.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph
learning, typically prioritizing maximal expressive power. In contrast, we
introduce an \emph{efficient aggregation} mechanism, deliberately trading off
some expressivity for stronger and more structured aggregation capabilities.
Our approach allows seamless scaling between classical message-passing and
simpler methods based on colored or plain walks. We rigorously characterize the
expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts from a
hierarchy of generalized \emph{caterpillar graphs}. Based on this foundation,
we propose the \emph{Caterpillar GNN}, whose robust graph-level aggregation
enables it to successfully tackle synthetic graph-level task specifically
designed to be challenging for classical MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that,
on real-world datasets, the Caterpillar GNN achieves comparable predictive
performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden
layers of the computational graph.

TL;DR: FuncGNN improves circuit representation by addressing structural heterogeneity and global logic loss in AIGs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern circuits' complexity and integration density cause structural heterogeneity and logic information loss in AIGs, hindering accurate modeling.

Method: FuncGNN uses hybrid feature aggregation, gate-aware normalization, and multi-layer integration to enhance circuit representations.

Result: FuncGNN achieves 2.06% and 18.71% improvements in tasks, reduces training time by 50.6%, and cuts GPU memory usage by 32.8%.

Conclusion: FuncGNN effectively addresses AIG limitations, offering a robust solution for logic circuit representation.

Abstract: As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective
circuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and
other automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs
(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for
representing Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing
complexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural
heterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant
challenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose
FuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract
multi-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural
heterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further
introduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate
distributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,
FuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across
layers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for
comprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level
analysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance
prediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while
reducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about
32.8%.

*Zixuan Dong,Yumi Omori,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the necessity of Optimal Transport (OT) in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) by proposing two simpler heuristic alternatives that avoid OT's complexity and perform comparably or better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT-based IRL methods, despite strong results, introduce complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving OT problems. The authors question whether OT's benefits justify its overhead.

Method: Two heuristic alternatives are proposed: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward (rewards based on nearest expert state) and (2) Segment-Matching Reward (lightweight temporal alignment). Both avoid OT optimization and have linear-time complexity.

Result: Evaluated across 32 benchmarks with three RL algorithms, the simple methods match or outperform OT-based approaches, suggesting OT's benefits may stem from basic proximity alignment.

Conclusion: The study advocates reevaluating the need for OT's complexity in IRL, as simpler methods can achieve similar or better performance.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from
expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been
successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based
methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic
complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization
problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing
two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns
rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2)
Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by
matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These
methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to
implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline
benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our
simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings
suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment
rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of
complexity in future IRL design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for heterogeneous graphs underutilize node information along meta-paths, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes IMPA-HGAE, which exploits internal node information along meta-paths and introduces masking strategies for generative SSL.

Result: IMPA-HGAE achieves superior performance on heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The work advances robust representation learning in heterogeneous graphs and suggests future directions for generative SSL.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to
diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and
low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models
convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training,
which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while
underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE
to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information
along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves
superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper
introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational
capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally,
this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential
future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous
graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural
semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper explores neural diffusion processes for global optimization using Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler, showing promise in low to mid-dimensional tasks but struggling with high-dimensional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the application of neural diffusion processes and the Path Integral Sampler for global optimization, leveraging the Boltzmann distribution and stochastic control theory.

Method: Formulates optimization as a Schrödinger bridge sampling problem, applies Girsanov's theorem with a single-point prior, and approximates solutions using a Fourier MLP.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance in 2 to 1,247 dimensions but struggles with a 15.9k parameter model, highlighting limitations in high-dimensional exploration.

Conclusion: The optimizer shows potential for low to mid-dimensional tasks but requires adaptation improvements for high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: We present an early investigation into the use of neural diffusion processes
for global optimisation, focusing on Zhang et al.'s Path Integral Sampler. One
can use the Boltzmann distribution to formulate optimization as solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge sampling problem, then apply Girsanov's theorem with a
simple (single-point) prior to frame it in stochastic control terms, and
compute the solution's integral terms via a neural approximation (a Fourier
MLP). We provide theoretical bounds for this optimiser, results on toy
optimisation tasks, and a summary of the stochastic theory motivating the
model. Ultimately, we found the optimiser to display promising per-step
performance at optimisation tasks between 2 and 1,247 dimensions, but struggle
to explore higher-dimensional spaces when faced with a 15.9k parameter model,
indicating a need for work on adaptation in such environments.

Conclusion: CEMS provides an effective solution for regression tasks, demonstrating the value of higher-order manifold approximations in data augmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning models with a large number of parameters, often referred to as
over-parameterized models, have achieved exceptional performance across various
tasks. Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize
well to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data
augmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has
shown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving
transformations, its application in regression problems has received less
attention. Recently, a novel \emph{manifold learning} approach for generating
synthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data
manifold. Building on this foundation, we present a theoretical framework and
practical tools for approximating and sampling general data manifolds.
Furthermore, we introduce the Curvature-Enhanced Manifold Sampling (CEMS)
method for regression tasks. CEMS leverages a second-order representation of
the data manifold to enable efficient sampling and reconstruction of new data
points. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that CEMS delivers superior performance in
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while introducing only
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

*Ziwei Li,Yuhan Duan,Tianyu Xiong,Yi-Tang Chen,Wei-Lun Chao,Han-Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FA-INR improves surrogate modeling by using cross-attention and a memory bank for adaptive feature representation, achieving high fidelity with reduced model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INRs struggle with complex scientific fields due to rigid geometric structures, limiting flexibility and increasing model size.

Method: Proposes FA-INR, using cross-attention to a memory bank and a coordinate-guided MoE for adaptive feature allocation.

Result: FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on large-scale datasets while reducing model size.

Conclusion: FA-INR establishes a better trade-off between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific
simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and
continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often
struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency
variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features
along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility
and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to
an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling
adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather
than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce
a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization
and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale
ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art
fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off
frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

### [470] [Differentially Private Sparse Linear Regression with Heavy-tailed Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06861)
*Xizhi Tian,Meng Ding,Touming Tao,Zihang Xiang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies DP sparse linear regression for high-dimensional, heavy-tailed data, proposing two methods (DP-IHT-H and DP-IHT-L) with improved error bounds and demonstrating their superiority over standard DP algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP linear regression methods are limited to regular data or low dimensions, leaving a gap for high-dimensional, heavy-tailed data.

Method: Proposes DP-IHT-H (using Huber loss and iterative hard thresholding) and DP-IHT-L (with stricter assumptions), both under $\varepsilon, \delta$-DP.

Result: DP-IHT-H achieves a tail-dependent error bound, while DP-IHT-L improves it to a tail-independent bound. Both outperform standard DP methods.

Conclusion: The methods effectively address DP sparse linear regression for high-dimensional, heavy-tailed data, offering theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: As a fundamental problem in machine learning and differential privacy (DP),
DP linear regression has been extensively studied. However, most existing
methods focus primarily on either regular data distributions or low-dimensional
cases with irregular data. To address these limitations, this paper provides a
comprehensive study of DP sparse linear regression with heavy-tailed responses
in high-dimensional settings. In the first part, we introduce the DP-IHT-H
method, which leverages the Huber loss and private iterative hard thresholding
to achieve an estimation error bound of \(
  \tilde{O}\biggl(
  s^{* \frac{1 }{2}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log d}{n}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  +
  s^{* \frac{1 + 2\zeta}{2 + 2\zeta}}
  \cdot \biggl(\frac{\log^2 d}{n \varepsilon}\biggr)^{\frac{\zeta}{1 + \zeta}}
  \biggr) \) under the $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size, $d$ is the dimensionality, $s^*$ is the sparsity of the parameter,
and $\zeta \in (0, 1]$ characterizes the tail heaviness of the data. In the
second part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under
additional assumptions on the response and achieves \(
  \tilde{O}\Bigl(\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \log d}{n \varepsilon}\Bigr). \) Compared to
the first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\zeta$.
Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for
``regular'' data.

*Dongyeop Lee,Kwanhee Lee,Jinseok Chung,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFE and SAFE$^+$, methods for sparsifying neural networks by optimizing for both sparsity and flatness, improving generalization and resilience to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in sparsified neural networks by finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat.

Method: Formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem with flatness as an objective, solved via augmented Lagrange dual and generalized projection.

Result: SAFE yields sparse networks with improved generalization, competitive with baselines, and shows resilience to noisy data.

Conclusion: SAFE and SAFE$^+$ effectively balance sparsity and flatness, enhancing performance and robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable
performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original
performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust
optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are
both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a
sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an
objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and
extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in
novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive
evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal
that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization
performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In
addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for
real-world conditions.

### [472] [Log-Sum-Exponential Estimator for Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06873)
*Armin Behnamnia,Gholamali Aminian,Alireza Aghaei,Chengchun Shi,Vincent Y. F. Tan,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a log-sum-exponential (LSE) estimator for off-policy learning and evaluation, addressing challenges like high variance and heavy-tailed rewards. It shows improved performance over traditional methods, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy learning and evaluation face issues like high variance and poor performance with low-quality propensity scores or heavy-tailed rewards. The paper aims to mitigate these challenges.

Method: The authors propose a novel LSE estimator, analyze its bias and variance for off-policy evaluation, and derive regret bounds for off-policy learning, assuming bounded moments of weighted rewards.

Result: The LSE estimator reduces variance and is robust under heavy-tailed conditions. Theoretical bounds and empirical results confirm its superiority over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The LSE estimator is effective for off-policy tasks, offering theoretical guarantees and practical benefits, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Off-policy learning and evaluation leverage logged bandit feedback datasets,
which contain context, action, propensity score, and feedback for each data
point. These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and
poor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward
distributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based
on the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional
inverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance
reduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy
evaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the
off-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the
performance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming
bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward. Notably, we achieve a
convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+ \epsilon)})$ for the regret bounds,
where $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and $n$ is the size of logged bandit feedback
dataset. Theoretical analysis is complemented by comprehensive empirical
evaluations in both off-policy learning and evaluation scenarios, confirming
the practical advantages of our approach. The code for our estimator is

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FREE, a GAN-based adversarial training method for Early Exit in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve inference speed without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs face challenges in real-world applications due to high inference latency. Training exit classifiers is difficult with limited labeled data.

Method: FREE uses adversarial training where each exit has a transformer layer and classifier. The transformer mimics final-layer features, and a classifier acts as a discriminator.

Result: FREE speeds up inference by 1.51x with minimal performance drop, improving accuracy and robustness by addressing overthinking and mid-crisis.

Conclusion: FREE effectively balances speed and performance in VLMs, validated by experiments.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

*Paulius Sasnauskas,Yiğit Yalın,Goran Radanović*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AT-DPT, an adversarial training framework for DPT to combat reward poisoning attacks, showing superior robustness in bandit and MDP settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of DPT to reward poisoning attacks in ICRL.

Method: Simultaneously trains an attacker to poison rewards and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from poisoned data.

Result: AT-DPT outperforms robust baselines in bandit settings and generalizes to MDPs.

Conclusion: AT-DPT effectively enhances the corruption-robustness of DPT in ICRL.

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning
(ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al.,
2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT,
we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained
Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an
attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment
rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms,
including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in
bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on
an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our
evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in
bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Sebastian Ament,Maximilian Balandat,David Eriksson,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Eytan Bakshy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to apply Gaussian processes (GPs) to large datasets by leveraging latent Kronecker structure, enabling efficient computation without approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability of GPs for large datasets is limited by computational constraints, especially when data lacks grid structure due to missing observations.

Method: The method uses latent Kronecker structure to express the kernel matrix of observed values as a projection of a latent Kronecker product, combined with iterative solvers and pathwise conditioning.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables exact GP inference with reduced computational resources, addressing scalability challenges in large datasets.

Abstract: Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge
due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the
Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their
application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In
particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel
matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be
expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any
observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which
frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this
limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the
kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker
product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise
conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational
GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including
robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.

*Fred Xu,Thomas Markovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel message passing scheme for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that improves uncertainty estimation under distributional shifts by incorporating spatial-temporal noises inspired by Gaussian Processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty estimation in GNNs is challenging due to randomness from graph structure and label distribution, especially under distributional shifts.

Method: The method draws an analogy between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by Matern Gaussian Processes and GNN message passing, designing a scheme with spatial-temporal noises for better uncertainty capture.

Result: The approach enhances uncertainty estimates on graphs with varying label informativeness and outperforms existing methods in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides principled uncertainty estimation for GNNs, improving robustness under distributional shifts.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network
modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains
difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional
uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness
arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds
complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian
Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to
design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises
motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously
captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the
covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs
with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label
informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: GraPhy is a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework for high-resolution air quality modeling in urban areas with sparse monitoring data, outperforming baselines by 9%-56%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained air quality monitoring is crucial for public health, but sparse networks in disadvantaged regions limit modeling accuracy.

Method: GraPhy uses a physics-guided graph neural network architecture tailored for low-resolution monitoring data.

Result: GraPhy achieves the best performance (MSE, MAE, R2) in experiments, improving over baselines by 9%-56%.

Conclusion: GraPhy effectively addresses sparse data challenges and outperforms baselines across varying spatial heterogeneity.

Abstract: This work introduces GraPhy, a graph-based, physics-guided learning framework
for high-resolution and accurate air quality modeling in urban areas with
limited monitoring data. Fine-grained air quality monitoring information is
essential for reducing public exposure to pollutants. However, monitoring
networks are often sparse in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions, limiting
the accuracy and resolution of air quality modeling. To address this, we
propose a physics-guided graph neural network architecture called GraPhy with
layers and edge features designed specifically for low-resolution monitoring
data. Experiments using data from California's socioeconomically disadvantaged
San Joaquin Valley show that GraPhy achieves the overall best performance
evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-square
value (R2), improving the performance by 9%-56% compared to various baseline
models. Moreover, GraPhy consistently outperforms baselines across different
spatial heterogeneity levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model
design.

*Wei Min Loh,Jiaqi Shang,Pascal Poupart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture, basis transformers, improves tabular data handling by addressing partial information, noise, and heterogeneous structure, outperforming baselines in regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques fail to handle key aspects of tabular data like textual info, variable columns, and unseen data without metadata.

Method: Proposes basis transformers, respecting tabular data invariances like hierarchical structure and numeric value representation.

Result: Achieves 0.338 median R² improvement and lowest standard deviation on OpenML-CTR23, with fewer parameters than baselines.

Conclusion: Basis transformers effectively address tabular data challenges, outperforming even pretrained large language models.

Abstract: Dealing with tabular data is challenging due to partial information, noise,
and heterogeneous structure. Existing techniques often struggle to
simultaneously address key aspects of tabular data such as textual information,
a variable number of columns, and unseen data without metadata besides column
names. We propose a novel architecture, \textit{basis transformers},
specifically designed to tackle these challenges while respecting inherent
invariances in tabular data, including hierarchical structure and the
representation of numeric values. We evaluate our design on a multi-task
tabular regression benchmark, achieving an improvement of 0.338 in the median
$R^2$ score and the lowest standard deviation across 34 tasks from the
OpenML-CTR23 benchmark. Furthermore, our model has five times fewer parameters
than the best-performing baseline and surpasses pretrained large language model
baselines -- even when initialized from randomized weights.

*Mahdi Salmani,Alireza Abdollahpoorrostam,Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for decision-based black-box adversarial attacks under asymmetric query costs, proposing Asymmetric Search (AS) and Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST) to minimize total attack cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume equal query costs, but practical scenarios involve asymmetric costs (e.g., content moderation systems). Effective algorithms for such settings are lacking.

Method: The framework modifies search strategy (AS) and gradient estimation (AGREST) to favor low-cost queries, balancing query types to minimize total cost.

Result: The method achieves up to 40% lower total query cost and smaller perturbations compared to existing approaches across various cost regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses asymmetric query costs in black-box attacks, offering significant improvements over prior methods.

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores progressive sharpening in deep neural networks using a minimalist deep linear network model, analyzing its dynamics and extending insights to practical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the poorly understood mechanisms behind progressive sharpening in deep neural networks during training.

Method: Uses a deep linear network with a single neuron per layer as a minimalist model to study sharpness dynamics, analyzing effects of dataset properties, network depth, optimizer stochasticity, and step size.

Result: The minimalist model captures empirical sharpness dynamics, and theoretical insights extend to practical neural network training scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

Abstract: When training deep neural networks with gradient descent, sharpness often
increases -- a phenomenon known as progressive sharpening -- before saturating
at the edge of stability. Although commonly observed in practice, the
underlying mechanisms behind progressive sharpening remain poorly understood.
In this work, we study this phenomenon using a minimalist model: a deep linear
network with a single neuron per layer. We show that this simple model
effectively captures the sharpness dynamics observed in recent empirical
studies, offering a simple testbed to better understand neural network
training. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how dataset properties, network
depth, stochasticity of optimizers, and step size affect the degree of
progressive sharpening in the minimalist model. We then empirically demonstrate
how these theoretical insights extend to practical scenarios. This study offers
a deeper understanding of sharpness dynamics in neural network training,
highlighting the interplay between depth, training data, and optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A risk-regularized quantile-based RL algorithm using CVaR to enforce safety, improving performance and safety in stochastic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overestimation bias and safety constraints in RL without complex architectures or manual tradeoffs.

Method: Quantile-based action-value iteration with CVaR integration for safety, supported by theoretical guarantees in Wasserstein space.

Result: Improved goal successes, fewer collisions, and better safety-performance trade-offs in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances performance and safety in stochastic RL tasks.

Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in
high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration
methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go
using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies
safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not
explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require
complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost
functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based
algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety
without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the
contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in
Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution.
Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our
approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better
safety-performance trade-offs compared to risk-neutral methods.

*Pengfei Hu,Xiaoxue Han,Fei Wang,Yue Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework, improves domain generalization in clinical prediction by leveraging medical ontologies to discover latent domains and integrating clinical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of domain generalization in clinical prediction, where domain labels are often unavailable and purely data-driven methods overlook medical knowledge.

Method: Uses hierarchical medical ontologies (e.g., ICD-9-CM) to group diseases, prunes domains iteratively, encodes refined domains, and employs a Siamese-type inference mechanism.

Result: Outperforms other domain generalization baselines on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, especially with significant domain gaps.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of integrating medical knowledge to enhance domain generalization in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 1-identification problem in multi-armed bandits, proposing a new algorithm (SEE) for non-asymptotic analysis and achieving near-optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the unclear non-asymptotic analysis of the 1-identification problem, as noted by Degenne & Koolen (2019).

Method: Design of the Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE) algorithm, analyzed theoretically for non-asymptotic performance.

Result: Near-optimal sample complexity, with upper and lower bounds differing by a polynomial logarithmic factor. Numerical results validate SEE's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The SEE algorithm provides a near-optimal solution to the 1-identification problem, bridging the gap in non-asymptotic analysis.

Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the
1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure
exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean
reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes
such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct
with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the
asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but
they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a
new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct
theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the
literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and
lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower
bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also
indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective integration of multi-omic data is challenging due to heterogeneity, requiring robust methods for personalized cancer treatment.

Method: Proposes MoXGATE, a framework using cross-attention and learnable modality weights for feature fusion, with focal loss for data imbalance.

Conclusion: MoXGATE is a promising, interpretable, and adaptable solution for multi-omic cancer subtype classification.

Abstract: Cancer subtype classification is crucial for personalized treatment and
prognostic assessment. However, effectively integrating multi-omic data remains
challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of genomic, epigenomic, and
transcriptomic features. In this work, we propose Modality-Aware
Cross-Attention MoXGATE, a novel deep-learning framework that leverages
cross-attention and learnable modality weights to enhance feature fusion across
multiple omics sources. Our approach effectively captures inter-modality
dependencies, ensuring robust and interpretable integration. Through
experiments on Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma (GIAC) and Breast Cancer (BRCA)
datasets from TCGA, we demonstrate that MoXGATE outperforms existing methods,
achieving 95\% classification accuracy. Ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of cross-attention over simple concatenation and highlight the
importance of different omics modalities. Moreover, our model generalizes well
to unseen cancer types e.g., breast cancer, underscoring its adaptability. Key
contributions include (1) a cross-attention-based multi-omic integration
framework, (2) modality-weighted fusion for enhanced interpretability, (3)
application of focal loss to mitigate data imbalance, and (4) validation across
multiple cancer subtypes. Our results indicate that MoXGATE is a promising
approach for multi-omic cancer subtype classification, offering improved
performance and biological generalizability.

*Anastasia Koloskova,Youssef Allouah,Animesh Jha,Rachid Guerraoui,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for certified machine unlearning is proposed, ensuring provable guarantees without restrictive assumptions, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns and regulatory requirements like the 'right to be forgotten' by removing specific training data's influence from models.

Method: Noisy fine-tuning on retain data to leverage privacy amplification by stochastic post-processing, requiring no loss function assumptions.

Result: The method achieves formal unlearning guarantees and performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is broadly applicable, efficient, and accurate, providing a practical solution for machine unlearning.

Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the
influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by
privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be
forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or
lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified
machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy
amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning
on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure
provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the
underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings.
We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and
demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning
guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing
baselines. Our code is available at

### [486] [Fully Explainable Classification Models Using Hyperblocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06986)
*Austin Snyder,Ryan Gallagher,Boris Kovalerchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances Hyperblocks for better interpretability, faster training, and reduced complexity while maintaining accuracy. It introduces simplification algorithms and a k-NN fallback for robustness, showing competitive performance on high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Hyperblocks by making them more interpretable and simpler without losing accuracy, enabling SMEs to understand the model without deep ML expertise.

Method: Introduces algorithms for Hyperblock simplification (removing redundant attributes/blocks, creating disjunctive units) and a k-NN fallback for uncovered data points.

Result: Achieves strong predictive performance with reduced complexity on datasets like WBC (9-D) and MNIST (784-D).

Conclusion: Interpretable models can scale to high-dimensional, large datasets while maintaining accuracy, offering a transparent alternative to black-box models in trust-critical domains.

Abstract: Building on existing work with Hyperblocks, which classify data using minimum
and maximum bounds for each attribute, we focus on enhancing interpretability,
decreasing training time, and reducing model complexity without sacrificing
accuracy. This system allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to directly inspect
and understand the model's decision logic without requiring extensive machine
learning expertise. To reduce Hyperblock complexity while retaining
performance, we introduce a suite of algorithms for Hyperblock simplification.
These include removing redundant attributes, removing redundant blocks through
overlap analysis, and creating disjunctive units. These methods eliminate
unnecessary parameters, dramatically reducing model size without harming
classification power. We increase robustness by introducing an interpretable
fallback mechanism using k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers for points not
covered by any block, ensuring complete data coverage while preserving model
transparency. Our results demonstrate that interpretable models can scale to
high-dimensional, large-volume datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy.
On benchmark datasets such as WBC (9-D), we achieve strong predictive
performance with significantly reduced complexity. On MNIST (784-D), our method
continues to improve through tuning and simplification, showing promise as a
transparent alternative to black-box models in domains where trust, clarity,
and control are crucial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes local optimality guarantees of K-means, proposes modifications for improved local optimality, and validates results numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous analysis on K-means' local optimality and improve its clustering performance.

Method: Proposes modifications to K-means ensuring local optimality, using Bregman divergence as a dissimilarity measure.

Result: Numerical experiments show improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance K-means' local optimality without increasing computational complexity.

Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms
in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to
achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of
its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions
under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution.
Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which
ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the
same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the
dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an
extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means
algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not
always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods
provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.

*Arun Sharma,Mingzhou Yang,Majid Farhadloo,Subhankar Ghosh,Bharat Jayaprakash,Shashi Shekhar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a physics-informed diffusion model to detect anomalous trajectories, improving accuracy by integrating kinematic constraints and addressing data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To curb illegal activities like unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers by identifying GPS spoofing in trajectory data.

Method: Uses a physics-informed diffusion model incorporating kinematic constraints to detect trajectories violating physical laws.

Result: Achieves higher prediction accuracy and lower error rates in anomaly detection and trajectory generation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively identifies anomalous trajectories, outperforming existing methods by leveraging physical knowledge.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProbHardE2E is a probabilistic forecasting framework enforcing hard constraints via a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL), enabling end-to-end learning, robust uncertainty quantification, and handling non-linear constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often handle constraints post-processing or at inference, lack robust uncertainty quantification, and rely on biased distributional assumptions. ProbHardE2E addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses DPPL to enforce hard constraints and optimize strictly proper scoring rules without distributional assumptions, applicable to neural networks.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in learning PDEs with uncertainty and probabilistic time-series forecasting, bridging disparate domains.

Conclusion: ProbHardE2E is a versatile framework for probabilistic forecasting with hard constraints, offering robust uncertainty quantification and flexibility.

Abstract: We present a general purpose probabilistic forecasting framework,
ProbHardE2E, to learn systems that can incorporate operational/physical
constraints as hard requirements. ProbHardE2E enforces hard constraints by
exploiting variance information in a novel way; and thus it is also capable of
performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the model. Our methodology uses a
novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined
with a wide range of neural network architectures. This DPPL allows the model
to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where
the constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at
inference. In addition, ProbHardE2E can optimize a strictly proper scoring
rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which
enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing
approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are
heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it
can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of
modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E to problems in learning partial
differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic
time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general setup
that connects these seemingly disparate domains.

### [490] [Comparison of Lightweight Methods for Vehicle Dynamics-Based Driver Drowsiness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07014)
*Yutaro Nakagama,Daisuke Ishii,Kazuki Yoshizoe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares vehicle dynamics-based driver drowsiness detection (DDD) methods using a transparent framework and public dataset, highlighting reproducibility issues and proposing a high-accuracy random forest method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about reliability and reproducibility in existing DDD methods, which often suffer from data leakage and lack of open datasets.

Method: Develop a framework for feature extraction and DDD using lightweight ML models, implement three existing methods and a random forest-based method, and evaluate performance.

Result: The RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88%, outperforming other evaluated methods.

Conclusion: The study reveals issues in non-standard DDD methods and demonstrates the effectiveness of a properly implemented high-performance approach.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness detection (DDD) prevents road accidents caused by driver
fatigue. Vehicle dynamics-based DDD has been proposed as a method that is both
economical and high performance. However, there are concerns about the
reliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the
existing methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data
leakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide
the datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance
of representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and
fair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for
extracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD
with lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a
variety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative
methods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.
Finally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and
clarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated
methods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %. Our
findings imply the issues inherent in DDD methods developed in a non-standard
manner, and demonstrate a high performance method implemented appropriately.

### [491] [AlphaSteer: Learning Refusal Steering with Principled Null-Space Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07022)
*Leheng Sheng,Changshuo Shen,Weixiang Zhao,Junfeng Fang,Xiaohao Liu,Zhenkai Liang,Xiang Wang,An Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlphaSteer is a theoretically grounded activation steering method for LLMs, balancing safety and utility by learning separate steering vectors for benign and malicious prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLMs can refuse malicious prompts (e.g., jailbreak attacks) without degrading performance on benign prompts is critical for safe deployment.

Method: AlphaSteer learns two objectives: utility preservation (null-space constraints for benign prompts) and safety enhancement (linear regression for malicious prompts).

Result: AlphaSteer significantly improves LLM safety without compromising general capabilities, validated across multiple jailbreak attacks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: AlphaSteer provides a robust and effective solution to the safety-utility trade-off in LLMs, with open-source code available.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

*Yung-Chien Wang,Kuang-Da Wang,Wei-Yao Wang,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MATI addresses tabular imbalance regression with a mixture of experts and test-time self-supervised aggregation, improving MAE by 7.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imbalance regression work assumes known and balanced test distributions, which may not hold in practice, leading to performance degradation.

Method: MATI uses a Gaussian Mixture Model for region-aware experts and dynamically adjusts expert weights at test time.

Result: MATI improves MAE by 7.1% on average across three test distributions.

Conclusion: MATI effectively handles tabular imbalance regression by adapting to varying test distributions.

Abstract: Tabular data serve as a fundamental and ubiquitous representation of
structured information in numerous real-world applications, e.g., finance and
urban planning. In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance
has been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in
certain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability. However, the
imbalance issue of tabular regression tasks is underexplored, and yet is
critical due to unclear boundaries for continuous labels and simplifying
assumptions in existing imbalance regression work, which often rely on known
and balanced test distributions. Such assumptions may not hold in practice and
can lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:
Mixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular
Imbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware
Mixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying
related regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then
used to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique
characteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised
Expert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on
test data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test
distributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance
regression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.
To reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test
distributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a
normal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution
that emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test
distributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: First Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust average reward MDPs with non-asymptotic convergence under uncertainty sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance theory of distributionally robust reinforcement learning in average reward settings.

Method: Uses robust Q Bellman operator as a contractive mapping, stochastic approximation for Q-function learning, and robust policy mirror descent for actor-critic.

Result: Achieves optimal robust Q-function in Õ(ε⁻²) samples and ε-optimal robust policy in Õ(ε⁻³) samples.

Conclusion: Advances robust RL theory with efficient sample complexity guarantees.

Abstract: We present the first $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust
average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with non-asymptotic convergence
under contamination, TV distance and Wasserstein distance uncertainty sets. We
show that the robust $Q$ Bellman operator is a strict contractive mapping with
respect to a carefully constructed semi-norm with constant functions being
quotiented out. This property supports a stochastic approximation update, that
learns the optimal robust $Q$ function in $\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples.
We also show that the same idea can be used for robust $Q$ function estimation,
which can be further used for critic estimation. Coupling it with theories in
robust policy mirror descent update, we present a natural actor-critic
algorithm that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy in
$\tilde{\cO}(\epsilon^{-3})$ samples. These results advance the theory of
distributionally robust reinforcement learning in the average reward setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairPFN is a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic data to address causal fairness in ML without needing prior causal model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML systems often perpetuate biases from historical data, and current causal fairness frameworks require known causal models, limiting their use in complex scenarios.

Method: FairPFN is pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness data to identify and mitigate protected attribute effects without needing a causal model.

Result: FairPFN performs well in removing causal effects of protected attributes across diverse scenarios, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: FairPFN advances causal fairness accessibility for complex problems, enabling broader application.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as
healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often
trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML
decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal
fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate
algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and
indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key
limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model,
restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal
models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose
FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness
data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its
predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the
causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and
removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and
real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way
for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a
wider variety of complex fairness problems.

TL;DR: PGTS integrates tree search to improve policy gradient methods, reducing suboptimal local optima and enhancing worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PG methods often converge to suboptimal solutions, especially in complex environments. PGTS aims to address this by incorporating lookahead.

Method: PGTS uses an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to refine policy optimization, theoretically reducing undesirable stationary points.

Result: Empirical tests show PGTS outperforms standard PG in navigating complex environments and escaping local traps.

Conclusion: PGTS enhances policy optimization by leveraging tree search, offering better performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Classical policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently
converge to suboptimal local optima, a challenge exacerbated in large or
complex environments. This work investigates Policy Gradient with Tree Search
(PGTS), an approach that integrates an $m$-step lookahead mechanism to enhance
policy optimization. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that
increasing the tree search depth $m$-monotonically reduces the set of
undesirable stationary points and, consequently, improves the worst-case
performance of any resulting stationary policy. Critically, our analysis
accommodates practical scenarios where policy updates are restricted to states
visited by the current policy, rather than requiring updates across the entire
state space. Empirical evaluations on diverse MDP structures, including Ladder,
Tightrope, and Gridworld environments, illustrate PGTS's ability to exhibit
"farsightedness," navigate challenging reward landscapes, escape local traps
where standard PG fails, and achieve superior solutions.

*Jiaheng Dong,Hong Jia,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Abhirup Ghosh,James Bailey,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-BATS is an efficient backpropagation-free test-time adaptation framework for speech foundation models, balancing effectiveness and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in speech models due to acoustic domain shifts (e.g., noise, accents) without source data or labels.

Method: Uses lightweight prompt adaptation, multi-scale loss, and test-time exponential moving average for stable adaptation.

Result: Achieves 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings.

Conclusion: E-BATS enables scalable and robust adaptation for real-world speech processing.

Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when
deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as
background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently
emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time
without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA
approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are
memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and
resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer
improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they
are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from
speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing
unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the
first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for
speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation
effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)
lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)
a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local
distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving
average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments
conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions
demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over
backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to
backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under
acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient
adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: State entropy regularization in RL improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated perturbations, unlike standard robust RL methods. Theoretical guarantees and practical insights are provided, contrasting it with policy entropy regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of state entropy regularization's benefits in RL, particularly its robustness to structured and spatially correlated perturbations, which are common in transfer learning.

Method: The paper analyzes state entropy regularization theoretically and empirically, comparing it with policy entropy regularization under reward and transition uncertainty.

Result: State entropy regularization offers better robustness to structured perturbations but is more sensitive to the number of rollouts for policy evaluation compared to policy entropy.

Conclusion: State entropy regularization is theoretically and practically advantageous for certain robustness scenarios, though its performance depends on evaluation conditions.

Abstract: State entropy regularization has empirically shown better exploration and
sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL). However, its theoretical
guarantees have not been studied. In this paper, we show that state entropy
regularization improves robustness to structured and spatially correlated
perturbations. These types of variation are common in transfer learning but
often overlooked by standard robust RL methods, which typically focus on small,
uncorrelated changes. We provide a comprehensive characterization of these
robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition
uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our
analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy
regularization, highlighting their different benefits. Finally, from a
practical standpoint, we illustrate that compared with policy entropy, the
robustness advantages of state entropy are more sensitive to the number of
rollouts used for policy evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation method for ℓ²-regularized non-linear least-squares, focusing on local minimizers of the training loss. It provides a pointwise confidence bound that scales with test input similarity to training data, leveraging a weighted norm involving the inverse-Hessian matrix. The method is efficient and outperforms bootstrapping in coverage/width trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable confidence estimation in non-linear least-squares settings, especially for local minimizers, and to provide a scalable solution that adapts to test input similarity.

Method: Proposes a pointwise confidence bound using a weighted norm involving the inverse-Hessian matrix, generalizing the linear setting's approach. Introduces an efficient computation method for this norm.

Result: The confidence bound scales with test input similarity to training data and is computationally efficient. Empirical results show it outperforms bootstrapping in coverage/width trade-off.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and efficient solution for confidence estimation in non-linear least-squares, with empirical validation supporting its superiority over bootstrapping.

Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the
$\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In
particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the
regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that
it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the
proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the
training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,
becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).
This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the
inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized
version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$.
Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the
classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE
estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,
which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss
function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing
that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off
compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard
method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural
networks.

TL;DR: A novel distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique using data transformation (DT) methods improves clinical decision support by combining time series and static data, enhancing prediction performance and reducing computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure patient similarity for better clinical decision support by leveraging historical clinical records, addressing computational challenges in big data.

Method: Combines time series (e.g., heart rate) and static data (e.g., demographics) using adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score DT methods. Employs distributed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for time series similarity.

Result: Boosts prediction performance (e.g., 11.4% AUC for Coronary Artery Disease) and reduces computation time by up to 40%.

Conclusion: The DPSC technique effectively improves patient similarity computation, enhancing clinical decision support while addressing privacy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Patient similarity computation (PSC) is a fundamental problem in healthcare
informatics. The aim of the patient similarity computation is to measure the
similarity among patients according to their historical clinical records, which
helps to improve clinical decision support. This paper presents a novel
distributed patient similarity computation (DPSC) technique based on data
transformation (DT) methods, utilizing an effective combination of time series
and static data. Time series data are sensor-collected patients' information,
including metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, Oxygen saturation,
respiration, etc. The static data are mainly patient background and demographic
data, including age, weight, height, gender, etc. Static data has been used for
clustering the patients. Before feeding the static data to the machine learning
model adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE) and Z-score data transformation (DT)
methods have been performed, which improve the prediction performances. In
aWOE-based patient similarity models, sensitive patient information has been
processed using aWOE which preserves the data privacy of the trained models. We
used the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach, which is robust and very popular,
for time series similarity. However, DTW is not suitable for big data due to
the significant computational run-time. To overcome this problem, distributed
DTW computation is used in this study. For Coronary Artery Disease, our DT
based approach boosts prediction performance by as much as 11.4%, 10.20%, and
12.6% in terms of AUC, accuracy, and F-measure, respectively. In the case of
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), our proposed method achieves performance
enhancement up to 15.9%, 10.5%, and 21.9% for the same measures, respectively.
The proposed method reduces the computation time by as high as 40%.

*Wenying He,Jieling Huang,Junhua Gu,Ji Zhang,Yude Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoFILL, a Conditional Diffusion Model, addresses spatiotemporal data imputation challenges by leveraging a dual-stream architecture for robust and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems due to hardware/software failures hampers applications like environmental monitoring and traffic management. Existing methods struggle with interdependencies and cumulative errors.

Method: CoFILL uses a Conditional Diffusion Model with a dual-stream architecture to process temporal and frequency domain features in parallel, enhancing imputation quality.

Result: CoFILL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, transforming noise into meaningful data aligned with true distributions.

Conclusion: CoFILL offers a robust solution for spatiotemporal data imputation, with publicly available source code for further use and development.

Abstract: Missing data in spatiotemporal systems presents a significant challenge for
modern applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to urban traffic
management. The integrity of spatiotemporal data often deteriorates due to
hardware malfunctions and software failures in real-world deployments. Current
approaches based on machine learning and deep learning struggle to model the
intricate interdependencies between spatial and temporal dimensions effectively
and, more importantly, suffer from cumulative errors during the data imputation
process, which propagate and amplify through iterations. To address these
limitations, we propose CoFILL, a novel Conditional Diffusion Model for
spatiotemporal data imputation. CoFILL builds on the inherent advantages of
diffusion models to generate high-quality imputations without relying on
potentially error-prone prior estimates. It incorporates an innovative
dual-stream architecture that processes temporal and frequency domain features
in parallel. By fusing these complementary features, CoFILL captures both rapid
fluctuations and underlying patterns in the data, which enables more robust
imputation. The extensive experiments reveal that CoFILL's noise prediction
network successfully transforms random noise into meaningful values that align
with the true data distribution. The results also show that CoFILL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/joyHJL/CoFILL.

### [501] [Towards Universal Offline Black-Box Optimization via Learning Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07109)
*Rong-Xi Tan,Ming Chen,Ke Xue,Yao Wang,Yaoyuan Wang,Sheng Fu,Chao Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using language model embeddings to unify representations for heterogeneous numerical spaces in offline black-box optimization (BBO), proposing methods like next-token prediction and latent space learning, validated on collected tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline BBO methods are limited to single-task, fixed-dimensional settings due to lack of unified representations. Language models offer a promising solution with their universal embeddings.

Method: Proposes end-to-end learning (next-token prediction) and latent space learning. Validates using collected offline BBO tasks and data.

Result: Experiments show universality and effectiveness, suggesting language model priors and string embeddings can overcome traditional BBO barriers.

Conclusion: Unifying language model priors with learning string embeddings enables general-purpose BBO algorithms, advancing universal optimization.

Abstract: The pursuit of universal black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms is a
longstanding goal. However, unlike domains such as language or vision, where
scaling structured data has driven generalization, progress in offline BBO
remains hindered by the lack of unified representations for heterogeneous
numerical spaces. Thus, existing offline BBO approaches are constrained to
single-task and fixed-dimensional settings, failing to achieve cross-domain
universal optimization. Recent advances in language models (LMs) offer a
promising path forward: their embeddings capture latent relationships in a
unifying way, enabling universal optimization across different data types
possible. In this paper, we discuss multiple potential approaches, including an
end-to-end learning framework in the form of next-token prediction, as well as
prioritizing the learning of latent spaces with strong representational
capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, we collect
offline BBO tasks and data from open-source academic works for training.
Experiments demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of our proposed
methods. Our findings suggest that unifying language model priors and learning
string embedding space can overcome traditional barriers in universal BBO,
paving the way for general-purpose BBO algorithms. The code is provided at

### [502] [Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming: Automated Generation of High-Quality and Diverse Attackers for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07121)
*Ren-Jian Wang,Ke Xue,Zeyu Qin,Ziniu Li,Sheng Tang,Hao-Tian Li,Shengcai Liu,Chao Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QDRT introduces a new red-teaming framework to enhance diversity and effectiveness in identifying adversarial prompts for LLM safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous red-teaming methods lack meaningful diversity and coverage due to simplistic metrics and single attacker models.

Method: QDRT uses behavior-conditioned training, a behavioral replay buffer, and multiple specialized attackers to achieve goal-driven diversity.

Result: QDRT generates more diverse and effective attacks across various LLMs like GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5.

Conclusion: QDRT advances LLM safety by improving automated red-teaming, supporting responsible deployment.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.

*Eshwar S. R.,Gugan Thoppe,Aditya Gopalan,Gal Dalal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI) is introduced to address the monotonicity collapse in RL with function approximation, offering guaranteed lower-bound value estimates and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of maintaining monotonic improvement in RL with function approximation, particularly in policy iteration, motivates the development of RPI.

Method: RPI replaces projection or Bellman-error minimization with Bellman-based constrained optimization during policy evaluation, ensuring monotonicity and lower-bound guarantees.

Result: RPI provides monotonic value estimates that lower bound the true return and partially satisfies the Bellman equation, outperforming baselines in control tasks.

Conclusion: RPI is the first algorithm with proven monotonicity and convergence under function approximation, enhancing practical RL implementations like DQN and DDPG.

Abstract: Despite decades of research, it remains challenging to correctly use
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with function approximation. A prime
example is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic
improvement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this
issue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common
projection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a
Bellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer
textbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower
bound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected
Bellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL. RPI is the first
algorithm with such monotonicity and convergence guarantees under function
approximation. For practical use, we provide a model-free variant of RPI that
amounts to a novel critic. It can be readily integrated into primary model-free
PI implementations such as DQN and DDPG. In classical control tasks, such
RPI-enhanced variants consistently maintain their lower-bound guarantee while
matching or surpassing the performance of all baseline methods.

TL;DR: AMoPO is a novel framework for multi-objective preference alignment in LLMs, dynamically balancing preference dimensions without auxiliary models, outperforming baselines by 28.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing methods: inability to balance preference dimensions and reliance on auxiliary models, which add complexity.

Method: Uses dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism modeling generation space as a Gaussian distribution.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, scales across 7B, 14B, and 32B models, and shows adaptability in multi-dimensional analysis.

Conclusion: AMoPO effectively aligns LLMs with diverse preferences, demonstrating superiority and scalability without additional models.

Abstract: Existing multi-objective preference alignment methods for large language
models (LLMs) face limitations: (1) the inability to effectively balance
various preference dimensions, and (2) reliance on auxiliary reward/reference
models introduces computational complexity. To address these challenges, we
propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel
framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By
introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the
dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with
diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We
introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation
space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference
dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B
models reveal the scaling ability of AMoPO. Moreover, additional analysis of
multiple dimensions verifies its adaptability and effectiveness. These findings
validate AMoPO's capability to achieve dimension-aware preference alignment,
highlighting its superiority. Our codes and datasets are available at

*Huanyi Xie,Lijie Hu,Lu Yu,Tianhao Huang,Longfei Li,Meng Li,Jun Zhou,Huan Wang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAGA is an efficient framework for TAG representation learning, reducing annotation costs by focusing on representative nodes and edges, and achieves high accuracy with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with TAGs due to complex textual data, and existing LLM-based methods require costly annotations or fine-tuning.

Method: GAGA annotates only representative nodes/edges, constructs an annotation graph, and uses a two-level alignment module to integrate it with the TAG.

Result: GAGA matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy with just 1% of data annotated.

Conclusion: GAGA is a cost-effective and efficient solution for TAG representation learning.

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAGL, a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning model for traffic prediction, combining Stochastic Shared Embedding and adaptive graph convolution to improve accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic forecasting either lack node embedding regularization or face scalability issues, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RAGL integrates Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution with a residual difference mechanism, and introduces the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO) for scalable graph convolution.

Result: RAGL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency on four large-scale traffic datasets.

Conclusion: RAGL effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering improved accuracy and scalability for traffic prediction.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical task in spatial-temporal forecasting with
broad applications in travel planning and urban management. Adaptive graph
convolution networks have emerged as mainstream solutions due to their ability
to learn node embeddings in a data-driven manner and capture complex latent
dependencies. However, existing adaptive graph learning methods for traffic
forecasting often either ignore the regularization of node embeddings, which
account for a significant proportion of model parameters, or face scalability
issues from expensive graph convolution operations. To address these
challenges, we propose a Regularized Adaptive Graph Learning (RAGL) model.
First, we introduce a regularized adaptive graph learning framework that
synergizes Stochastic Shared Embedding (SSE) and adaptive graph convolution via
a residual difference mechanism, achieving both embedding regularization and
noise suppression. Second, to ensure scalability on large road networks, we
develop the Efficient Cosine Operator (ECO), which performs graph convolution
based on the cosine similarity of regularized embeddings with linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world traffic
datasets show that RAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel learning approach using Neurovectors for tabular data processing, improving interpretability and efficiency with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional neural networks by introducing a more adaptable and explainable learning process using vector spaces.

Method: Neurovectors structure data in vector spaces using energy propagation for learning, creating dynamic knowledge representations.

Result: Competitive accuracy compared to standard machine learning and deep learning models, validated on UCI and Kaggle datasets.

Conclusion: Neurovectors offer a promising alternative to traditional methods, enhancing interpretability and adaptability in learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel learning approach based on Neurovectors, an
innovative paradigm that structures information through interconnected nodes
and vector relationships for tabular data processing. Unlike traditional
artificial neural networks that rely on weight adjustment through
backpropagation, Neurovectors encode information by structuring data in vector
spaces where energy propagation, rather than traditional weight updates, drives
the learning process, enabling a more adaptable and explainable learning
process. Our method generates dynamic representations of knowledge through
neurovectors, thereby improving both the interpretability and efficiency of the
predictive model. Experimental results using datasets from well-established
repositories such as the UCI machine learning repository and Kaggle are
reported both for classification and regression. To evaluate its performance,
we compare our approach with standard machine learning and deep learning
models, showing that Neurovectors achieve competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: GGBall introduces a hyperbolic framework for graph generation, combining HVQVAE and Riemannian flow matching to model complex latent distributions while preserving hyperbolic structure. It outperforms baselines in preserving topological hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating hierarchical graphs by leveraging hyperbolic geometry to capture exponential complexity.

Method: Combines Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder (HVQVAE) with Riemannian flow matching and introduces hyperbolic GNN/Transformer layers.

Result: Reduces degree MMD by over 75% on Community-Small and 40% on Ego-Small, showing improved hierarchy preservation.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry is a powerful foundation for generative modeling of hierarchical data.

Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental
challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential
complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for
graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern
generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder
(HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form
geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent
distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware
structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN
and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring
stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over
75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological
hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a
powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and
hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perception-R1, a method to enhance multimodal perception and reasoning in MLLMs by using a novel visual perception reward, outperforming existing RLVR methods with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods improve multimodal reasoning but neglect multimodal perception, a core requirement for complex reasoning. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes Perception-R1, which uses textual visual annotations from CoT trajectories and a judging LLM to assign visual perception rewards based on consistency.

Result: Perception-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks with only 1,442 training data.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances both perception and reasoning in MLLMs, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLMs regulate reasoning length during explicit structured reasoning, introducing a progress bar visualization and a method to reduce unnecessary steps, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing reasoning length in LLMs—avoiding both underthinking and overthinking—to optimize task performance.

Method: Introduces a progress bar visualization for reasoning dynamics and manipulates internal progress encoding to streamline reasoning steps.

Result: The 'overclocking' method reduces overthinking, enhances answer accuracy, and lowers inference latency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively optimizes reasoning length in LLMs, improving both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, techniques such as explicit structured reasoning have demonstrated
strong test-time scaling behavior by enforcing a separation between the model's
internal "thinking" process and the final response. A key factor influencing
answer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the
reasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the
task. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to
unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and
exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the
length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show
that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an
interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights
on the model's planning dynamics. Second, we manipulate the internal progress
encoding during inference to reduce unnecessary steps and generate a more
concise and decisive chain of thoughts. Our empirical results demonstrate that
this "overclocking" method mitigates overthinking, improves answer accuracy,
and reduces inference latency. Our code is publicly available.

Motivation: To improve ensemble quality by modeling particle interactions and increasing diversity.

Method: Dual optimization procedure linking distributional population loss with the approximate posterior.

Result: IBDR consistently outperforms baseline methods in VTAB-1K and language tasks.

Conclusion: IBDR is effective for real-world applications due to its robustness and particle diversity.

Abstract: We introduce Interactive Bayesian Distributional Robustness (IBDR), a novel
Bayesian inference framework that allows modeling the interactions between
particles, thereby enhancing ensemble quality through increased particle
diversity. IBDR is grounded in a generalized theoretical framework that
connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior,
motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional
robustness while fostering particle diversity. We evaluate IBDR's performance
against various baseline methods using the VTAB-1K benchmark and the common
reasoning language task. The results consistently show that IBDR outperforms
these baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPlus, an improved version of the Shampoo algorithm, addressing divergence, learning rate transfer, and parameter noise issues, achieving faster convergence than Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key limitations in the Shampoo optimization algorithm, such as divergence, computational inefficiency, and learning rate challenges, to improve neural network training.

Method: Proposes SPlus with three improvements: bounded updates for stability, shape-aware scaling for learning rate transfer, and iterate-averaging to reduce parameter noise.

Result: SPlus achieves validation performance of Adam in 44% of gradient steps and 62% of wallclock time across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: SPlus effectively optimizes neural networks, outperforming Adam in efficiency and stability.

Abstract: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network
optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and
alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we
find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached
for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a
historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in
across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.
Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across
network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large
parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks
faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed
Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language
modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different
stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation
performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock
time.

*Alex Clinton,Thomas Zeng,Yiding Chen,Xiaojin Zhu,Kirthevasan Kandasamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel reward mechanism using a two-sample test ensures truthful data sharing by incentivizing genuine contributions and discouraging fabrication, applicable beyond strong distributional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incentive schemes in data marketplaces are prone to manipulation, as agents may submit low-quality or fabricated data to maximize rewards. Existing solutions rely on unrealistic assumptions about data distributions.

Method: Develops reward mechanisms based on a two-sample test inspired by the Cramér-von Mises statistic, ensuring truthful reporting as a Nash equilibrium in Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings.

Result: The method relaxes key assumptions of prior work and is validated theoretically in canonical data sharing problems and empirically via simulations and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively promotes truthful data sharing by aligning incentives with genuine contributions, overcoming limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Modern data marketplaces and data sharing consortia increasingly rely on
incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute data. However, schemes
that reward agents based on the quantity of submitted data are vulnerable to
manipulation, as agents may submit fabricated or low-quality data to inflate
their rewards. Prior work has proposed comparing each agent's data against
others' to promote honesty: when others contribute genuine data, the best way
to minimize discrepancy is to do the same. Yet prior implementations of this
idea rely on very strong assumptions about the data distribution (e.g.
Gaussian), limiting their applicability. In this work, we develop reward
mechanisms based on a novel, two-sample test inspired by the Cram\'er-von Mises
statistic. Our methods strictly incentivize agents to submit more genuine data,
while disincentivizing data fabrication and other types of untruthful
reporting. We establish that truthful reporting constitutes a (possibly
approximate) Nash equilibrium in both Bayesian and prior-agnostic settings. We
theoretically instantiate our method in three canonical data sharing problems
and show that it relaxes key assumptions made by prior work. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our mechanism incentivizes truthful data sharing via

### [516] [Investigating the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Tailored Behavior Change Messaging: Connecting Contextual Bandit with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07275)
*Haochen Song,Dominik Hofer,Rania Islambouli,Laura Hawkins,Ananya Bhattacharjee,Meredith Franklin,Joseph Jay Williams*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining cMAB and LLMs personalizes physical activity interventions, outperforming standalone methods in a 7-day trial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of cMAB algorithms (large sample needs, overlooked psychological factors) by integrating LLMs for personalized messaging.

Method: Combines cMAB for intervention selection with LLMs for message personalization, testing four models (cMAB, LLM, cMABxLLM, RCT) over 7 days.

Result: Evaluated via step count and message acceptance, showing cMABxLLM's effectiveness in promoting physical activity.

Conclusion: LLM-based personalization complements cMAB adaptation, enhancing behavioral messaging for physical activity.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB)
algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by
delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However,
cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn
effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly
encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines
cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to
personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral
self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each
delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical
activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using
dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy,
social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants
receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone,
combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization
(RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework
to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the
complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in
promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce the tokenized linear bandit (TLB) and multi-armed bandit (TMAB),
variants of linear and stochastic multi-armed bandit problems inspired by LLM
decoding and alignment. In these problems, at each round $t \in [T]$, a user
submits a query (context), and the decision maker (DM) sequentially selects a
token irrevocably from a token set. Once the sequence is complete, the DM
observes a random utility from the user, whose expectation is presented by a
sequence function mapping the chosen token sequence to a nonnegative real value
that depends on the query.
  In both problems, we first show that learning is impossible without any
structure on the sequence function. We introduce a natural assumption,
diminishing distance with more commons (DDMC), and propose algorithms with
regret $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{O}(L\sqrt{T^{2/3}})$ for TLB and
TMAB, respectively. As a side product, we obtain an (almost) optimality of the
greedy decoding for LLM decoding algorithm under DDMC, which justifies the
unresaonable effectiveness of greedy decoding in several tasks. This also has
an immediate application to decoding-time LLM alignment, when the misaligned
utility can be represented as the frozen LLM's utility and a linearly
realizable latent function. We finally validate our algorithm's performance
empirically as well as verify our assumptions using synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVINET is a framework for open-world graph learning, addressing misclassification and out-of-distribution detection using Beta embedding and subjective logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning often assumes a closed-world setting, but real-world environments are open and noisy, requiring detection of misclassifications and novel classes.

Method: EVINET integrates Beta embedding with subjective logic, featuring Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection.

Result: EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods in in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: EVINET highlights the importance of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for robust open-world graph learning.

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often
studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known
a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment,
it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong
prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification
detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes,
i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning
Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by
integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes
two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and
Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple
metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification
detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity
of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection
and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph
learning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET.

Motivation: Address the computational challenge of fitting HMMs to real-world data by leveraging LLMs' in-context learning capabilities.

Method: Use pre-trained LLMs to model synthetic HMM-generated sequences via in-context learning, analyze scaling trends, and test on real-world animal decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: ICL in LLMs can effectively learn HMM-generated sequences, enhancing understanding of in-context learning and its utility for complex data analysis.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational tools for modeling sequential

predictive accuracy approaching the theoretical optimum. We uncover novel
scaling trends influenced by HMM properties, and offer theoretical conjectures
for these empirical observations. We also provide practical guidelines for
scientists on using ICL as a diagnostic tool for complex data. On real-world
animal decision-making tasks, ICL achieves competitive performance with models
designed by human experts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that ICL can learn and predict HMM-generated sequences$\unicode{x2013}$an
advance that deepens our understanding of in-context learning in LLMs and

*Yizhuo Chen,Chun-Fu,Chen,Hsiang Hsu,Shaohan Hu,Tarek Abdelzaher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PASS is a novel approach to protect private attributes in ML data by stochastically substituting samples, overcoming vulnerabilities in adversarial training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for protecting private attributes in ML data are vulnerable due to adversarial training weaknesses.

Method: PASS stochastically substitutes original samples with others using a novel loss function derived from information-theoretic objectives.

Result: PASS is effective and generalizable across diverse datasets (facial images, activity signals, voice recordings).

Conclusion: PASS provides a robust solution for utility-preserving private attribute protection in ML services.

Abstract: The growing Machine Learning (ML) services require extensive collections of
user data, which may inadvertently include people's private information
irrelevant to the services. Various studies have been proposed to protect
private attributes by removing them from the data while maintaining the
utilities of the data for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, as we theoretically
and empirically show in the paper, these methods reveal severe vulnerability
because of a common weakness rooted in their adversarial training based
strategies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach, PASS,
designed to stochastically substitute the original sample with another one
according to certain probabilities, which is trained with a novel loss function
soundly derived from information-theoretic objective defined for
utility-preserving private attributes protection. The comprehensive evaluation
of PASS on various datasets of different modalities, including facial images,
human activity sensory signals, and voice recording datasets, substantiates
PASS's effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PagedAttention integrated with PyTorch's FlexAttention to improve memory efficiency in LLMs during long-context inference, reducing latency and fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory inefficiencies and fragmentation in LLMs during long-context inference caused by monolithic KV cache allocations.

Method: Integrate PagedAttention with PyTorch's FlexAttention to optimize KV cache handling, implemented in IBM's FMS.

Result: Significantly reduced inference latency (linear growth with sequence length) and minimal incremental memory usage for long sequences.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for long-context model deployment, with open-sourced implementation for broader use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during
long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches.
In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's
FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated
with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model
Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data.
Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced
inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to
2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency
increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged
for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged
attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence
lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We
open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future
long-context model deployment.

TL;DR: A transformer-based model is designed to generate high-quality time-series data, addressing limited data access in security applications and improving ML workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited data access in security domains hinders ML model training, and existing synthesized data fails to enhance model performance.

Method: An efficient transformer-based generative framework is developed to synthesize time-series data.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, producing generalizable, high-quality samples across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer model effectively boosts ML workflows by generating realistic and useful synthetic data.

Abstract: Many security and network applications require having large datasets to train
the machine learning models. Limited data access is a well-known problem in the
security domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer models
to enlarge the size of data by synthesizing new samples, but the synthesized
samples don't improve the models over the real data. To address this issue, we
design an efficient transformer-based model as a generative framework to
generate time-series data, that can be used to boost the performance of
existing and new ML workflows. Our new transformer model achieves the SOTA
results. We style our model to be generalizable and work across different
datasets, and produce high-quality samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEF introduces a diffusion-augmented ensemble forecasting method to generate initial condition perturbations, improving long-term weather prediction accuracy and forecast distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perturbation methods are tailored for numerical weather prediction, limiting their use in machine learning-based weather forecasting, which lacks standardized stochastic models.

Method: A conditional diffusion model generates structured perturbations iteratively, with intuitive control via a guidance term, converting deterministic neural forecasting into stochastic systems.

Result: The method reduces long-term forecast errors and produces meaningful forecast distributions, validated on the ERA5 dataset with improved predictive performance and spread estimates.

Conclusion: DEF successfully bridges the gap in stochastic modeling for machine learning-based weather forecasting, offering enhanced accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: We present DEF (\textbf{\ul{D}}iffusion-augmented \textbf{\ul{E}}nsemble
\textbf{\ul{F}}orecasting), a novel approach for generating initial condition
perturbations. Modern approaches to initial condition perturbations are
primarily designed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers, limiting
their applicability in the rapidly growing field of machine learning for
weather prediction. Consequently, stochastic models in this domain are often
developed on a case-by-case basis. We demonstrate that a simple conditional
diffusion model can (1) generate meaningful structured perturbations, (2) be
applied iteratively, and (3) utilize a guidance term to intuitivey control the
level of perturbation. This method enables the transformation of any
deterministic neural forecasting system into a stochastic one. With our
stochastic extended systems, we show that the model accumulates less error over
long-term forecasts while producing meaningful forecast distributions. We
validate our approach on the 5.625$^\circ$ ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which
comprises atmospheric and surface variables over a discretized global grid,
spanning from the 1960s to the present. On this dataset, our method
demonstrates improved predictive performance along with reasonable spread
estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mobility-aware dynamic sparsification (MADS) algorithm for Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) to address challenges like gradient sparsification and model staleness caused by device mobility. MADS optimizes sparsification based on contact time and staleness, improving convergence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Device mobility in AFL causes intermittent connectivity, leading to gradient sparsification and model staleness, which hinder convergence. This work aims to analyze and mitigate these issues.

Method: The paper develops a theoretical model to study sparsification, staleness, and mobility's impact on AFL. It then proposes the MADS algorithm, which dynamically adjusts sparsification based on contact time and staleness.

Result: MADS improves image classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 8.76% and reduces trajectory prediction error on Argoverse by 9.46% compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: MADS effectively addresses AFL challenges under mobility, enhancing convergence and performance through dynamic sparsification.

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) enables distributed model training
across multiple mobile devices, allowing each device to independently update
its local model without waiting for others. However, device mobility introduces
intermittent connectivity, which necessitates gradient sparsification and leads
to model staleness, jointly affecting AFL convergence. This paper develops a
theoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model
staleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL
convergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic
sparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based
on contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing
that under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to
enhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the
sparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact
time. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings. Compared with the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, the MADS algorithm increases the image
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 8.76% and reduces the
average displacement error in the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by
9.46%.

TL;DR: JavelinGuard introduces low-cost, high-performance transformer-based architectures for detecting malicious intent in LLM interactions, optimized for production. It explores five models, with Raudra being the most robust, and benchmarks them against adversarial datasets and existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and accurate detection of malicious intent in LLM interactions, leveraging advances in compact transformer architectures for practical deployment.

Method: Systematic exploration of five transformer-based architectures (Sharanga, Mahendra, Vaishnava, Ashwina, Raudra), each with unique enhancements, benchmarked on nine adversarial datasets.

Result: Raudra's multi-task framework shows the most robust performance, but all models offer distinct trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides a guide for practitioners to choose the optimal model based on their specific needs for LLM security applications, balancing complexity and efficiency.

Abstract: We present JavelinGuard, a suite of low-cost, high-performance model
architectures designed for detecting malicious intent in Large Language Model
(LLM) interactions, optimized specifically for production deployment. Recent
advances in transformer architectures, including compact BERT(Devlin et al.
2019) variants (e.g., ModernBERT (Warner et al. 2024)), allow us to build
highly accurate classifiers with as few as approximately 400M parameters that
achieve rapid inference speeds even on standard CPU hardware. We systematically
explore five progressively sophisticated transformer-based architectures:
Sharanga (baseline transformer classifier), Mahendra (enhanced
attention-weighted pooling with deeper heads), Vaishnava and Ashwina (hybrid
neural ensemble architectures), and Raudra (an advanced multi-task framework
with specialized loss functions). Our models are rigorously benchmarked across
nine diverse adversarial datasets, including popular sets like the NotInject
series, BIPIA, Garak, ImprovedLLM, ToxicChat, WildGuard, and our newly
introduced JavelinBench, specifically crafted to test generalization on
challenging borderline and hard-negative cases. Additionally, we compare our
architectures against leading open-source guardrail models as well as large
decoder-only LLMs such as gpt-4o, demonstrating superior cost-performance
trade-offs in terms of accuracy, and latency. Our findings reveal that while
Raudra's multi-task design offers the most robust performance overall, each
architecture presents unique trade-offs in speed, interpretability, and
resource requirements, guiding practitioners in selecting the optimal balance
of complexity and efficiency for real-world LLM security applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-KV introduces a method to leverage structural inductive biases in LLMs by using KV-caches for selective attention, improving performance in tasks like RAG and graph-structured data reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs serialize input into flat sequences, limiting their ability to utilize structural dependencies in tasks like RAG and graph-based reasoning.

Method: Graph-KV uses KV-caches for condensed segment representations, selective attention, and graph-structured block masks, along with strategic positional encodings.

Result: Graph-KV outperforms baselines in RAG benchmarks, Arxiv-QA, and paper topic classification by reducing positional bias and leveraging structural biases.

Conclusion: Graph-KV effectively enhances LLM performance in structured tasks by addressing serialization limitations and optimizing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring
input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural
dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage
structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where
inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the
potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text
segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through
structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively
attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than
all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a
graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a
message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated
positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and
context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)
seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and
long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with
full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper
topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing
positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV
substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential
encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly
available.

TL;DR: SALT is a lightweight adaptation framework for Split Computing in closed environments, using client-side adapters to refine features without modifying proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting models in closed environments where head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible.

Method: Introduces a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to refine latent features from the head network.

Result: Improves accuracy with lower training latency on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and enables robust inference over lossy networks.

Conclusion: SALT provides a practical solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict constraints.

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model
adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the
head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such
closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they
require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this
challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to
refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation
without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We
evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared
to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for
robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud
environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical
solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system
constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-GPS optimizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) inference by selecting the best prediction strategy (Distribution-Only Prediction) to balance load and reduce overhead, improving performance by 23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing load imbalance in multi-GPU MoE networks caused by uneven token distribution among experts.

Method: Proposes MoE-GPS, a framework to evaluate and select optimal prediction strategies (e.g., Distribution-Only Prediction) for load balancing.

Result: Distribution-Only Prediction reduces overhead and improves inference performance by over 23% on Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset.

Conclusion: MoE-GPS effectively guides predictor design, enhancing system performance in MoE networks.

Abstract: In multi-GPU Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network, experts are distributed across
different GPUs, which creates load imbalance as each expert processes different
number of tokens. Recent works improve MoE inference load balance by
dynamically duplicating popular experts to more GPUs to process excessive
tokens, which requires predicting the distribution before routing. In this
paper, we discuss the tradeoff of prediction strategies, accuracies, overhead,
and end-to-end system performance. We propose MoE-GPS, a framework that guides
the selection of the optimal predictor design under various system
configurations, by quantifying the performance impact to system-level model
runtime. Specifically, we advocate for Distribution-Only Prediction, a
prediction strategy that only predicts overall token distribution which
significantly reduces overhead compared to the traditional Token-to-Expert
Prediction. On Mixtral 8x7B MMLU dataset, MoE-GPS suggests Distribution-Only
Prediction which improves end-to-end inference performance by more than 23%
compared with Token-to-Expert Prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Closed-Form Moment Alignment (CMA), a computationally efficient DG method aligning domain-level gradients and Hessians, unifying prior approaches and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing computational inefficiency and lack of theoretical understanding in existing DG methods that align gradients and Hessians.

Method: Develops a theory of moment alignment for DG, introduces CMA to align gradients and Hessians in closed-form, and validates it through experiments.

Result: CMA outperforms Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art DG algorithms in both linear probing and full fine-tuning settings.

Conclusion: Moment alignment unifies prior DG approaches, and CMA provides an efficient, theoretically grounded solution for domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well to
unseen target domains, addressing the prevalent issue of distribution shifts in
real-world applications. One line of research in DG focuses on aligning
domain-level gradients and Hessians to enhance generalization. However,
existing methods are computationally inefficient and the underlying principles
of these approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we develop the
theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in \textit{transfer measure}, a
principled framework for quantifying generalizability between two domains, we
first extend the definition of transfer measure to domain generalization that
includes multiple source domains and establish a target error bound. Then, we
prove that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measure both
when the feature extractor induces an invariant optimal predictor across
domains and when it does not. Notably, moment alignment provides a unifying
understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching, and Hessian
matching, three previously disconnected approaches to DG. We further connect
feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head, and establish the
duality between feature learning and classifier fitting. Building upon our
theory, we introduce \textbf{C}losed-Form \textbf{M}oment \textbf{A}lignment
(CMA), a novel DG algorithm that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in
closed-form. Our method overcomes the computational inefficiencies of existing
gradient and Hessian-based techniques by eliminating the need for repeated
backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation. We validate the efficacy
of our approach through two sets of experiments: linear probing and full
fine-tuning. CMA demonstrates superior performance in both settings compared to
Empirical Risk Minimization and state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric understanding of transformer attention and enhance efficiency by reducing parameters and addressing local inductive bias neglect.

Method: Uses metric tensors, tangent spaces, inner products, and parallel transport for attention. Reduces parameters via predefined configurations and introduces a mechanism to emphasize local neighborhoods.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances transformer efficiency and performance, with further evaluations planned for visual and language models.

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further
potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is
to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in
transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors,
tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These
quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected
via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process
more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined
configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a
neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers
inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that
our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the
baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will
be launched successively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods rely on strong assumptions; InverseScope aims to provide a more practical and scalable solution.

Method: Uses input inversion to define a distribution over inputs generating similar activations, with a novel conditional generation architecture for efficiency.

Result: Enables systematic, quantitative analysis of LLM representations, scaling to larger models and practical tasks.

Conclusion: InverseScope advances interpretability research by offering a scalable and assumption-light framework for analyzing LLM activations.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is
a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature
interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure
of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce
InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting
neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a
distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this
distribution to infer the encoded features. To address the inefficiency of
sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation
architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous
methods. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests
interpretability hypotheses using feature consistency rate computed over the
sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to
larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative
analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

*Yihong Jin,Ze Yang,Juntian Liu,Xinhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-based anomaly detection system for multi-cloud environments, improving accuracy and real-time response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring security and reliability in multi-cloud monitoring systems.

Method: Combines LLM's NLP with traditional ML for multi-level feature extraction and dynamic adaptation.

Result: Outperforms traditional systems in accuracy and latency, enhancing cloud resilience.

Conclusion: The model effectively improves anomaly detection and proactive management in multi-cloud setups.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly
important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring
systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning
mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on
Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring
framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature
extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of
LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing
the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts
to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more
effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures.
Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than
the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and
latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management
ability of cloud infrastructure.

### [533] [Fractional-order Jacobian Matrix Differentiation and Its Application in Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07408)
*Xiaojun zhou,Chunna Zhao,Yaqun Huang,Chengli Zhou,Junjie Ye,Kemeng Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fractional-order matrix differentiation method (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$) compatible with Autograd, enhancing fractional-order differentiation in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractional-order differentiation offers unique advantages for neural network optimization, but lacks compatibility with Autograd, limiting its practical use.

Method: Introduces ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$ based on integer-order Jacobian matrix, enabling fractional-order chain rule and Autograd integration. Implements FLinear in PyTorch.

Result: Experiments show ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$ outperforms traditional methods in training, validation, and test metrics, with efficient resource usage.

Conclusion: ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$ is a superior fractional-order gradient descent method, advancing deep learning applications.

Abstract: Fractional-order differentiation has many characteristics different from
integer-order differentiation. These characteristics can be applied to the
optimization algorithms of artificial neural networks to obtain better results.
However, due to insufficient theoretical research, at present, there is no
fractional-order matrix differentiation method that is perfectly compatible
with automatic differentiation (Autograd) technology. Therefore, we propose a
fractional-order matrix differentiation calculation method. This method is
introduced by the definition of the integer-order Jacobian matrix. We denote it
as fractional-order Jacobian matrix differentiation (${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$).
Through ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha }$, we can carry out the matrix-based
fractional-order chain rule. Based on the Linear module and the
fractional-order differentiation, we design the fractional-order Autograd
technology to enable the use of fractional-order differentiation in hidden
layers, thereby enhancing the practicality of fractional-order differentiation
in deep learning. In the experiment, according to the PyTorch framework, we
design fractional-order Linear (FLinear) and replace nn.Linear in the
multilayer perceptron with FLinear. Through the qualitative analysis of the
training set and validation set $Loss$, the quantitative analysis of the test
set indicators, and the analysis of time consumption and GPU memory usage
during model training, we verify the superior performance of ${{\bf{J}}^\alpha
}$ and prove that it is an excellent fractional-order gradient descent method
in the field of deep learning.

*Ziwen Wang,Jiajun Fan,Thao Nguyen,Heng Ji,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarCon improves contrastive learning by using variational inference for class-aware matching, achieving state-of-the-art results with clearer semantic organization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in contrastive learning: unregulated embedding distribution and reliance on large negatives/augmentations.

Method: Reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference, maximizing a posterior-weighted ELBO for efficient class-aware matching.

Result: Achieves 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, clearer decision boundaries, and superior few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: VarCon enhances contrastive learning with better control over embeddings, efficiency, and generalization.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

TL;DR: An efficient Vision-Language Model pipeline optimized for embedded devices, reducing latency by 2.5× (3.2× with FP8 quantization) without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time VLM deployment in resource-constrained environments like robotics and autonomous driving.

Method: Uses patch selection, token selection, and speculative decoding to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Achieves 2.5× latency reduction (3.2× with FP8 quantization) on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor.

Conclusion: The pipeline is a viable solution for real-time VLM in constrained settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline
specifically optimized for deployment on embedded devices, such as those used
in robotics and autonomous driving. The pipeline significantly reduces the
computational overhead by jointly leveraging patch selection to filter
irrelevant camera views, a token selection module to reduce input sequence
length for the LLM, and speculative decoding to accelerate token generation.
Evaluation on the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform for automonous driving
application, our pipeline achieves $2.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction
without compromising task accuracy. The speed-up further increases to
$3.2\times$ when applying FP8 post-training quantization. These results
demonstrate our pipeline as a viable solution for enabling real-time VLM
deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [536] [Evidential Spectrum-Aware Contrastive Learning for OOD Detection in Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07417)
*Nan Sun,Xixun Lin,Zhiheng Zhou,Yanmin Shang,Zhenlin Cheng,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EviSEC, an OOD detector for dynamic graphs using Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to address bias, variance, and score homogenization issues in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods for static graphs suffer from high bias/variance and score homogenization, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic graph scenarios.

Method: Proposes EviSEC, combining EDL with spectrum-aware contrastive learning to model uncertainty and generate OOD approximations.

Result: EviSEC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: EviSEC addresses key challenges in OOD detection for dynamic graphs, offering a robust solution with improved performance.

Abstract: Recently, Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in dynamic graphs, which aims
to identify whether incoming data deviates from the distribution of the
in-distribution (ID) training set, has garnered considerable attention in
security-sensitive fields. Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on
static graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high
variance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions
sensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from
the lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific
patterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID
and OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in
dynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).
Specifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via
Evidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural
network to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,
explaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,
which is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware
augmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high
OOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and
mitigating score homogenization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that EviSAC effectively detects OOD samples in dynamic graphs.

*Ruhan Wang,Zhiyong Wang,Chengkai Huang,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Lina Yao,John C. S. Lui,Dongruo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-ICL is a framework for improving in-context learning (ICL) in QA tasks by leveraging client-side data without transmitting model parameters, ensuring privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality examples for ICL are scarce due to privacy, cost, and distribution issues. Existing solutions either incur high communication overhead or underutilize local data.

Method: Fed-ICL uses an iterative, collaborative process between clients and a central server to refine responses without transmitting model parameters.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and experiments show strong performance with low communication costs.

Conclusion: Fed-ICL effectively enhances ICL for QA tasks while addressing privacy and efficiency challenges.

Abstract: For question-answering (QA) tasks, in-context learning (ICL) enables language
models to generate responses without modifying their parameters by leveraging
examples provided in the input. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily
depends on the availability of high-quality examples, which are often scarce
due to data privacy constraints, annotation costs, and distribution
disparities. A natural solution is to utilize examples stored on client
devices, but existing approaches either require transmitting model parameters -
incurring significant communication overhead - or fail to fully exploit local
datasets, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose
Federated In-Context Learning (Fed-ICL), a general framework that enhances ICL
through an iterative, collaborative process. Fed-ICL progressively refines
responses by leveraging multi-round interactions between clients and a central
server, improving answer quality without the need to transmit model parameters.
We establish theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Fed-ICL and conduct
extensive experiments on standard QA benchmarks, demonstrating that our
proposed approach achieves strong performance while maintaining low
communication costs.

*T. Duy Nguyen-Hien,Desi R. Ivanova,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Bayesian Modeling of Experiments to systematically address uncertainty in LLM deployments, enabling proactive steps like clarification requests or information retrieval, rather than just rejecting uncertain outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ensuring reliability in LLMs are limited to rejecting uncertain outputs, lacking tools to distinguish and respond to different uncertainty sources.

Method: Advocates for Bayesian Modeling of Experiments to reason about and manage uncertainty, allowing contextually appropriate actions like clarification or refinement.

Result: The framework enables more reliable, transparent, and applicable LLM systems by actively resolving uncertainty.

Conclusion: Adopting this approach can improve LLM reliability, especially in high-stakes settings, by moving from passive avoidance to active resolution of uncertainty.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are highly interactive and extendable,
current approaches to ensure reliability in deployments remain mostly limited
to rejecting outputs with high uncertainty in order to avoid misinformation.
This conservative strategy reflects the current lack of tools to systematically
distinguish and respond to different sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we
advocate for the adoption of Bayesian Modeling of Experiments -- a framework
that provides a coherent foundation to reason about uncertainty and clarify the
reducibility of uncertainty -- for managing and proactively addressing
uncertainty that arises in LLM deployments. This framework enables LLMs and
their users to take contextually appropriate steps, such as requesting
clarification, retrieving external information, or refining inputs. By
supporting active resolution rather than passive avoidance, it opens the door
to more reliable, transparent, and broadly applicable LLM systems, particularly
in high-stakes, real-world settings.

### [539] [When Style Breaks Safety: Defending Language Models Against Superficial Style Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07452)
*Yuxin Xiao,Sana Tonekaboni,Walter Gerych,Vinith Suriyakumar,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how style patterns in prompts affect LLM safety, showing they increase jailbreak success rates. It proposes SafeStyle, a defense method that improves safety during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if style patterns in prompts compromise LLM safety and how to mitigate such risks.

Method: Evaluated 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks, analyzed style pattern impact, and proposed SafeStyle for defense.

Result: Style patterns inflate jailbreak success rates; SafeStyle outperforms baselines in maintaining safety.

Conclusion: Style patterns increase LLM vulnerability, but SafeStyle effectively mitigates these risks during alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

*Ziwen Wang,Jiajun Fan,Ruihan Guo,Thao Nguyen,Heng Ji,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProteinZero introduces a reinforcement learning framework for protein design, improving success rates and diversity while reducing failure rates by 36%-48%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of protein generative models due to scarce high-quality datasets.

Method: Uses online reinforcement learning with efficient proxy reward models (ESM-fold, rapid ddG predictor) and diversity regularization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in structural accuracy, designability, stability, and diversity, with success rates over 90%.

Conclusion: Establishes a continuous self-improvement paradigm for protein design, enabling exploration of vast design space efficiently.

Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but
still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality
protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel
framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of
the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve
computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward
models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly
accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework
balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and
a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode
collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing
methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant
improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability,
and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure
rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like
ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates
exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL
run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days,
including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein
design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs,
opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.

*Jie Peng,Hongwei Yang,Jing Zhao,Hengji Dong,Hui He,Weizhe Zhang,Haoyu He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSC is a backdoor defense method that works without labeled data or specific training, using permutation invariance and quadratic mode connectivity to purify models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses require labeled data or specific training, limiting their use. TSC aims to address this gap.

Method: TSC leverages permutation invariance and quadratic mode connectivity to amplify loss on poisoned samples while preserving clean accuracy.

Result: TSC performs robustly in supervised learning and generalizes to self-supervised frameworks like SimCLR and CLIP.

Conclusion: TSC is a versatile and effective defense against backdoor attacks across learning paradigms.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious
behaviors are implanted during training. While existing defenses can
effectively purify compromised models, they typically require labeled data or
specific training procedures, making them difficult to apply beyond supervised
learning settings. Notably, recent studies have shown successful backdoor
attacks across various learning paradigms, highlighting a critical security
concern. To address this gap, we propose Two-stage Symmetry Connectivity (TSC),
a novel backdoor purification defense that operates independently of data
format and requires only a small fraction of clean samples. Through theoretical
analysis, we prove that by leveraging permutation invariance in neural networks
and quadratic mode connectivity, TSC amplifies the loss on poisoned samples
while maintaining bounded clean accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that TSC
achieves robust performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in
supervised learning scenarios. Furthermore, TSC generalizes to self-supervised
learning frameworks, such as SimCLR and CLIP, maintaining its strong defense
capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiePeng104/TSC.

*Mickel Liu,Liwei Jiang,Yancheng Liang,Simon Shaolei Du,Yejin Choi,Tim Althoff,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-RedTeam is an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm for LM safety alignment, where attacker and defender agents co-evolve, improving robustness and adversarial diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM safety alignment is reactive and disjoint, leading to outdated defenses. Self-RedTeam aims to enable dynamic co-adaptation for proactive safety training.

Method: Uses a two-player zero-sum game framework with alternating attacker/defender roles, adjudicated by a reward LM. Includes hidden Chain-of-Thought for private planning.

Result: Achieves higher adversarial diversity (+21.8% SBERT) and robustness (+65.5% on WildJailBreak) compared to static methods.

Conclusion: Proposes a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution, enabling scalable and autonomous LM safety improvement via MARL.

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

TL;DR: LeanHammer is the first domain-general hammer for Lean, combining neural premise selection with symbolic proof search to improve automated reasoning in proof assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating neural methods into practical verification workflows is challenging, and Lean lacks a hammer despite its popularity.

Method: LeanHammer uses a novel neural premise selection system, dynamically adapting to user contexts and combining with symbolic proof search.

Result: It solves 21% more goals than existing premise selectors and generalizes well across domains.

Conclusion: LeanHammer bridges neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, enhancing formal verification accessibility.

Abstract: Neural methods are transforming automated reasoning for proof assistants, yet
integrating these advances into practical verification workflows remains
challenging. Hammers are tools that interface with external automatic theorem
provers to automate tedious reasoning steps. They have dramatically improved
productivity in proof assistants, but the Lean proof assistant still does not
have a hammer despite its growing popularity. We present LeanHammer, the first
end-to-end domain-general hammer for Lean, built on a novel neural premise
selection system for a hammer in dependent type theory. Unlike existing Lean
premise selectors, our approach dynamically adapts to user-specific contexts
and combines with symbolic proof search and reconstruction to create a
practical hammer. With comprehensive evaluations, we show that our premise
selector enables LeanHammer to solve 21\% more goals relative to existing
premise selectors, and generalize well to diverse domains. Our work bridges the
gap between neural retrieval and symbolic reasoning, making formal verification
more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

*Xiangkun Hu,Lemin Kong,Tong He,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for sub-optimal regularization and introduces EXPO, an explicit preference optimization framework that avoids DPO's pitfalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF's complexity and DPO's limitations (sub-optimal regularization, counter-intuitive behaviors) motivate a simpler, more transparent alternative.

Method: EXPO introduces explicit regularization factors without reparameterization, avoiding DPO's issues.

Result: EXPO provably satisfies regularization goals and outperforms DPO variants empirically.

Conclusion: EXPO offers a transparent, effective alternative to DPO, addressing its limitations with provable benefits.

Abstract: The generated responses of large language models (LLMs) are often fine-tuned
to human preferences through a process called reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a
separate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM
policy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward
alternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many
offshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,
through the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an
\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the
minimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in
some real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless
subject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation
behaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which
they are based. To this end, we introduce an \textit{explicit} preference
optimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous
reparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely
posit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that
transparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably
satisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not. Empirical
results serve to corroborate our analyses and showcase the efficacy of EXPO.

*Shakir Yousefi,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Gumbel noise and a straight-through estimator to speed up training of Logic Gate Networks (LGNs), improve neuron utilization, and reduce the discretization gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks are computationally expensive, and LGNs, while efficient, suffer from slow training and unused gates, hindering deployment.

Method: Inject Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to implicitly regularize the Hessian, improving convergence.

Result: Achieves 4.5x faster training, 98% reduction in discretization gap, and 100% reduction in unused gates.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances LGN training efficiency and performance, making them more viable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous
existing benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy
consumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world
deployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates
for efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve
a simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,
almost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This
discretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance
drop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject
Gumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly
speed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization
gap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian
regularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train
networks $4.5 \times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap
by $98\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\%$.

*Libo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GoCE, a method to address long-range dependency loss in chain-of-model (CoM) by using a differentiable causal adjacency matrix and causal-masked attention. It outperforms baseline LLMs in capturing causal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of subchains in CoM losing long-range dependencies due to causal masking, blocking global context flow.

Method: Proposes GoCE, mapping token representations to a sparse causal adjacency matrix, using causal-masked attention and causal-MoE, with intervention consistency loss and self-evolution gate.

Result: GoCE improves transformer's ability to capture long-range causal dependencies and self-evolve, outperforming baseline LLMs on datasets like CLUTRR and CausalQA.

Conclusion: GoCE surpasses CoM in design and offers insights for future causal learning and adaptive improvement research.

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

### [547] [Reinforcement Learning via Implicit Imitation Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07505)
*Perry Dong,Alec M. Lessing,Annie S. Chen,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Data-Guided Noise (DGN), a method using prior data for exploration guidance in reinforcement learning, avoiding imitation learning pitfalls and achieving 2-3x performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior data like demonstrations are often used for initialization, but imitation learning can degrade long-term performance by misaligning with reward maximization.

Method: DGN uses prior data to guide exploration via policy noise, avoiding explicit behavior cloning constraints.

Result: DGN achieves 2-3x improvement over prior methods in seven simulated continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrations are better used for action exploration guidance rather than forcing specific actions, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of sample efficient reinforcement learning, where prior
data such as demonstrations are provided for initialization in lieu of a dense
reward signal. A natural approach is to incorporate an imitation learning
objective, either as regularization during training or to acquire a reference
policy. However, imitation learning objectives can ultimately degrade long-term
performance, as it does not directly align with reward maximization. In this
work, we propose to use prior data solely for guiding exploration via noise
added to the policy, sidestepping the need for explicit behavior cloning
constraints. The key insight in our framework, Data-Guided Noise (DGN), is that
demonstrations are most useful for identifying which actions should be
explored, rather than forcing the policy to take certain actions. Our approach

### [548] [Addressing Correlated Latent Exogenous Variables in Debiased Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07517)
*Shuqiang Zhang,Yuchao Zhang,Jinkun Chen,Haochen Sui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses selection bias in recommendation systems by proposing a likelihood maximization-based algorithm that handles latent exogenous variables, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selection bias in recommendation systems distorts user preferences, reducing accuracy and fairness. Existing debiasing methods assume independence of exogenous variables, which this work challenges.

Method: The authors propose a learning algorithm based on likelihood maximization, modeling data generation with latent exogenous variables and using a Monte Carlo algorithm for estimation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method's effectiveness in debiasing recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses selection bias by relaxing the independence assumption of exogenous variables, enhancing recommendation accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) aim to provide personalized content, but they
face a challenge in unbiased learning due to selection bias, where users only
interact with items they prefer. This bias leads to a distorted representation
of user preferences, which hinders the accuracy and fairness of
recommendations. To address the issue, various methods such as error imputation
based, inverse propensity scoring, and doubly robust techniques have been
developed. Despite the progress, from the structural causal model perspective,
previous debiasing methods in RS assume the independence of the exogenous
variables. In this paper, we release this assumption and propose a learning
algorithm based on likelihood maximization to learn a prediction model. We
first discuss the correlation and difference between unmeasured confounding and
our scenario, then we propose a unified method that effectively handles latent
exogenous variables. Specifically, our method models the data generation
process with latent exogenous variables under mild normality assumptions. We
then develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically estimate the likelihood
function. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and three real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is at

*Clément Bonet,Christophe Vauthier,Anna Korba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for gradient flows on probability distributions, using a Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, and applies it to transfer learning and dataset distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling data represented as probability distributions in machine learning, particularly for tasks like domain adaptation and dataset distillation.

Method: Represent classes as conditional distributions, model datasets as mixture distributions, and use WoW distance for gradient flows.

Result: Developed a tractable framework with WoW gradient flows and applied it successfully to transfer learning and dataset distillation.

Conclusion: The proposed WoW framework provides a powerful tool for gradient-based optimization on probability distributions, with practical applications in machine learning.

Abstract: Many applications in machine learning involve data represented as probability
distributions. The emergence of such data requires radically novel techniques
to design tractable gradient flows on probability distributions over this type
of (infinite-dimensional) objects. For instance, being able to flow labeled
datasets is a core task for applications ranging from domain adaptation to
transfer learning or dataset distillation. In this setting, we propose to
represent each class by the associated conditional distribution of features,
and to model the dataset as a mixture distribution supported on these classes
(which are themselves probability distributions), meaning that labeled datasets
can be seen as probability distributions over probability distributions. We
endow this space with a metric structure from optimal transport, namely the
Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance, derive a differential structure on
this space, and define WoW gradient flows. The latter enables to design
dynamics over this space that decrease a given objective functional. We apply
our framework to transfer learning and dataset distillation tasks, leveraging
our gradient flow construction as well as novel tractable functionals that take
the form of Maximum Mean Discrepancies with Sliced-Wasserstein based kernels
between probability distributions.

*Zhangchi Zhao,Jun Shu,Deyu Meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaKANs improve KANs by using a smaller meta-learner to generate weights, reducing trainable parameters and training costs while maintaining performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, offer interpretable function approximation but suffer from high parameter counts and training costs.

Method: Propose MetaKANs, a meta-learner to generate KAN weights, trained end-to-end for efficiency.

Result: MetaKANs achieve comparable or better performance with fewer parameters, validated on symbolic regression, PDE solving, and image classification.

Conclusion: MetaKANs enhance KAN scalability, reduce training costs, and narrow the gap with MLPs, offering a practical alternative.

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer a novel
framework for function approximation by replacing traditional neural network
weights with learnable univariate functions. This design demonstrates
significant potential as an efficient and interpretable alternative to
traditional MLPs. However, KANs are characterized by a substantially larger
number of trainable parameters, leading to challenges in memory efficiency and
higher training costs compared to MLPs. To address this limitation, we propose
to generate weights for KANs via a smaller meta-learner, called MetaKANs. By
training KANs and MetaKANs in an end-to-end differentiable manner, MetaKANs
achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters and maintaining promising interpretability.
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark tasks, including symbolic
regression, partial differential equation solving, and image classification,
demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaKANs in improving parameter efficiency and
memory usage. The proposed method provides an alternative technique for
training KANs, that allows for greater scalability and extensibility, and
narrows the training cost gap with MLPs stated in the original paper of KANs.

Result: Improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, surpassing GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Offers a robust solution for integrating specialized tools with LLMs in chemistry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising
capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated
pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical
expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that
synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from
basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset
curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both
effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and
evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search
(HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and
execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level
fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM
that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for
advanced chemical applications. All datasets and code are available at

*Florian Andreas Marwitz,Ralf Möller,Magnus Bender,Marcel Gehrke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using top-p states in Hidden Markov Models to speed up inference and reduce noise, achieving significant speedups with bounded error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is computationally expensive, especially in Hidden Markov Models, where all states are considered, leading to inefficiency and noise.

Method: The method involves using only the top-p states (most probable states with accumulated probability p) to denoise and speed up inference.

Result: Empirical results show speedups of at least an order of magnitude, with errors in total variation distance below 0.09.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy, with error bounds tied to p and the model's minimal mixing rate.

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving
expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state
space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible
probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and
increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose
to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states,
i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the
error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called
minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical
evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of
magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

*Tan Chen,Jintao Yan,Yuxuan Sun,Sheng Zhou,Zhisheng Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCGD, an algorithm optimizing federated learning by minimizing multi-level collective gradient divergence (CGD), improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity and bandwidth limitations in federated learning by focusing on collective gradient divergence rather than individual device properties.

Method: Proposes FedCGD, which balances weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) and sampling variance to minimize device-level and sample-level CGD.

Result: Increases CIFAR-10 classification accuracy by 4.2% while scheduling 41.8% fewer devices.

Conclusion: FedCGD effectively optimizes FL performance by reducing multi-level CGD, offering a practical solution for wireless networks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for multiple devices to
cooperatively train a model. When applied in wireless networks, two issues
consistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices
and limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling
strategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data
heterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that
the convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and
sample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers
to the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of
the individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper
bounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total
number of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the
device-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it
into the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution
and the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the
sum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within
polynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases
classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\% while scheduling
41.8\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing
sampling variance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIRA is a unified foundation model for medical time series, addressing challenges like irregular intervals and missing values, achieving 10% and 7% error reductions in forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing models in handling medical time series data due to irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling, and missing values.

Method: MIRA uses Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding, frequency-specific mixture-of-experts, and Neural ODE-based Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block.

Result: Reduces forecasting errors by 10% (out-of-distribution) and 7% (in-distribution) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MIRA sets a foundation for future medical time series research with its robust, pretrained framework.

Abstract: A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open
access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to
reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust
transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in
data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist
time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due
to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous
sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical
time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional
Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a
frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across
latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a
Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the
continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at
arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical
corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available
datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10%
and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when
compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a
comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks,
establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.

TL;DR: Proposes ATRADA, a Transformer-based framework for augmenting aircraft trajectory datasets using latent space modeling, PCA, GMM, and MLP to generate high-quality synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robustness of aircraft trajectory models for ATM tasks like conflict detection and landing time prediction by addressing dataset insufficiency and imbalance.

Method: Uses Transformer encoder for latent space representation, PCA for dimensionality reduction, GMM for probability fitting, and MLP for decoding synthetic samples.

Result: Effectively generates high-quality synthetic trajectory data, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: ATRADA provides a viable solution for dataset augmentation in aircraft trajectory modeling, improving model robustness.

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management
(ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict
detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the
addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a
more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is
sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework,
a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory
dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned
latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into
reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data
points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from
the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original
dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several
experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new,
high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the
results of several baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunePEFT optimizes PEFT strategy search by treating it as a pruning problem, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT methods reduce training costs but face challenges in design space configuration, leading to sub-optimal results. Conventional solutions add overhead.

Method: PrunePEFT uses a hybrid pruning strategy to iteratively remove redundant PEFT modules, optimizing configurations without extensive search.

Result: The approach significantly reduces computational burden while maintaining task performance comparable to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PrunePEFT offers a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large pre-trained models by leveraging pruning techniques.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as effective and
promising approaches for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. Compared with
Full parameter Fine-Tuning (FFT), PEFT achieved comparable task performance
with a substantial reduction of trainable parameters, which largely saved the
training and storage costs. However, using the PEFT method requires considering
a vast design space, such as the type of PEFT modules and their insertion
layers. Inadequate configurations can lead to sub-optimal results. Conventional
solutions such as architectural search techniques, while effective, tend to
introduce substantial additional overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach, PrunePEFT, which formulates the PEFT strategy search as a pruning
problem and introduces a hybrid pruning strategy that capitalizes on the
sensitivity of pruning methods to different PEFT modules. This method extends
traditional pruning techniques by iteratively removing redundant or conflicting
PEFT modules, thereby optimizing the fine-tuned configuration. By efficiently
identifying the most relevant modules, our approach significantly reduces the
computational burden typically associated with architectural search processes,
making it a more scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large
pre-trained models.

### [557] [Exploiting Curvature in Online Convex Optimization with Delayed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07595)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses online convex optimization with curved losses and delayed feedback, proposing algorithms to improve regret bounds compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for strongly convex or exp-concave losses with delayed feedback have suboptimal regret bounds, motivating the need for better algorithms.

Method: The authors propose variants of follow-the-regularized-leader and Online Newton Step with adaptive learning rates, and a modified Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth forecaster for unconstrained regression.

Result: The algorithms achieve improved regret bounds of order min{σ_max ln T, √d_tot} for strongly convex losses and min{d_max n ln T, √d_tot} for exp-concave losses.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform existing approaches, as demonstrated by experiments under various delays and loss types.

Abstract: In this work, we study the online convex optimization problem with curved
losses and delayed feedback. When losses are strongly convex, existing
approaches obtain regret bounds of order $d_{\max} \ln T$, where $d_{\max}$ is
the maximum delay and $T$ is the time horizon. However, in many cases, this
guarantee can be much worse than $\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a
delayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the
total delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of
follow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order
$\min\{\sigma_{\max}\ln T, \sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$, where $\sigma_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of missing observations. We then consider exp-concave losses
and extend the Online Newton Step algorithm to handle delays with an adaptive
learning rate tuning, achieving regret $\min\{d_{\max} n\ln T,
\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{tot}}}\}$ where $n$ is the dimension. To our knowledge, this
is the first algorithm to achieve such a regret bound for exp-concave losses.
We further consider the problem of unconstrained online linear regression and
achieve a similar guarantee by designing a variant of the Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth
forecaster with a clipping trick. Finally, we implement our algorithms and
conduct experiments under various types of delay and losses, showing an
improved performance over existing methods.

TL;DR: TwinBreak is a method to bypass LLM safety mechanisms by identifying and pruning safety-related parameters, achieving high success rates with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have social risks, as malicious users can exploit them via harmful prompts. Current jailbreak methods are inefficient or degrade model utility.

Method: TwinBreak analyzes intermediate outputs from structurally similar prompts to isolate and prune safety parameters, using the TwinPrompt dataset for validation.

Result: TwinBreak achieves 89% to 98% success rates in bypassing safety mechanisms across 16 LLMs with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: TwinBreak offers an efficient and effective solution for removing safety alignment in LLMs, highlighting vulnerabilities in current safeguards.

Abstract: Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.
Experiments confirm TwinBreak's effectiveness, achieving 89% to 98% success
rates with minimal computational requirements across 16 LLMs from five vendors.

TL;DR: FuXi-Air, a multimodal data fusion model, improves air quality forecasting in megacities by integrating meteorological, emission, and pollutant data, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of high computational costs and inefficiency in current air quality forecasting methods, the study aims to develop a low-cost, efficient model for smart urban management.

Method: FuXi-Air combines meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data using an autoregressive framework and frame interpolation strategy for 72-hour forecasts.

Result: The model achieves high-precision, 72-hour forecasts for six pollutants in 25-30 seconds, outperforming traditional numerical models in efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FuXi-Air demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal data integration for air quality forecasting, offering insights for hybrid systems in smart city pollution management.

Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a major public health challenge in megacities.
Numerical simulations and single-site machine learning approaches have been
widely applied in air quality forecasting tasks. However, these methods face
multiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational
efficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid
advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a
low-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.
An air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this
study based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality
forecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates
meteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data
under the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive
prediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model
successfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an
hourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In
terms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms
the mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.
Ablation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although
meteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories
do, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting
precision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing
pollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical
reference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to
air quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid
forecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city
management.

Motivation: Chemical datasets are often inaccessible or require cleaning, limiting ML applications in chemistry. This paper addresses the gap by providing a transient flow dataset.

Method: The dataset covers over 1200 process conditions, focusing on continuous parameters. Benchmarking includes regression, transfer learning, feature engineering, and active learning.

Result: The dataset enables ML benchmarking for solvent selection, a challenging task, with applications in sustainable manufacturing.

Conclusion: This work advances ML in chemistry by providing a unique dataset and demonstrating its utility for solvent replacement and sustainable processes.

Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory
chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and
reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to
the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough
understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever
transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200
process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our
experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process
conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on
solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically
and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking
for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering,
and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement
and sustainable manufacturing.

TL;DR: ChebNet, an early spectral GNN, is revisited and found to outperform MPNNs and Graph Transformers in long-range dependencies. A stable variant, Stable-ChebNet, is introduced to address training instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNNs and Graph Transformers struggle with long-range dependencies and computational efficiency. ChebNet's potential for addressing these issues is explored.

Method: ChebNet is analyzed for long-range modeling, and a stable variant, Stable-ChebNet, is developed by framing it as a stable dynamical system.

Result: ChebNet shows competitive performance on long-range benchmarks. Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art results without additional complexities.

Conclusion: Stable-ChebNet offers a scalable, stable solution for long-range dependencies, outperforming MPNNs and GTs without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: ChebNet, one of the earliest spectral GNNs, has largely been overshadowed by
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), which gained popularity for their
simplicity and effectiveness in capturing local graph structure. Despite their
success, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies
between nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make
use of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that
characterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically
disregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original
introduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant
node interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive
advantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while
maintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we
uncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime
during training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and
non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our
Stable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has
controllable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,
positional encodings, or graph rewiring. Across several benchmarks,
Stable-ChebNet achieves near state-of-the-art performance.

### [562] [The Universality Lens: Why Even Highly Over-Parametrized Models Learn Well](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07661)
*Meir Feder,Ruediger Urbanke,Yaniv Fogel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why over-parameterized models generalize well by analyzing regret through information theory, showing it depends on the 'weight' of hypotheses close to the true data-generating process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large models generalize despite having more parameters than training samples.

Method: Uses a Bayesian mixture learner with log-loss and uniform prior, analyzing regret via Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: Regret is determined by the cumulative probability of models close to the true process, not the hypothesis class size.

Conclusion: Simple models with large weight generalize better, explaining why over-parameterized models avoid overfitting; practical methods like SGD align with this theory.

Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,
over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend
to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number
of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,
grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian
mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive
hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the
overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability
of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the
true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the
weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those
with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex
models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a
rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often
avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to
concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient
descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,
enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine
learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical

### [563] [ProARD: progressive adversarial robustness distillation: provide wide range of robust students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07666)
*Seyedhamidreza Mousavi,Seyedali Mousavi,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProARD introduces a dynamic network for efficient adversarial robustness distillation, avoiding retraining for diverse student networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ARD methods require costly retraining for each student, increasing computational and environmental costs.

Method: ProARD uses a dynamic network with weight-sharing and a sampling mechanism to optimize a range of student networks.

Result: ProARD avoids retraining and supports diverse architectures, but random sampling fails for robust students.

Conclusion: ProARD offers a scalable solution for robust student networks, though improved sampling is needed.

Abstract: Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method
to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against
adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust
teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the
diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches
require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific
constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2
emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation
(ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that
supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without
requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on
dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in
each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider
the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network.
ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly
optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks.
However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for
all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required
to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each
iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

### [564] [How Benchmark Prediction from Fewer Data Misses the Mark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07673)
*Guanhua Zhang,Florian E. Dorner,Moritz Hardt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 11 benchmark prediction methods for efficient LLM evaluation, finding a strong baseline in random sampling with regression. It highlights the dependency on model similarity and introduces a new method for extrapolation, though gains are modest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of LLM evaluation drives the need for efficient methods to predict benchmark performance using smaller datasets.

Method: Systematically assess 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 benchmarks, comparing them to a random sampling baseline and introducing a new method for extrapolation.

Result: Random sampling with regression outperforms most existing methods. All methods depend on model similarity, failing for extrapolation. The new method improves over random sampling but remains modest.

Conclusion: Benchmark prediction struggles at the evaluation frontier, where new models with unknown capabilities are tested, limiting its practical utility.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting
interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets.
Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a
small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance
from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and
limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.
First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit
a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most
existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset
selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all
existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when
interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark
prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than
previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous
methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over
the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse
propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample
average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model
similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark
prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where
the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of robustness in latent diffusion models (LDMs) by proposing methods to measure and improve it, including novel data augmentation and a tailored evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDMs lack robustness, and this gap is not fully explored in research. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: 1. Measure LDM robustness without the text encoder. 2. Introduce data augmentation to reveal robustness issues. 3. Fine-tune Stable Diffusion models with Dreambooth. 4. Propose a tailored evaluation pipeline.

Result: Improved robustness in LDMs through fine-tuning and novel evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address robustness issues in LDMs, enhancing their performance across tasks.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks, including image generation and video synthesis. However, they
generally lack robustness, a limitation that remains not fully explored in
current research. In this paper, we propose several methods to address this
gap. First, we hypothesize that the robustness of LDMs primarily should be
measured without their text encoder, because if we take and explore the whole
architecture, the problems of image generator and text encoders wll be fused.
Second, we introduce novel data augmentation techniques designed to reveal
robustness shortcomings in LDMs when processing diverse textual prompts. We
then fine-tune Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion XL models using
Dreambooth, incorporating these proposed augmentation methods across multiple
tasks. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation pipeline specifically tailored to
assess the robustness of LDMs fine-tuned via Dreambooth.

*Haizhao Jing,Haokui Zhang,Zhenhao Shang,Rong Xiao,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeDG-Former integrates language-based semantic embedding and dynamic graph representation learning to improve neural architecture modeling, addressing limitations like hardware attribute neglect and static adjacency matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook hardware attributes and rely on static adjacency matrices, limiting practical applicability and encoding effectiveness.

Method: Proposes LeDG-Former, combining language embedding (using LLMs) and dynamic graph-based transformers for neural architecture modeling.

Result: Achieves SOTA on NNLQP benchmark, enables cross-hardware latency prediction, and excels on NAS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: LeDG-Former advances neural architecture representation learning by addressing key limitations and demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

*Seungho Baek,Taegeon Park,Jongchan Park,Seungjun Oh,Yusung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAS introduces a graph-based approach for subgoal selection in offline hierarchical reinforcement learning, outperforming traditional methods by using Temporal Distance Representation and Temporal Efficiency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline HRL methods struggle with long task horizons and lack effective state transition stitching.

Method: GAS formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem, clusters states into TDR space, and applies a shortest-path algorithm for subgoal sequences.

Result: GAS achieves superior performance, scoring 88.3 in critical tasks vs. prior 1.0.

Conclusion: GAS provides an efficient, graph-based solution for offline HRL, significantly improving task performance.

Abstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on
high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their
efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective
strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different
trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that
formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an
explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance
Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from
different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition
stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal
sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the
subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)
metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly
enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across
locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most
stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing
the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0. Our source code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel combinatorial algorithm for LDA topic model inference, offering faster convergence, interpretability guarantees, and better semantic quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and interpretable topic model inference in applications like social science and causal inference.

Method: A non-gradient-based, combinatorial approach for estimating topic models, ensuring logarithmic parallel computation time.

Result: Algorithms converge exponentially faster than existing LDA methods, with interpretability guarantees and superior semantic quality.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art LDA, neural, and LLM-based topic models, maintaining independence for causal inference.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Abstract: Generative AI technologies have demonstrated significant potential across
diverse applications. This study provides a comparative analysis of credit

leveraging generative AI. Our findings reveal that current generative AI models
fall short of matching the performance of traditional methods, regardless of

TL;DR: EMD-CFL, a one-shot clustering method for federated learning, uses Earth Mover's distance to address non-IID data issues, outperforming 16 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning struggles with non-IID data; clustered FL aims to improve performance by grouping similar clients.

Method: Proposes EMD-CFL, using Earth Mover's distance in embedding space for one-shot clustering.

Result: Demonstrates superior clustering performance compared to 16 baselines across challenging datasets.

Conclusion: EMD-CFL effectively addresses non-IID data in federated learning, offering a robust clustering solution.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used framework for machine learning in
distributed data environments where clients hold data that cannot be easily
centralised, such as for data protection reasons. FL, however, is known to be
vulnerable to non-IID data. Clustered FL addresses this issue by finding more
homogeneous clusters of clients. We propose a novel one-shot clustering method,
EMD-CFL, using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) between data distributions in
embedding space. We theoretically motivate the use of EMDs using results from
the domain adaptation literature and demonstrate empirically superior
clustering performance in extensive comparisons against 16 baselines and on a
range of challenging datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPSA, an adversarial attack method, and OPSA-AT, a defense strategy using conformal prediction, to enhance model robustness and uncertainty reliability in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in high-risk applications need robust defenses and reliable uncertainty estimates, as accuracy alone is insufficient.

Method: Developed OPSA attack to maximize model uncertainty without coverage guarantees and OPSA-AT defense integrating OPSA in a conformal training paradigm.

Result: OPSA increases uncertainty more than baselines; OPSA-AT improves robustness against OPSA and other attacks while maintaining reliable predictions.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of OPSA and OPSA-AT effectively enhances trustworthiness and resilience in deep learning for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in high-risk applications,
robust defenses against adversarial attacks and reliable performance guarantees
become paramount. Moreover, accuracy alone does not provide sufficient
assurance or reliable uncertainty estimates for these models. This study
advances adversarial training by leveraging principles from Conformal
Prediction. Specifically, we develop an adversarial attack method, termed OPSA
(OPtimal Size Attack), designed to reduce the efficiency of conformal
prediction at any significance level by maximizing model uncertainty without
requiring coverage guarantees. Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT
(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel
conformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA
attack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for
various defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly
enhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,
and maintains reliable prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
this integrated approach for developing trustworthy and resilient deep learning
models for safety-critical domains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A novel multi-view probabilistic method resolves spatial ambiguities in object-centric representations without viewpoint annotations, ensuring identifiability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-like reasoning requires modular object-centric representations, but spatial ambiguities (e.g., occlusions, view ambiguities) pose challenges.

Method: Introduces a multi-view probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture invariant content and disentangled viewpoint-level information.

Result: Validated on benchmarks and complex datasets, the method shows robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses spatial ambiguities and provides theoretical guarantees without needing viewpoint annotations.

Abstract: Modular object-centric representations are essential for *human-like

to occlusions and view ambiguities*. However, addressing challenges presents
both theoretical and practical difficulties. We introduce a novel multi-view
probabilistic approach that aggregates view-specific slots to capture

global *viewpoint-level* information. Unlike prior single-view methods, our
approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for
identifiability, and requires *no viewpoint annotations*. Extensive experiments
on standard benchmarks and novel complex datasets validate our method's
robustness and scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel consistency distillation method for offline reinforcement learning improves performance and speeds up inference by incorporating reward optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in decision-making tasks suffer from slow inference, and existing consistency models struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or complex training.

Method: Proposes a reward-optimized consistency distillation approach for offline reinforcement learning, enabling single-step generation with simpler training.

Result: Achieves an 8.7% performance improvement and up to 142x speedup in inference over diffusion models.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it a practical solution for decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making
tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While the
consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to
decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on
complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning
that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process.
Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance
and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and
long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup
over diffusion counterparts in inference time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how high-level symbolic knowledge can improve Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DMARL) by addressing challenges like privacy, communication, and performance, and extends formal tools for policy compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks often require multi-agent collaboration, but DMARL faces challenges like policy compatibility, privacy, and communication. Symbolic knowledge can help overcome these issues.

Method: The study extends formal tools for checking local policy compatibility and incorporates symbolic knowledge about temporal event evolution to expedite learning.

Result: Symbolic knowledge significantly speeds up learning in DMARL, and the extended formal tools enhance policy compatibility guarantees.

Conclusion: Symbolic knowledge and improved formal tools make DMARL more practical and efficient for real-world multi-agent tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a multi-token training method for LLMs to improve conceptual understanding, outperforming traditional next-token fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with coherent, high-level concept formation due to fragmented token-based learning, limiting human-like understanding.

Method: CAFT enables multi-token sequence learning during fine-tuning, fostering concept-aware learning without expensive pretraining.

Result: CAFT shows significant improvements in tasks like text summarization and protein design, democratizing multi-token benefits.

Conclusion: CAFT's effectiveness suggests broader implications for ML research, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

TL;DR: The paper explores Jarzynski reweighting for training Energy-Based Models (EBMs), addressing biases in traditional methods like contrastive divergence and score matching. It analyzes kernel choice and applies the technique to flow-based diffusion models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EBM training methods introduce biases, limiting accurate learning. The study aims to leverage Jarzynski reweighting to mitigate these issues and improve generative modeling.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, focusing on kernel choice. Applied to flow-based diffusion models (to reduce discretization errors) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (to correct contrastive divergence biases).

Result: Insights into kernel choice's impact on model performance, demonstrating Jarzynski reweighting's effectiveness in improving sample quality and reducing biases.

Conclusion: Jarzynski reweighting is a principled tool for generative learning, offering potential to enhance EBM training by addressing biases and optimizing kernel selection.

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative
modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need
to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex,
multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence
and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this
work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique
from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training
EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these
theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based
diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of
stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample
quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in
correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights
into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting
the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative
learning.

TL;DR: RR-GNN enhances GNN uncertainty quantification with graph-structured conformal prediction, ensuring minimal prediction sets and provable coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack robust uncertainty quantification in high-stakes domains, and existing CP methods are overly conservative or ignore graph topology.

Method: RR-GNN uses Graph-Structured Mondrian CP, Residual-Adaptive Nonconformity Scores, and Cross-Training Protocol to address these issues.

Result: Validated on 15 real-world graphs, RR-GNN outperforms CP baselines in efficiency without losing coverage.

Conclusion: RR-GNN provides a robust framework for uncertainty-aware GNN predictions, addressing graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational data but face
significant challenges in high-stakes domains due to unquantified uncertainty.
Conformal prediction (CP) offers statistical coverage guarantees, but existing
methods often produce overly conservative prediction intervals that fail to
account for graph heteroscedasticity and structural biases. While residual
reweighting CP variants address some of these limitations, they neglect graph
topology, cluster-specific uncertainties, and risk data leakage by reusing
training sets. To address these issues, we propose Residual Reweighted GNN
(RR-GNN), a framework designed to generate minimal prediction sets with
provable marginal coverage guarantees.
  RR-GNN introduces three major innovations to enhance prediction performance.
First, it employs Graph-Structured Mondrian CP to partition nodes or edges into
communities based on topological features, ensuring cluster-conditional
coverage that reflects heterogeneity. Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive
Nonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set
to estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals
according to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training
Protocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual
predictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.
We validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node
classification, regression, and edge weight prediction. Compared to CP
baselines, RR-GNN achieves improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods,
with no loss of coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze fairness generalization error in machine learning models, using information-theoretic bounds derived from the Efron-Stein inequality. It validates these bounds empirically and offers insights for improving fairness generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods lack formal guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen data. Overfitting in fairness loss is understudied compared to prediction performance.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework using information-theoretic techniques, specifically Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI), to derive tight fairness generalization bounds based on the Efron-Stein inequality.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the tightness and practical relevance of the proposed bounds across various fairness-aware learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights for designing algorithms that improve fairness generalization, addressing a critical gap in fairness-aware machine learning.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications
using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training
process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal
guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen
data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been
extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far
less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing
fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel
bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to
derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both
Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical
results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across
diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable
insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.

TL;DR: A lightweight Transformer model for blood glucose prediction in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is proposed, optimized for edge devices, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying predictive models on wearable devices due to computational constraints in T1D management.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OhioT1DM and DiaTrend datasets in glucose prediction and adverse event detection.

Conclusion: The model bridges high-performance modeling with practical deployment, offering an efficient T1D management solution.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous
monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous
glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive
models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory
constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential
Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating
the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential
processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term
dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized
for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced
loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic
events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend,
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap
between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a
reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

*Sigma Jahan,Mohammad Masudur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hessian-based analysis helps diagnose faults in attention-based models by identifying fragile regions and parameter interdependencies, outperforming gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing faults in large, complex attention-based models is challenging, and gradient-based methods may be insufficient.

Method: Empirical study using Hessian-derived insights (curvature and parameter interaction analysis) on three models (HAN, 3D-CNN, DistilBERT).

Result: Hessian-based metrics localize instability and fault sources more effectively than gradients alone.

Conclusion: Hessian-based analysis could significantly improve fault diagnosis in complex neural architectures, aiding debugging practices.

Abstract: As attention-based deep learning models scale in size and complexity,
diagnosing their faults becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we
conduct an empirical study to evaluate the potential of Hessian-based analysis
for diagnosing faults in attention-based models. Specifically, we use
Hessian-derived insights to identify fragile regions (via curvature analysis)
and parameter interdependencies (via parameter interaction analysis) within
attention mechanisms. Through experiments on three diverse models (HAN, 3D-CNN,
DistilBERT), we show that Hessian-based metrics can localize instability and
pinpoint fault sources more effectively than gradients alone. Our empirical
findings suggest that these metrics could significantly improve fault diagnosis
in complex neural architectures, potentially improving software debugging
practices.

*Rajat Rasal,Avinash Kori,Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Tian Xia,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for counterfactual image generation, addressing challenges like identity preservation and causal faithfulness. It leverages Pearlian causality for semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-encoding frameworks lack scalability and fidelity for counterfactual image editing, while diffusion models offer superior visual quality and perception alignment.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion-based framework integrating semantic representations via Pearlian causality, introducing spatial, semantic, and dynamic abduction mechanisms.

Result: The framework enables principled trade-offs between causal control and identity preservation, demonstrating improved fidelity in counterfactual image editing.

Conclusion: This work pioneers high-level semantic identity preservation in diffusion counterfactuals, advancing the field with a scalable and faithful approach.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Abstract: We construct four Schauder bases for the space $C[0,1]$, one using ReLU
functions, another using Softplus functions, and two more using sigmoidal
versions of the ReLU and Softplus functions. This establishes the existence of
a basis using these functions for the first time, and improves on the universal

*Sifan Wang,Zehao Dou,Tong-Rui Liu,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FunDiff is a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces, combining latent diffusion with a function autoencoder to handle continuous functions and incorporate physical priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting generative models to physical applications is challenging due to the complexity of continuous functions governed by physical laws.

Method: FunDiff uses a latent diffusion process and function autoencoder, enforcing physical priors via architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions.

Result: Theoretically, FunDiff achieves minimax optimality for density estimation in function spaces. Empirically, it generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: FunDiff effectively bridges generative modeling and physical applications, demonstrating practical success in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and
flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data
such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical
applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous
functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce
$\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function
spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder
architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate
continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly
incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural
constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples
satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax
optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that
diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable
regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff
across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical
results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high
fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and
low-resolution data. Code and datasets are publicly available at

*Kevin Rojas,Yuchen Zhu,Sichen Zhu,Felix X. -F. Ye,Molei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for multimodal diffusion models enables native generation of coupled data across modalities without relying on external preprocessing, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joint multimodal data generation rely on external preprocessing, which demands high accuracy and limits applications with sparse data.

Method: Proposes a framework for multimodal diffusion models with decoupled noise schedules for each modality, supporting unconditional and modality-conditioned generation.

Result: Empirically validated for text-image generation and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework lifts restrictions of external preprocessing, enabling flexible and accurate multimodal data generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

### [585] [Uncovering the Functional Roles of Nonlinearity in Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07919)
*Manuel Brenner,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks, finding minimal nonlinearity often optimal for simplicity, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks, identifying when it's necessary and what mechanisms it enables.

Method: Uses Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) to control nonlinearity, testing on classic sequence tasks and a real-world stimulus selection task.

Result: Minimal nonlinearity is sufficient and often optimal, yielding simpler, more robust, and interpretable models.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity, bridging dynamical systems theory with functional demands in recurrent networks.

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

*Vahid Balazadeh,Hamidreza Kamkari,Valentin Thomas,Benson Li,Junwei Ma,Jesse C. Cresswell,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalPFN is a transformer-based model for automated causal effect estimation from observational data, trained on simulated data and requiring no further tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual selection of causal estimators is labor-intensive and requires expertise; CausalPFN aims to automate this process.

Method: Uses a transformer trained on simulated data-generating processes to infer causal effects directly from raw observations.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC) and competitive real-world policy-making results.

Conclusion: CausalPFN provides a ready-to-use, automated solution for causal inference with calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is fundamental across
various applications. However, selecting an appropriate estimator from dozens
of specialized methods demands substantial manual effort and domain expertise.
We present CausalPFN, a single transformer that amortizes this workflow:
trained once on a large library of simulated data-generating processes that
satisfy ignorability, it infers causal effects for new observational datasets
out-of-the-box. CausalPFN combines ideas from Bayesian causal inference with
the large-scale training protocol of prior-fitted networks (PFNs), learning to
map raw observations directly to causal effects without any task-specific
adjustment. Our approach achieves superior average performance on heterogeneous
and average treatment effect estimation benchmarks (IHDP, Lalonde, ACIC).
Moreover, it shows competitive performance for real-world policy making on
uplift modeling tasks. CausalPFN provides calibrated uncertainty estimates to
support reliable decision-making based on Bayesian principles. This
ready-to-use model does not require any further training or tuning and takes a
step toward automated causal inference (https://github.com/vdblm/CausalPFN).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4) is a new SSM variant using redundant wavelet frames, offering stable diagonalization and fast kernel computation without low-rank approximations. It outperforms HiPPO-based SSMs in long-range tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dependency of SSMs on state matrix choice and initialization, leveraging wavelet frames for better performance.

Method: Introduces W4S4, a class of SSMs based on redundant wavelet frames, enabling stable diagonalization and efficient computation.

Result: W4S4 outperforms HiPPO-based SSMs in delay reconstruction, classification, and long-range modeling tasks.

Conclusion: W4S4 provides a scalable, efficient foundation for future deep SSM-based models, with structured wavelet-based initialization offering significant advantages.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful components for sequence
modeling, enabling efficient handling of long-range dependencies via linear
recurrence and convolutional computation. However, their effectiveness depends
heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we
build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new
variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant
wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel
computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both
theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS
retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based
SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.
Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction
tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming
that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state
dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS
provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep
SSM-based models.

*Amirreza Yasami,Mohammadali Tofigh,Mahdi Shahbakhti,Charles Robert Koch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIESMC is a physics-informed reinforcement learning method for constructing accurate driving cycles, outperforming MTB and MCB methods in error reduction and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate driving cycle construction is essential for vehicle design, fuel economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments.

Method: Uses a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework with Monte Carlo sampling to capture transient dynamics and ensure model fidelity.

Result: Achieves up to 57.3% and 10.5% error reduction compared to MTB and MCB methods, respectively, and is significantly faster.

Conclusion: PIESMC effectively replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, confirming its superiority in driving cycle construction.

Abstract: Accurate driving cycle construction is crucial for vehicle design, fuel
economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments. A generative
Physics-Informed Expected SARSA-Monte Carlo (PIESMC) approach that constructs
representative driving cycles by capturing transient dynamics, acceleration,
deceleration, idling, and road grade transitions while ensuring model fidelity
is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework
with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with
reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving
up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the
Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the
Markov-chain-based (MCB) method. Moreover, it is nearly an order of magnitude
faster than conventional techniques. Analyses of vehicle-specific power
distributions and wavelet-transformed frequency content further confirm its
ability to reproduce experimental central tendencies and variability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurvBESA, a novel ensemble model combining Beran estimators with self-attention, outperforms traditional methods by smoothing noisy survival predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability in ensemble-based survival analysis models caused by bootstrap sample variations.

Method: Combines Beran estimators with self-attention to adjust survival functions based on similarity to neighbors, using Huber's contamination model for simplified training.

Result: Numerical experiments show SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SurvBESA offers a robust solution for survival analysis with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Survival analysis predicts the time until an event of interest, such as
failure or death, but faces challenges due to censored data, where some events
remain unobserved. Ensemble-based models, like random survival forests and
gradient boosting, are widely used but can produce unstable predictions due to
variations in bootstrap samples. To address this, we propose SurvBESA (Survival
Beran Estimators Self-Attended), a novel ensemble model that combines Beran
estimators with a self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional methods,
SurvBESA applies self-attention to predicted survival functions, smoothing out
noise by adjusting each survival function based on its similarity to
neighboring survival functions. We also explore a special case using Huber's
contamination model to define attention weights, simplifying training to a
quadratic or linear optimization problem. Numerical experiments show that
SurvBESA outperforms state-of-the-art models. The implementation of SurvBESA is
publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeuriGym is introduced as a framework to evaluate LLM-generated heuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization, addressing gaps in current benchmarks. It uses iterative feedback and proposes the Quality-Yield Index (QYI) for performance measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods are inadequate, either relying on closed-ended questions or subjective comparisons, lacking rigor and consistency.

Method: HeuriGym allows LLMs to propose heuristics, receive feedback via code execution, and refine solutions iteratively. Nine models are tested across diverse domains.

Result: Top models score 0.6 on QYI, below the expert baseline of 1, revealing limitations in tool use, planning, and reasoning.

Conclusion: HeuriGym provides a rigorous benchmark to guide LLM development for realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.

*Kasimir Schulz,Kenneth Yeung,Kieran Evans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenBreak is a novel attack bypassing NLP protection models by exploiting tokenization, making models misclassify inputs while the target remains vulnerable. A defense strategy is also proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in NLP protection models (e.g., against prompt injection, toxic input) by exploiting tokenization strategies.

Method: Introduces TokenBreak, an attack manipulating input text to mislead classification models while keeping the target (e.g., LLMs) responsive.

Result: Demonstrates that models can be tricked into incorrect classifications due to tokenization, with vulnerability predictable by model family.

Conclusion: Proposes a defensive strategy to mitigate TokenBreak without retraining, highlighting the need for robust NLP protection.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used for text-related tasks such
as classification and generation. To complete these tasks, input data is first
tokenized from human-readable text into a format the model can understand,
enabling it to make inferences and understand context. Text classification
models can be implemented to guard against threats such as prompt injection
attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), toxic input and cybersecurity
risks such as spam emails. In this paper, we introduce TokenBreak: a novel
attack that can bypass these protection models by taking advantage of the
tokenization strategy they use. This attack technique manipulates input text in
such a way that certain models give an incorrect classification. Importantly,
the end target (LLM or email recipient) can still understand and respond to the
manipulated text and therefore be vulnerable to the very attack the protection
model was put in place to prevent. The tokenizer is tied to model architecture,
meaning it is possible to predict whether or not a model is vulnerable to
attack based on family. We also present a defensive strategy as an added layer
of protection that can be implemented without having to retrain the defensive
model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces cost-aware methods to balance cheap but inaccurate weak raters (e.g., model-based autoraters) with expensive but accurate strong raters (e.g., humans) for efficient AI system evaluation under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time of continual evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation in generative AI systems necessitate cost-effective solutions, especially when relying on synthetic data introduces bias.

Method: The authors derive cost-optimal policies for budget allocation between weak and strong raters, leveraging active and prediction-powered statistical inference to maximize statistical efficiency.

Result: Empirical tests show the policies outperform prior methods, especially in tasks with high variability in example difficulty, achieving the same precision at lower costs.

Conclusion: The proposed cost-aware policies offer a practical solution for efficient and unbiased evaluation of generative AI systems under budget constraints.

Abstract: The development lifecycle of generative AI systems requires continual
evaluation, data acquisition, and annotation, which is costly in both resources
and time. In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on
synthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for
substantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for
actively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such
as a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality
of generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong
rater alternative such as a human. More specifically, the goal of our approach
is to produce a low variance, unbiased estimate of the mean of the target
"strong" rating, subject to some total annotation budget. Building on recent
work in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family
of cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak
and strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and
real-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these
policies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in
tasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our
policies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total
annotation budget than standard evaluation methods.

uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically,
POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a

with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that
make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the training dynamics and convergence behavior of Chebyshev-based Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (cPIKANs) using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, revealing insights into kernel evolution and learning efficiency for PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance theoretical understanding of cPIKANs, which are promising for solving PDEs but lack explored training dynamics and convergence behavior.

Method: Derived NTK for cKANs in supervised settings, extended to physics-informed contexts, and analyzed spectral properties (eigenvalue distributions, spectral bias) for four PDEs. Investigated optimization strategies' impact.

Result: NTK behavior in cPIKANs is tractable, revealing learning dynamics beyond standard PINNs. Spectral trends link kernel behavior to convergence rates, showing when domain decomposition aids training.

Conclusion: This first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs provides theoretical insights that clarify and predict their empirical performance, bridging gaps in understanding.

Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their
Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training
dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically
and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding
of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our
objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout
gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We
first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend
the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral
properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and
spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz
equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations
governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation
into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,
second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the
resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in
the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also
reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel
behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing
theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.

TL;DR: ShockCast is a two-phase ML method for modeling high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping, addressing challenges like shock waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies focus on low-speed flows, but high-speed flows (e.g., supersonic) require adaptive time-stepping due to sudden changes like shock waves.

Method: ShockCast uses ML to predict timestep size (phase 1) and advances the system state using the predicted timestep (phase 2), incorporating neural ODE and Mixture of Experts concepts.

Result: Evaluated on supersonic flow datasets, ShockCast is the first framework for learning high-speed flows, with code and datasets publicly available.

Conclusion: ShockCast effectively models high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping, balancing resolution and computational cost.

Abstract: We consider the problem of modeling high-speed flows using machine learning
methods. While most prior studies focus on low-speed fluid flows in which
uniform time-stepping is practical, flows approaching and exceeding the speed
of sound exhibit sudden changes such as shock waves. In such cases, it is
essential to use adaptive time-stepping methods to allow a temporal resolution
sufficient to resolve these phenomena while simultaneously balancing
computational costs. Here, we propose a two-phase machine learning method,
known as ShockCast, to model high-speed flows with adaptive time-stepping. In
the first phase, we propose to employ a machine learning model to predict the
timestep size. In the second phase, the predicted timestep is used as an input
along with the current fluid fields to advance the system state by the
predicted timestep. We explore several physically-motivated components for
timestep prediction and introduce timestep conditioning strategies inspired by
neural ODE and Mixture of Experts. As ShockCast is the first framework for
learning high-speed flows, we evaluate our methods by generating two supersonic
flow datasets, available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/divelab. Our code
is publicly available as part of the AIRS library

### [596] [Hyperpruning: Efficient Search through Pruned Variants of Recurrent Neural Networks Leveraging Lyapunov Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07975)
*Caleb Zheng,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'hyperpruning', a method to find optimal pruning strategies for RNNs using a Lyapunov Spectrum-based metric, reducing search time and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost and lack of early guarantees in exhaustive pruning configuration searches for RNNs.

Method: Proposes a Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric for early performance prediction, integrated into a hyperpruning framework (LSH).

Result: LSH reduces search time significantly and identifies pruned models that outperform both baseline methods and dense networks.

Conclusion: LSH is an efficient and effective framework for hyperpruning, achieving superior performance with reduced computational effort.

Abstract: A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized
Recurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption
and storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed
`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for
a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional
hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains
uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model
sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to
discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.
However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally
expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early
comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of
post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard
hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning
framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an
order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full
training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn
Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under
fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies
superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform
those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their
dense counterpart.

*Junhong Shen,Hao Bai,Lunjun Zhang,Yifei Zhou,Amrith Setlur,Shengbang Tong,Diego Caples,Nan Jiang,Tong Zhang,Ameet Talwalkar,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes scaling test-time interaction (TTI) to enhance agent adaptability and performance, introducing a curriculum-based RL approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on web benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods lack adaptability and real-time interaction, limiting agent performance in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduces TTI, a curriculum-based online RL approach, using adaptive rollout lengths and a Gemma 3 12B model.

Result: TTI improves task success on web benchmarks and balances exploration-exploitation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Interaction scaling is a powerful complement to per-step compute scaling, enabling adaptive agent training.

Abstract: The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning
traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that
require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before
acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new
information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this
work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of
test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable
running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic
re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling
dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even
prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task
success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI
(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.
Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data
web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI
enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results
establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling
per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DesRUTGe is a decentralized framework using DRL and DFL to generate realistic urban traffic patterns, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic urban traffic simulation is crucial for sustainable planning and intelligent transportation, but current methods lack accuracy, scalability, or privacy.

Method: Integrates DRL agents with SUMO and employs DFL, where traffic detectors act as independent nodes, training locally and collaborating peer-to-peer.

Result: Outperforms standard SUMO tools and centralized approaches, validated with real-world Barcelona data.

Conclusion: DesRUTGe offers a scalable, accurate, and privacy-preserving solution for urban traffic simulation.

Abstract: Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban
planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However,
generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect
real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major
challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy,
scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This
work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a
novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with
the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key
innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL),
wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an
independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal
historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging
model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones),
without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from
the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as
RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering
more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.

*Boya Zeng,Yida Yin,Zhiqiu Xu,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current generative models for synthesizing neural network weights largely memorize training checkpoints, failing to produce novel or high-performing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of generative models to synthesize novel and effective neural network weights.

Method: Examination of four representative methods for weight generation, comparing their outputs to training checkpoints and simple baselines.

Result: Methods produce replicas or interpolations of training data, underperforming simple baselines like noise addition or weight ensembles.

Conclusion: Generative models for weights currently rely on memorization, highlighting the need for better evaluation in new domains.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact
submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local
functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph.
However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by
communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized
Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local
variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise
allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian
projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization,
matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we
explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a
function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT
performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication
bottlenecks and computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper extends the study of minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions to continuous and discrete domains, proposing a novel DC Algorithm (DCA) variant with strong theoretical guarantees and practical outperformance in applications like integer compressive sensing and least squares.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submodular functions are widely applicable, but prior work focused on set functions. This paper aims to generalize DS minimization to broader domains.

Method: Extends DS minimization to continuous and discrete domains, proposes a DCA variant for the resulting DC Program, and applies it via discretization for continuous cases.

Result: The method shows comparable theoretical guarantees to set function cases and outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and least squares.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generalizes DS minimization, offering practical and theoretical advancements.

Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in
numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two
submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted
to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth
functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that
DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC)
functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC
Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable
theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be
applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer
least squares.

### [603] [Improving choice model specification using reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06410)
*Gabriel Nova,Sander van Cranenburgh,Stephane Hess*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework is introduced to automate and improve discrete choice model specification, overcoming limitations of traditional metaheuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trial-and-error model specification in discrete choice modelling is expertise-intensive, time-consuming, and subjective. Metaheuristics fail to adapt dynamically or transfer knowledge.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning agent specifies models, receives rewards based on goodness-of-fit and parsimony, and dynamically adapts strategies.

Result: The agent successfully identifies promising model specifications across data generation processes, showing robustness and transferability without prior domain knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework automates and enhances model specification, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for discrete choice modelling.

Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for
understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights,
modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to
discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process
requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical
assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice
modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem,
relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting
outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics
struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically,
and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations,
we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent'
specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on
goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts
its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation
processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior
domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sampling efficiency from strongly log-concave distributions by improving the convergence rate of Langevin dynamics discretizations.

Method: Uses Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics.

Result: Achieves cubic speedup in accuracy dependence and demonstrates superior $W_2$ convergence complexity, especially for underdamped Langevin dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, offering significant computational advantages for sampling tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over
$\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the
randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We
prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic
speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the
Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized
midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we
demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the
complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in
the literature.

TL;DR: The paper explores using private GPTs to generate executable test code from requirements, comparing direct code generation with an intermediate Gherkin syntax step. The two-step method yields better results in readability and coding practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable product owners and business intelligence to directly produce testable criteria using LLMs, improving efficiency in modern development processes.

Method: Evaluates two approaches: direct code generation from requirements and an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. Tests are assessed for quality in terms of readability and coding practices.

Result: The two-step procedure (using Gherkin syntax) produces better test outputs in terms of human readability and adherence to coding best practices.

Conclusion: Structured prompts, especially with an intermediate Gherkin step, enhance the quality of automatically generated test code.

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to
automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More
specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics,
or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This
gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly
produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of
the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code
from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a
result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where
we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e.
lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.
Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple
"Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured
prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses refactoring challenges in quantum programming by developing a taxonomy for Qiskit migrations, comparing expert and LLM-generated taxonomies, and unifying them to aid future AI-assisted refactoring research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum programming libraries evolve rapidly, breaking code and requiring refactoring, which differs from classical software challenges. This study aims to systematize these issues.

Method: The study uses LLMs to categorize refactoring needs in Qiskit migrations, comparing expert and LLM-generated taxonomies, and integrates them into a unified framework.

Result: Two taxonomies (expert and LLM-generated) were compared and merged into a unified taxonomy, aiding future research and improving quantum software workflows.

Conclusion: The unified taxonomy supports AI-assisted refactoring research, enhances quantum software engineering workflows, and promotes best practices in quantum programming.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum programming libraries' heterogeneity
and steady evolution create new challenges for software developers. Frequent
updates in software libraries break working code that needs to be refactored,
thus adding complexity to an already complex landscape. These refactoring
challenges are, in many cases, fundamentally different from those known in
classical software engineering due to the nature of quantum computing software.
This study addresses these challenges by developing a taxonomy of quantum
circuit's refactoring problems, providing a structured framework to analyze and
compare different refactoring approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
proven valuable tools for classic software development, yet their value in
quantum software engineering remains unexplored. This study uses LLMs to
categorize refactoring needs in migration scenarios between different Qiskit
versions. Qiskit documentation and release notes were scrutinized to create an
initial taxonomy of refactoring required for migrating between Qiskit releases.
Two taxonomies were produced: one by expert developers and one by an LLM. These
taxonomies were compared, analyzing differences and similarities, and were
integrated into a unified taxonomy that reflects the findings of both methods.
By systematically categorizing refactoring challenges in Qiskit, the unified
taxonomy is a foundation for future research on AI-assisted migration while
enabling a more rigorous evaluation of automated refactoring techniques.
Additionally, this work contributes to quantum software engineering (QSE) by
enhancing software development workflows, improving language compatibility, and
promoting best practices in quantum programming.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IntenTest is a framework for testing LLM agents by generating realistic tasks and mutations to uncover intent integrity violations, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often misinterpret user intent due to evolving toolkits, and traditional testing fails to handle natural language ambiguity.

Method: IntenTest uses semantic partitioning, targeted mutations, and a datatype-aware strategy memory to test LLM agents systematically.

Result: Experiments show IntenTest uncovers more errors efficiently and generalizes well to stronger models and evolving APIs.

Conclusion: IntenTest effectively addresses intent integrity violations in LLM agents, offering a scalable and adaptable testing solution.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking
APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer
from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that
diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.
Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in
handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an
API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent
integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed
benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on
toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent
errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic
partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories
based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each
partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that
estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,
IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts
effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs
demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,
significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query
efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models
using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across
domains.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the cost-effective operation of Power-to-Gas (P2G) systems, addressing challenges like delayed rewards and long-term storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2G systems face inefficiencies and unclear benefits compared to batteries, and DRL struggles with delayed rewards in long-term operation.

Method: The study applies DRL algorithms (Deep Q-Networks, Proximal Policy Optimization) to P2G systems combined with BESs and gas turbines, introducing modifications like forecast integration and reward penalties.

Result: Proposed DRL adjustments improve cost-effective operation strategies, enhancing P2G's long-term storage potential.

Conclusion: DRL, with tailored modifications, can effectively manage P2G systems, unlocking their long-term energy storage capabilities.

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration
of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids.
However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is
complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and
loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing
energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of
converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of
energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face
difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.
Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the
energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of
P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be
applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and
gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex
case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep
Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to
enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,
implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost
calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our
findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex
decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose
significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation
strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainties in port-Hamiltonian systems while preserving structure, leveraging data-assisted control and reinforcement learning for robust and interpretable solutions.

Method: Dynamic decomposition into Hamiltonian and dissipative flows, with nonlinear control for the former and RL for the latter, linked by a virtual port variable.

Result: Effective uncertainty management, adjustable performance, enhanced explainability, safety guarantees, reduced learning complexity, and improved state estimation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, interpretable, and modular solution for port-Hamiltonian systems, validated through simulations and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for
port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition
based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two
parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow
handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a
dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties.
A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two
components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,
determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for
providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This
hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the
system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via
LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability
through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state
attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning
hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved
state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to
address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$
formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller
architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness
analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical
investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is
simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits
for future research.

*Armin Lederer,Erfaun Noorani,Andreas Krause*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A novel risk-sensitive safety filter for multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics is proposed, using control barrier functions and exponential risk operators to ensure robustness. Distributed strategies are introduced, and numerical evaluations confirm its efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring safety in multi-agent systems where centralized coordination is impractical.

Method: Leverages control barrier functions (CBFs) and exponential risk operators for robustness. Introduces two distributed strategies: worst-case anticipation and proximity to a known safe policy.

Result: Numerical evaluations show the approach maintains safety without excessive conservatism.

Conclusion: The proposed safety filter effectively ensures safety in uncertain multi-agent systems through adaptable distributed strategies.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge,
particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this
work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time
multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier
functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on
centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk
operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a
distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative
strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a
known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility
can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly
conservative.

TL;DR: KRAMABENCH is a benchmark of 104 real-world data science pipelines to evaluate AI systems' end-to-end capabilities in data processing, showing current models fall short in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI systems' ability to design and execute complex data science pipelines, which require domain knowledge and technical expertise.

Method: Introduces KRAMABENCH with 104 pipelines across 6 domains, evaluating 5 general and 3 code generation models using the DS-GURU framework.

Result: Models perform well on well-specified tasks but struggle with extensive data processing and domain knowledge.

Conclusion: Progress on KRAMABENCH is key for developing autonomous data science agents, though current models need improvement.

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data
extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources,
and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and
implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical
expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable
reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear
to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and
execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark
composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning
1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these
pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing,
requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing,
statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a
high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation
models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to
decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and
synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on
KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving
well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data
processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data
science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on
KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science
agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are

### [615] [HyColor: An Efficient Heuristic Algorithm for Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07373)
*Enqiang Zhu,Yu Zhang,Haopeng Sun,Ziqi Wei,Witold Pedrycz,Chanjuan Liu,Jin Xu*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: HyColor, a hybrid heuristic algorithm for the graph coloring problem (GCP), excels in large-scale sparse graphs and small dense graphs by combining local decision, graph-reduction, and greedy heuristic strategies. It outperforms existing algorithms in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCP algorithms focus on small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs, leaving a gap for a versatile solution. HyColor aims to bridge this gap by efficiently handling both types of graphs.

Method: HyColor uses a local decision strategy to improve chromatic number bounds, a graph-reduction strategy to simplify the graph, and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic for coloring.

Result: HyColor outperformed three state-of-the-art algorithms in 194 out of 209 instances, achieving optimal coloring in 128 cases.

Conclusion: HyColor is a highly effective and efficient solution for GCP, demonstrating superior performance across diverse graph types.

Abstract: The graph coloring problem (GCP) is a classic combinatorial optimization
problem that aims to find the minimum number of colors assigned to vertices of
a graph such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. GCP has been
extensively studied by researchers from various fields, including mathematics,
computer science, and biological science. Due to the NP-hard nature, many
heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve GCP. However, existing GCP
algorithms focus on either small hard graphs or large-scale sparse graphs (with
up to 10^7 vertices). This paper presents an efficient hybrid heuristic
algorithm for GCP, named HyColor, which excels in handling large-scale sparse
graphs while achieving impressive results on small dense graphs. The efficiency
of HyColor comes from the following three aspects: a local decision strategy to
improve the lower bound on the chromatic number; a graph-reduction strategy to
reduce the working graph; and a k-core and mixed degree-based greedy heuristic
for efficiently coloring graphs. HyColor is evaluated against three
state-of-the-art GCP algorithms across four benchmarks, comprising three
large-scale sparse graph benchmarks and one small dense graph benchmark,
totaling 209 instances. The results demonstrate that HyColor consistently
outperforms existing heuristic algorithms in both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency for the majority of instances. Notably, HyColor
achieved the best solutions in 194 instances (over 93%), with 34 of these
solutions significantly surpassing those of other algorithms. Furthermore,
HyColor successfully determined the chromatic number and achieved optimal
coloring in 128 instances.

*Bastian Jäckl,Vojtěch Kloda,Daniel A. Keim,Jakub Lokoč*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Adding location-based prompts to vague text queries improves retrieval performance in homogeneous domains like underwater scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains with homogeneous entities make text-based querying challenging due to vague descriptions from non-expert users.

Method: Collected 741 human annotations with text descriptions and bounding boxes, evaluated CLIP on static sub-regions vs. full images.

Result: Simple partitioning (3x3 or 5-grid overlap) significantly enhances retrieval effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Location-based prompts complement vague text queries, improving performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

performance characteristics. We examine the RV32I base instruction set with
extensions for multiplication (M) and atomic operations (A). Through
cycle-accurate simulation of a pipelined implementation, we evaluate
performance metrics including CPI (cycles per instruction) and power
efficiency. Our results demonstrate RISC-V's advantages in embedded systems and
its scalability for custom accelerators. Comparative analysis shows a 17%

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of LLMs for generating synthesizable and functionally correct SystemVerilog code for standard communication protocols, introducing a benchmark suite for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The applicability of LLMs for hardware description languages (HDLs) like SystemVerilog, which require strict timing and synthesizability constraints, is underexplored.

Method: The study introduces a benchmark suite for four protocols (SPI, I2C, UART, AXI) and evaluates LLM-generated SystemVerilog code for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity using simulation and test benches.

Result: The paper assesses the capabilities of LLMs in generating HDL code, focusing on practical design tasks like testbench development and verification.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential and challenges of using LLMs for HDL code generation, providing a foundation for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA deployment for RL is resource-intensive, especially with high-quality images, prompting the need for efficient solutions.

Method: QForce-RL leverages E2HRL to reduce RL actions and QuaRL for quantization-based SIMD hardware acceleration, optimizing model size and compute ops.

Result: The architecture achieves up to 2.3x performance improvement and 2.6x better FPS compared to existing works.

Conclusion: QForce-RL offers scalable, efficient deployment for resource-constrained devices, balancing latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MAGNet is a hybrid deep learning model combining improved U-Net and GNN for DRC violation prediction, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve DRC violation prediction in IC designs for cost reduction and efficiency.

Method: Hybrid model with enhanced U-Net (DAM, MSCM) and GNN for spatial and topological feature extraction, plus label amplification.

Result: MAGNet achieves higher accuracy, lower false positives, and better hotspot detection than ibUnet, RouteNet, and J-Net.

Conclusion: MAGNet effectively integrates spatial, semantic, and structural information, advancing DRC prediction in CAD.

Abstract: Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and
design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs.
Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided
design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model
that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation
prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module
(DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability
in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we
construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply
a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During
graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features
with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted
during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation
patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and
structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced
false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through
incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for
hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet,
and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial
improvements in overall performance.

TL;DR: VeriLoC predicts chip design quality from Verilog code at line- and module-level using LLM embeddings, achieving high accuracy and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage prediction of design-quality metrics like timing and congestion from Verilog code is crucial but complex, especially for line-level issues.

Method: VeriLoC uses Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract embeddings and trains classifiers/regressors on these for line- and module-level predictions.

Result: Achieves F1-scores of 0.86-0.95 for line-level prediction and reduces error from 14-18% to 4%.

Conclusion: VeriLoC's embeddings and insights can benefit other hardware design tasks, offering high accuracy and practical value.

Abstract: Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage
prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion
directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware
design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of
code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works
have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph
representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict
module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We
propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from
Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages
recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and
module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on
concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of
0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean
average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We
believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of
value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design.

*Emet Behrendt,Shing Wai Pun,Prashant J. Nair*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bullseye predictor to improve branch prediction in out-of-order processors by targeting hard-to-predict branches, reducing mispredictions and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over half of the remaining mispredictions in TAGE-SC-L stem from hard-to-predict branches, which cause thrashing and eviction before counters mature. Enlarging tables offers minimal improvement.

Method: The Bullseye predictor augments TAGE-SC-L with a 28 KB subsystem. It identifies problematic branches using an H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to branch-specific perceptrons. A trial phase ensures perceptron residency based on accuracy and output magnitude.

Result: The Bullseye predictor achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI of 145.09, improving fidelity on hard-to-predict branches.

Conclusion: The Bullseye predictor effectively targets hard-to-predict branches, reducing mispredictions and pollution while operating in parallel with TAGE-SC-L.

Abstract: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While
the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical
corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem
from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under
diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction
before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging
the tables offers only marginal improvement.
  We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem
called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a
set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two
branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other
by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in
an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's
sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which
TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache,
and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher
fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI
of 145.09.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ASPO enhances Bayesian Optimization (BO) for processor design by handling categorical parameters and reducing optimization time, achieving significant performance and design-time improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard BO struggles with categorical parameters and scalability in FPGA-based soft-processor designs, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: ASPO customizes BO with a novel covariance kernel for categorical parameters, penalizes the acquisition function for evaluation time, and reuses FPGA synthesis checkpoints.

Result: ASPO reduces execution time by up to 35% for the 'multiply' benchmark and design time by up to 74% compared to Boomerang.

Conclusion: ASPO effectively addresses BO limitations in processor design, offering scalable and efficient optimization for FPGA-based systems.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design
parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving
categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division
circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity,
which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft
processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive
form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters.
Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO
method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to
address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO
supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel.
It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO
acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA
synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets
three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is
evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce
execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to
35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time
for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art
hardware-oriented BO approach.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a novel method using smaller LMs for query expansion, addressing cost and accessibility issues of large LLMs. It filters hallucinations and combines documents, outperforming other methods with smaller LMs and competing with large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs for query expansion are costly and inaccessible. Smaller LMs are a viable alternative but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistencies.

Method: GOLFer uses a hallucination filter to remove non-factual content and a combiner to integrate filtered documents with queries.

Result: GOLFer outperforms smaller LM methods and competes with large LLMs on web search and low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: GOLFer effectively leverages smaller LMs for query expansion, offering a cost-efficient and competitive alternative to large LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Huiyao Chen,Yi Yang,Yinghui Li,Meishan Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DISRetrieval is a hierarchical retrieval framework for long document understanding that leverages discourse structure, outperforming existing methods in retrieval and QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long document understanding fail to capture inherent discourse structure, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DISRetrieval uses RST for hierarchical document organization, LLM-enhanced node representation, and hierarchical evidence retrieval to maintain discourse coherence.

Result: DISRetrieval shows substantial improvements in retrieval metrics and QA tasks on QASPER and QuALITY datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating discourse structure enhances retrieval effectiveness, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document representation.

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing A/B testing for personalized marketing to maximize user response drives the need for an automated, dynamic solution.

Method: The framework uses a pre-trained LLM to generate content variants, dynamically fuses user and context data, and selects versions via policy optimization with real-time feedback.

Result: Numerical results show RL-LLM-ABTest outperforms classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and benchmark RL methods.

Conclusion: The RL-LLM-ABTest framework effectively addresses personalized marketing challenges by leveraging reinforcement learning and LLMs for dynamic A/B testing.

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm
the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this
paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using
reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and
personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained
instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate
content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically
embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with
the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state.
The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy
optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is
estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and
conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded
into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to
generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B
testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and
benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

*Xuan Xu,Fufang Wen,Beilin Chu,Zhibing Fu,Qinhong Lin,Jiaqi Liu,Binjie Fei,Zhongliang Yang,Linna Zhou,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a large Chinese financial corpus, outperforms LLMs and other BERT variants in financial tasks like classification, retrieval, and topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of LLMs in financial NLP tasks, such as poor performance on discriminative tasks, reliance on RAG for generative tasks, and inadequacies in feature-based scenarios.

Method: Develop FinBERT2, a financial-specific bidirectional encoder pretrained on a 32b-token corpus, and fine-tune it for discriminative (Fin-Labelers), retrieval (Fin-Retrievers), and topic modeling (Fin-TopicModel) tasks.

Result: FinBERT2 variants outperform other models: Fin-Labelers by 0.4%-12.3%, Fin-Retrievers by 4.2%-6.8%, and Fin-TopicModel provides superior clustering.

Conclusion: FinBERT2 bridges the gap in financial NLP, offering practical improvements over LLMs and other BERT variants, and provides insights for deploying BERT models in the LLM era.

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates RAG components for Arabic, identifying optimal chunking, embedding models, rerankers, and language models using the RAGAS framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing RAG pipelines for Arabic, which is underexplored compared to high-resource languages.

Method: Empirical evaluation of RAG components (chunking, embeddings, rerankers, language models) across diverse Arabic datasets using RAGAS metrics.

Result: Sentence-aware chunking, BGE-M3/Multilingual-E5-large embeddings, bge-reranker-v2-m3, and Aya-8B outperformed alternatives.

Conclusion: Provides insights and guidelines for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NR4DER improves MOOC exercise recommendations by enhancing filtering, inactive student representation, and diversity via neural re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high dropout rates and lack of adaptability to diverse learning paces in existing MOOC exercise recommendation systems.

Method: Uses mLSTM for filtering, sequence enhancement for inactive students, and neural re-ranking for diverse recommendations.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and diversity across real-world datasets.

Conclusion: NR4DER effectively adapts to varied learning paces and improves recommendation quality.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing
number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving
student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with
high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of
students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students'
learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting
in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise
Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to
improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a
sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students,
accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally,
it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on
individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results
indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple
real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of
students.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches like BERTopic are superior for aviation data analysis, with future work exploring hybrid models and multilingual datasets.

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based
embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of
0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability
as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG improves LLM-based recommendations by integrating personalized knowledge graphs, outperforming flat retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods lack relational structure from user-item interactions, limiting recommendation quality.

Method: Extends LlamaRec with a lightweight user preference module to dynamically identify relation paths in a knowledge graph, integrated into LLM prompts.

Result: Shows significant improvements in ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall) on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations, enabling scalable, knowledge-aware personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

Conclusion: Simpler recommendation strategies can be effective, especially in noisy environments, reducing the need for complex exploration methods.

Abstract: This study explores strategies for optimizing news headline recommendations

*Arian Askari,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Ilya Gusev,Moran Beladev*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HotelMatch-LLM is a multimodal dense retrieval model for travel, improving natural language property search over traditional engines. It introduces domain-specific multi-task optimization, asymmetrical dense retrieval, and advanced image processing, outperforming state-of-the-art models like MARVEL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel search engines require users to start with a destination and edit parameters, limiting flexibility. HotelMatch-LLM aims to enable more intuitive natural language property search.

Method: The model combines multi-task optimization (retrieval, visual, and language objectives), asymmetrical dense retrieval (SLM for queries, LLM for hotel embeddings), and extensive image processing.

Result: HotelMatch-LLM achieves 0.681 on the main query type test set, surpassing MARVEL's 0.603. It shows strong generalizability and scalability.

Conclusion: HotelMatch-LLM effectively addresses limitations of traditional travel search, demonstrating superior performance and scalability in multimodal retrieval.

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel
data; and (3) Extensive image processing to handle all property image
galleries. Experiments on four diverse test sets show HotelMatch-LLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including VISTA and MARVEL.
Specifically, on the test set -- main query type -- we achieve 0.681 for
HotelMatch-LLM compared to 0.603 for the most effective baseline, MARVEL. Our
analysis highlights the impact of our multi-task optimization, the
generalizability of HotelMatch-LLM across LLM architectures, and its

*Antonio Pariente,Ignacio Hounie,Santiago Segarra,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve vector search by leveraging metric tree properties in $q$-metric spaces, reducing comparisons and achieving logarithmic complexity as $q$ approaches infinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vector search algorithms ignore the metric structure of embeddings, treating it as a constraint rather than exploiting its properties.

Method: A novel projection method embeds vector datasets into $q$-metric spaces, preserving nearest neighbors. An approximation of this projection is learned to transform queries efficiently.

Result: Experiments with text and image embeddings show metric tree algorithms, typically weak in high dimensions, become competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Exploiting $q$-metric spaces and learning projections can enhance the performance of classic metric tree algorithms for vector search.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search
algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a
constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger
version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search.
Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic.
Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets
with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving
the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection
to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances
satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image
vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic
metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional
data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search
methods.

*Md Aminul Islam,Kathryn Vasilaky,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel control function-based method is proposed to correct position bias in implicit feedback data for learning-to-rank systems, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit feedback data like clicks is biased, especially by position bias, leading to suboptimal ranking performance if not corrected.

Method: A two-stage process uses exogenous variation from ranking residuals to correct position bias without needing click or propensity models, accommodating nonlinearity.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting position bias and includes a technique for debiasing validation clicks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively corrects position bias, is generalizable, and enhances ranking performance without requiring unbiased validation data.

Abstract: Implicit feedback data, such as user clicks, is commonly used in
learning-to-rank (LTR) systems because it is easy to collect and it often
reflects user preferences. However, this data is prone to various biases, and
training an LTR system directly on biased data can result in suboptimal ranking
performance. One of the most prominent and well-studied biases in implicit
feedback data is position bias, which occurs because users are more likely to
interact with higher-ranked documents regardless of their true relevance. In
this paper, we propose a novel control function-based method that accounts for
position bias in a two-stage process. The first stage uses exogenous variation
from the residuals of the ranking process to correct for position bias in the
second stage click equation. Unlike previous position bias correction methods,
our method does not require knowledge of the click or propensity model and
allows for nonlinearity in the underlying ranking model. Moreover, our method
is general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by
plugging it into the second stage. We also introduce a technique to debias
validation clicks for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal model in the
absence of unbiased validation data. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in correcting for position bias.

*Amit Jaspal,Qian Dang,Ajantha Ramineni*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RADAR improves recall in recommender systems by using offline pre-ranking to enhance retrieval quality, boosting engagement metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The retrieval stage in multi-stage ranking systems struggles to surface highly engaging items efficiently from large catalogs.

Method: RADAR leverages asynchronous offline computation to pre-rank a larger candidate set using a full-complexity ranking model, stored for online use.

Result: Offline experiments show 2X Recall@200 improvement; online A/B tests confirm a +0.8% engagement lift.

Conclusion: RADAR effectively improves recommendation quality under strict online constraints.

Abstract: Modern large-scale recommender systems employ multi-stage ranking funnel
(Retrieval, Pre-ranking, Ranking) to balance engagement and computational
constraints (latency, CPU). However, the initial retrieval stage, often relying
on efficient but less precise methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), struggles
to effectively surface the most engaging items from billion-scale catalogs,
particularly distinguishing highly relevant and engaging candidates from merely
relevant ones. We introduce Recall Augmentation through Deferred Asynchronous
Retrieval (RADAR), a novel framework that leverages asynchronous, offline
computation to pre-rank a significantly larger candidate set for users using
the full complexity ranking model. These top-ranked items are stored and
utilized as a high-quality retrieval source during online inference, bypassing
online retrieval and pre-ranking stages for these candidates. We demonstrate
through offline experiments that RADAR significantly boosts recall (2X
Recall@200 vs DNN retrieval baseline) by effectively combining a larger
retrieved candidate set with a more powerful ranking model. Online A/B tests
confirm a +0.8% lift in topline engagement metrics, validating RADAR as a
practical and effective method to improve recommendation quality under strict
online serving constraints.

*Ken Yagel,Eyal German,Aviel Ben Siman Tov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MoE-MLoRA improves multi-domain recommendation by dynamically weighting domain-specific experts, showing gains in dynamic datasets but limited benefits in structured ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like MLoRA lack flexibility for diverse user behaviors across domains, prompting the need for a more adaptive approach.

Method: MoE-MLoRA trains domain-specific experts independently, then uses a gating network to dynamically weight their contributions.

Result: Improves performance in dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20) but has limited gains in structured, low-diversity datasets. Larger expert ensembles don't always help.

Conclusion: Expert-based architectures with task-aware specialization and adaptive gating enhance accuracy in complex multi-domain recommendation systems.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems must adapt to user interactions across
different domains. Traditional approaches like MLoRA apply a single adaptation
per domain but lack flexibility in handling diverse user behaviors. To address
this, we propose MoE-MLoRA, a mixture-of-experts framework where each expert is
first trained independently to specialize in its domain before a gating network
is trained to weight their contributions dynamically. We evaluate MoE-MLoRA
across eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves
performance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)
but offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity
and sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that
larger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for
model-aware tuning. Our findings highlight the potential of expert-based
architectures for multi-domain recommendation systems, demonstrating that
task-aware specialization and adaptive gating can enhance predictive accuracy
in complex environments. The implementation and code are available in our
GitHub repository.

*Tzu-wen Hsu,Ke-Han Lu,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD) reduces hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) by using contrastive decoding to prioritize tokens influenced by audio context, improving performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior LALMs exhibit hallucination issues, prompting the need for a lightweight, inference-time solution to enhance accuracy.

Method: AAD employs contrastive decoding to compare token predictions with and without audio, favoring tokens boosted by audio context.

Result: AAD improves F1 scores by 0.046 to 0.428 on hallucination datasets and accuracy by 5.4% to 10.3% on general audio QA datasets.

Conclusion: AAD effectively mitigates LALM hallucination and enhances performance, validated by thorough ablation studies.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each

*Asahi Sakuma,Hiroaki Sato,Ryuga Sugano,Tadashi Kumano,Yoshihiko Kawai,Tetsuji Ogawa*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel framework, Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), is proposed to improve multi-talker speech recognition without auxiliary data, reducing errors by 26%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like Serialized Output Training (SOT) fail in speaker assignment, and auxiliary data (e.g., timestamps) is hard to extract.

Method: SD-CTC extends CTC to assign tokens and speaker labels per frame, integrated into SOT for speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and transcriptions.

Result: SD-CTC with SOT reduces SOT's error rate by 26%, matching state-of-the-art methods using auxiliary data.

Conclusion: SD-CTC effectively improves multi-talker recognition without auxiliary information, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

*Woongjib Choi,Byeong Hyeon Kim,Hyungseob Lim,Inseon Jang,Hong-Goo Kang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new parametric non-blind bandwidth extension method using DNNs to improve audio signal reconstruction by addressing limitations of conventional SBR and blind DNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth limitation in audio signals due to channel capacity and data constraints necessitates better reconstruction methods beyond conventional SBR and blind DNN approaches.

Method: The proposed method integrates DNN-based side information extraction and bandwidth extension at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline, avoiding the blindness of existing DNN methods.

Result: The approach aims to outperform conventional SBR and blind DNN methods by leveraging parametric non-blind techniques.

Conclusion: The new method offers a promising solution for high-quality audio bandwidth extension by combining the strengths of DNNs and parametric approaches.

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high
frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth
limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons,
including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral
band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth
extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction
techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio
signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth
extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually
referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information
extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band
signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace
conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies
results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My
proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth
extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth
extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

### [644] [Less is More: some Computational Principles based on Parcimony, and Limitations of Natural Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07060)
*Laura Cohen,Xavier Hinaut,Lilyana Petrova,Alexandre Pitti,Syd Reynal,Ichiro Tsuda*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how constraints in natural intelligence (NI) enhance efficiency, adaptability, and creativity, contrasting with AI's reliance on vast resources. It proposes adopting NI principles for better AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why NI achieves more with less (e.g., infants learning from sparse data) and how these principles can improve AI.

Method: Analyzes NI mechanisms like neural bandwidth limits, chaotic itinerancy, reservoir computing, and developmental processes.

Result: Constraints in NI lead to concise coding, robust generalization, and flexibility, which AI lacks.

Conclusion: Adopting NI's 'less is more' principles (energy limits, parsimonious architectures, real-world interaction) can make AI more efficient and interpretable.

Abstract: Natural intelligence (NI) consistently achieves more with less. Infants learn
language, develop abstract concepts, and acquire sensorimotor skills from
sparse data, all within tight neural and energy limits. In contrast, today's AI
relies on virtually unlimited computational power, energy, and data to reach
high performance. This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically
catalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how
limited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex
patterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like
representations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust
generalization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain
transits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage
uncertainty. We then highlight reservoir computing, where random projections
facilitate rapid generalization from small datasets. Drawing on developmental
perspectives, we emphasize how intrinsic motivation, along with responsive
social environments, drives infant language learning and discovery of meaning.
Such active, embodied processes are largely absent in current AI. Finally, we
suggest that adopting 'less is more' principles -- energy constraints,
parsimonious architectures, and real-world interaction -- can foster the
emergence of more efficient, interpretable, and biologically grounded
artificial systems.

*Michał P. Karpowicz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Large language models cannot avoid hallucination due to an impossibility theorem showing no inference mechanism can satisfy four key properties simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs hallucinate and identify trade-offs in their design.

Method: Formal impossibility theorem using the Green-Laffont framework, modeling LLM inference as an 'auction of ideas.'

Result: Proves no mechanism can simultaneously ensure truthful generation, semantic conservation, relevant knowledge, and optimality.

Conclusion: Highlights inherent trade-offs in LLM design, guiding future architecture and evaluation.

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.

*Fahad Mostafa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A unified statistical framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks, extending classical methods to sequential neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the heuristic and computationally expensive problem of model selection in LSTM networks.

Method: Proposes penalized likelihoods for temporal structures, a generalized threshold approach for hidden state dynamics, and efficient estimation using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood.

Result: Demonstrates flexibility and improved performance in biomedical data examples.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic and efficient approach to LSTM model selection, enhancing performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models have become the
cornerstone for sequential data modeling in numerous applications, ranging from
natural language processing to time series forecasting. Despite their success,
the problem of model selection, including hyperparameter tuning, architecture
specification, and regularization choice remains largely heuristic and
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a unified statistical
framework for systematic model selection in LSTM networks. Our framework
extends classical model selection ideas, such as information criteria and
shrinkage estimation, to sequential neural networks. We define penalized
likelihoods adapted to temporal structures, propose a generalized threshold
approach for hidden state dynamics, and provide efficient estimation strategies
using variational Bayes and approximate marginal likelihood methods. Several
biomedical data centric examples demonstrate the flexibility and improved
performance of the proposed framework.

*Sherman Khoo,Yakun Wang,Song Liu,Mark Beaumont*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A gradient-based method for likelihood maximization using simulations, with a closed-form solution for Fisher score approximation, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of maximizing intractable likelihoods when simulations are available, aiming to simplify complex likelihood landscapes.

Method: Proposes a sequential, gradient-based optimization with local score matching and linear parameterization for closed-form Fisher score approximation.

Result: Theoretical guarantees on bias and superior empirical performance on synthetic and real-world problems.

Conclusion: The method is fast, flexible, and efficient, offering a practical solution for complex likelihood maximization.

Abstract: We study the problem of likelihood maximization when the likelihood function
is intractable but model simulations are readily available. We propose a
sequential, gradient-based optimization method that directly models the Fisher
score based on a local score matching technique which uses simulations from a
localized region around each parameter iterate. By employing a linear
parameterization to the surrogate score model, our technique admits a
closed-form, least-squares solution. This approach yields a fast, flexible, and
efficient approximation to the Fisher score, effectively smoothing the
likelihood objective and mitigating the challenges posed by complex likelihood
landscapes. We provide theoretical guarantees for our score estimator,
including bounds on the bias introduced by the smoothing. Empirical results on
a range of synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the superior
performance of our method compared to existing benchmarks.

### [648] [Robust Learnability of Sample-Compressible Distributions under Noisy or Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06613)
*Arefe Boushehrian,Amir Najafi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the learnability of sample compressible distribution families under data perturbations, providing conditions for PAC-learnability in additive noise and adversarial corruption models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of learnable distribution classes by analyzing their robustness to data perturbations, addressing open problems in high-dimensional learning.

Method: Develops a perturbation-quantization framework to interface with compression schemes, analyzing additive noise and adversarial corruption models.

Result: Establishes sample complexity bounds for learning mixtures of uniform distributions and Gaussian mixtures under perturbations, resolving open problems.

Conclusion: Sample compressible families remain learnable under perturbations, with generalizable results and minimal assumptions.

Abstract: Learning distribution families over $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fundamental problem
in unsupervised learning and statistics. A central question in this setting is
whether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be
(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its
sample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \emph{sample
compressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a
structural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees
PAC-learnability. This discovery subsequently enabled a series of recent
advancements in deriving nearly tight sample complexity bounds for various
high-dimensional open problems. It has been further conjectured that the
converse also holds: every learnable class admits a tight sample compression
scheme.
  In this work, we establish that sample compressible families remain learnable
even from perturbed samples, subject to a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions. We analyze two models of data perturbation: (i) an additive
independent noise model, and (ii) an adversarial corruption model, where an
adversary manipulates a limited subset of the samples unknown to the learner.
Our results are general and rely on as minimal assumptions as possible. We
develop a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with
the compression scheme and leads to sample complexity bounds that scale
gracefully with the noise level and corruption budget. As concrete
applications, we establish new sample complexity bounds for learning finite
mixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and
adversarial perturbations, as well as for learning Gaussian mixture models from
adversarially corrupted samples, resolving two open problems in the literature.

*Longlin Yu,Jiajun Zha,Tong Yang,Tianyu Xie,Xiangyu Zhang,S. -H. Gary Chan,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CoSIM introduces a continuous semi-implicit model for efficient, simulation-free training, outperforming existing diffusion model acceleration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical semi-implicit models face slow convergence in sequential training; CoSIM addresses this by enabling continuous, efficient training.

Method: CoSIM extends hierarchical semi-implicit models with a continuous transition kernel for simulation-free training and multistep distillation.

Result: CoSIM matches or surpasses existing diffusion model acceleration methods, excelling in image generation tasks like FD-DINOv2.

Conclusion: CoSIM offers a novel, efficient approach for generative model acceleration, demonstrating superior performance and consistency.

Abstract: Semi-implicit distributions have shown great promise in variational inference
and generative modeling. Hierarchical semi-implicit models, which stack
multiple semi-implicit layers, enhance the expressiveness of semi-implicit
distributions and can be used to accelerate diffusion models given pretrained
score networks. However, their sequential training often suffers from slow
convergence. In this paper, we introduce CoSIM, a continuous semi-implicit
model that extends hierarchical semi-implicit models into a continuous
framework. By incorporating a continuous transition kernel, CoSIM enables
efficient, simulation-free training. Furthermore, we show that CoSIM achieves
consistency with a carefully designed transition kernel, offering a novel
approach for multistep distillation of generative models at the distributional
level. Extensive experiments on image generation demonstrate that CoSIM
performs on par or better than existing diffusion model acceleration methods,
achieving superior performance on FD-DINOv2.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel method uses Gaussian processes with disaggregated conflict data to estimate and forecast spatiotemporal conflict trends, offering insights into conflict dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict violent conflict patterns by leveraging detailed data and Gaussian processes for better analysis and forecasting.

Method: Utilizes highly disaggregated conflict data and Gaussian processes to model spatiotemporal trends.

Result: Enables estimation of conflict trends, insights into conflict traps and diffusion, and future conflict forecasting.

Conclusion: The approach provides a parsimonious yet powerful framework for conflict analysis and prediction using historical data.

Abstract: I present a novel approach to estimating the temporal and spatial patterns of
violent conflict. I show how we can use highly temporally and spatially
disaggregated data on conflict events in tandem with Gaussian processes to
estimate temporospatial conflict trends. These trends can be studied to gain
insight into conflict traps, diffusion and tempo-spatial conflict exposure in
general; they can also be used to control for such phenomenons given other
estimation tasks; lastly, the approach allow us to extrapolate the estimated
tempo-spatial conflict patterns into future temporal units, thus facilitating
powerful, stat-of-the-art, conflict forecasts. Importantly, these results are
achieved via a relatively parsimonious framework using only one data source:
past conflict patterns.

*Yuan-Hao Wei,Yan-Jie Sun*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Half-AVAE, an improved VAE framework for ICA, addressing underdetermined conditions by eliminating the encoder and using adversarial networks for better latent variable independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAEs struggle with underdetermined ICA, where latent variables exceed observed signals. The study aims to enhance independence and interpretability of latent variables.

Method: Proposes Half-AVAE, building on Half-VAE by removing the encoder and integrating adversarial networks and External Enhancement terms.

Result: Half-AVAE outperforms baselines (GP-AVAE, Half-VAE) in recovering independent components under underdetermined conditions, with lower root mean square errors.

Conclusion: Half-AVAE demonstrates the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, enabling effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, with applications in disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.

Abstract: This study advances the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework by addressing
challenges in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) under both determined and
underdetermined conditions, focusing on enhancing the independence and
interpretability of latent variables. Traditional VAEs map observed data to
latent variables and back via an encoder-decoder architecture, but struggle
with underdetermined ICA where the number of latent variables exceeds observed
signals. The proposed Half Adversarial VAE (Half-AVAE) builds on the
encoder-free Half-VAE framework, eliminating explicit inverse mapping to tackle
underdetermined scenarios. By integrating adversarial networks and External
Enhancement (EE) terms, Half-AVAE promotes mutual independence among latent
dimensions, achieving factorized and interpretable representations. Experiments
with synthetic signals demonstrate that Half-AVAE outperforms baseline models,
including GP-AVAE and Half-VAE, in recovering independent components under
underdetermined conditions, as evidenced by lower root mean square errors. The
study highlights the flexibility of VAEs in variational inference, showing that
encoder omission, combined with adversarial training and structured priors,
enables effective solutions for complex ICA tasks, advancing applications in
disentanglement, causal inference, and generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study quantile-optimal policy learning where the goal is to find a policy
whose reward distribution has the largest $\alpha$-quantile for some $\alpha
\in (0, 1)$. We focus on the offline setting whose generating process involves
unobserved confounders. Such a problem suffers from three main challenges: (i)
nonlinearity of the quantile objective as a functional of the reward
distribution, (ii) unobserved confounding issue, and (iii) insufficient
coverage of the offline dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a
suite of causal-assisted policy learning methods that provably enjoy strong
theoretical guarantees under mild conditions. In particular, to address (i) and
(ii), using causal inference tools such as instrumental variables and negative
controls, we propose to estimate the quantile objectives by solving nonlinear
functional integral equations. Then we adopt a minimax estimation approach with
nonparametric models to solve these integral equations, and propose to
construct conservative policy estimates that address (iii). The final policy is
the one that maximizes these pessimistic estimates. In addition, we propose a
novel regularized policy learning method that is more amenable to computation.
Finally, we prove that the policies learned by these methods are
$\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ quantile-optimal under a mild coverage
assumption on the offline dataset. Here, $\tilde{\mathscr{O}}(\cdot)$ omits
poly-logarithmic factors. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
sample-efficient policy learning algorithms for estimating the quantile-optimal
policy when there exist unmeasured confounding.

*Daolang Huang,Xinyi Wen,Ayush Bharti,Samuel Kaski,Luigi Acerbi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ALINE is a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active data acquisition, using a transformer trained via reinforcement learning to strategically query data and refine predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of systems needing to acquire informative data and perform instant inference, where existing amortized methods fall short.

Method: ALINE employs a transformer architecture trained with reinforcement learning, focusing on self-estimated information gain for data querying and inference.

Result: ALINE achieves instant, accurate inference and efficient data selection in tasks like regression-based active learning and Bayesian experimental design.

Conclusion: ALINE effectively unifies active learning and Bayesian inference, optimizing for posterior estimation and predictive tasks.

Abstract: Many critical applications, from autonomous scientific discovery to
personalized medicine, demand systems that can both strategically acquire the
most informative data and instantaneously perform inference based upon it.
While amortized methods for Bayesian inference and experimental design offer
part of the solution, neither approach is optimal in the most general and
challenging task, where new data needs to be collected for instant inference.
To tackle this issue, we introduce the Amortized Active Learning and Inference
Engine (ALINE), a unified framework for amortized Bayesian inference and active
data acquisition. ALINE leverages a transformer architecture trained via
reinforcement learning with a reward based on self-estimated information gain
provided by its own integrated inference component. This allows it to
strategically query informative data points while simultaneously refining its
predictions. Moreover, ALINE can selectively direct its querying strategy
towards specific subsets of model parameters or designated predictive tasks,
optimizing for posterior estimation, data prediction, or a mixture thereof.
Empirical results on regression-based active learning, classical Bayesian
experimental design benchmarks, and a psychometric model with selectively
targeted parameters demonstrate that ALINE delivers both instant and accurate
inference along with efficient selection of informative points.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the R2-G2 estimator, a Rao-Blackwellised version of the reparameterisation gradient estimator, showing its benefits for models with latent Gaussian variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve gradient-based optimization for models with latent Gaussian variables by reducing variance in gradient estimators.

Method: Proposes the R2-G2 estimator, a Rao-Blackwellised version of the reparameterisation gradient estimator, and demonstrates its application, including in Bayesian MLPs.

Result: R2-G2 consistently improves initial training performance in models using multiple reparameterisation tricks.

Conclusion: The R2-G2 estimator extends the benefits of Rao-Blackwellised gradients to a broader range of probabilistic models, enhancing training efficiency.

Abstract: Latent Gaussian variables have been popularised in probabilistic machine
learning. In turn, gradient estimators are the machinery that facilitates
gradient-based optimisation for models with latent Gaussian variables. The
reparameterisation trick is often used as the default estimator as it is simple
to implement and yields low-variance gradients for variational inference. In
this work, we propose the R2-G2 estimator as the Rao-Blackwellisation of the
reparameterisation gradient estimator. Interestingly, we show that the local
reparameterisation gradient estimator for Bayesian MLPs is an instance of the
R2-G2 estimator and Rao-Blackwellisation. This lets us extend benefits of
Rao-Blackwellised gradients to a suite of probabilistic models. We show that
initial training with R2-G2 consistently yields better performance in models
with multiple applications of the reparameterisation trick.

TL;DR: Proposes an algorithm for change point monitoring in linear causal models with interventions, using centralization and KL divergence to amplify changes. Includes adaptive intervention policies and theoretical optimality proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve change point detection in causal models by accounting for interventions and optimizing intervention node selection.

Method: Uses centralization to focus changes into one dimension, selects intervention nodes via KL divergence, and proposes adaptive monitoring methods.

Result: Theoretical first-order optimality proven; validated with simulations and real-world case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively monitor change points in causal models with interventions, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: We propose an algorithm for change point monitoring in linear causal models
that accounts for interventions. Through a special centralization technique, we
can concentrate the changes arising from causal propagation across nodes into a
single dimension. Additionally, by selecting appropriate intervention nodes
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can amplify the change magnitude. We
also present an algorithm for selecting the intervention values, which aids in
the identification of the most effective intervention nodes. Two monitoring
methods are proposed, each with an adaptive intervention policy to make a
balance between exploration and exploitation. We theoretically demonstrate the
first-order optimality of the proposed methods and validate their properties
using simulation datasets and two real-world case studies.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the long-time behavior of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics (SRNLD) and proposes a design for the skew-symmetric matrix to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unclear design of the skew-symmetric matrix in SRNLD for practical performance improvement in constrained sampling problems.

Method: The authors establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD under specific conditions for the skew-symmetric matrix.

Result: Theoretical and numerical results show that SRNLD accelerates convergence to the target distribution compared to reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD).

Conclusion: The proposed skew-symmetric matrix design enhances the performance of SRNLD, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: The problem of sampling a target probability distribution on a constrained
domain arises in many applications including machine learning. For constrained
sampling, various Langevin algorithms such as projected Langevin Monte Carlo
(PLMC) based on the discretization of reflected Langevin dynamics (RLD) and
more generally skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin Monte Carlo (SRNLMC)
based on the discretization of skew-reflected non-reversible Langevin dynamics
(SRNLD) have been proposed and studied in the literature. This work focuses on
the long-time behavior of SRNLD, where a skew-symmetric matrix is added to RLD.
Although the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SRNLD (and SRNLMC) and the
acceleration compared to RLD (and PMLC) have been studied in the literature, it
is not clear how one should design the skew-symmetric matrix in the dynamics to
achieve good performance in practice. We establish a large deviation principle
(LDP) for the empirical measure of SRNLD when the skew-symmetric matrix is
chosen such that its product with the inward unit normal vector field on the
boundary is zero. By explicitly characterizing the rate functions, we show that
SRNLD can accelerate the convergence to the target distribution compared to RLD
with this choice of the skew-symmetric matrix. Numerical experiments for SRNLMC
based on the proposed skew-symmetric matrix show superior performance which
validate the theoretical findings from the large deviations theory.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing
privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key
criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to
verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent
spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space,
making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of
watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and
temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for
multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and
spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark
directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is
the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction
error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to
detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time
series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively
evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark
detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5
datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that
TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in
correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining
consistently detectable.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework for designing LLM watermarks, proposing two new methods (HeavyWater and SimplexWater) that balance detection accuracy and text quality, especially in low-entropy tasks like coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in LLM watermarking, particularly in low-entropy tasks, by optimizing the use of random side information for better detection and minimal text distortion.

Method: Proposes an optimization framework for watermark design, resulting in two tunable watermarks (HeavyWater and SimplexWater) applicable to any LLM.

Result: Demonstrates high detection accuracy with minimal text quality compromise, especially in low-entropy scenarios, and reveals connections to coding theory.

Conclusion: HeavyWater and SimplexWater offer effective, tunable solutions for LLM watermarking, balancing detection and quality, with broader implications for coding theory.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD) to evaluate covert attacks on language models, where attackers use benign-seeming queries to bypass safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook covert attacks that exploit fragmented, harmless queries to enable misuse, necessitating better defenses.

Method: Developed BSD, a data generation pipeline for evaluating covert attacks and defenses, and curated two datasets for testing.

Result: Decomposition attacks effectively enable misuse, and stateful defenses are identified as a viable countermeasure.

Conclusion: Stateful defenses are crucial to counter covert attacks, and BSD provides a framework for future evaluations.

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and
low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by
requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries.
Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to
{detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the
attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against
such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data
generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and
corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that
are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker
open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are
effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

*Xiaoyuan Zhu,Yaowen Ye,Tianyi Qiu,Hanlin Zhu,Sijun Tan,Ajraf Mannan,Jonathan Michala,Raluca Ada Popa,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a rank-based uniformity test to detect black-box LLM substitutions, ensuring model authenticity without access to weights or logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API providers may discreetly alter LLMs (e.g., via quantization or fine-tuning), degrading performance and safety, necessitating a detection method.

Method: Uses a rank-based uniformity test to verify behavioral equality between a black-box LLM and an authentic local model, ensuring accuracy and query efficiency.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches in detecting substitutions (e.g., quantization, harmful fine-tuning) under constrained query budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed test is effective, efficient, and robust against adversarial detection, ensuring LLM authenticity.

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

### [661] [HauntAttack: When Attack Follows Reasoning as a Shadow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07031)
*Jingyuan Ma,Rui Li,Zheng Li,Junfeng Liu,Lei Sha,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HauntAttack is a black-box attack framework that embeds harmful instructions into reasoning tasks, revealing safety vulnerabilities in advanced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the safety-reasoning trade-off in LRMs when reasoning is entangled with harmfulness.

Method: Introduces HauntAttack, which replaces original conditions in reasoning questions with harmful instructions to guide models toward unsafe outputs.

Result: Advanced LRMs show significant safety vulnerabilities under HauntAttack.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical security risks in LRMs and provides insights for improving their safety.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

*Yukai Zhou,Sibei Yang,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights the overlooked risk of implicit harm in LLMs, where harmless-looking inputs can lead to dangerous outputs. It introduces JailFlipBench to assess this risk and demonstrates its urgency through evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in LLM safety assessments by focusing on implicit harm, which conventional jailbreak attacks overlook.

Method: Proposes JailFlipBench, a benchmark for implicit harm, and develops JailFlip attack methodologies to evaluate LLMs across diverse scenarios.

Result: Evaluations reveal implicit harm poses immediate real-world risks, urging broader safety measures beyond traditional jailbreak paradigms.

Conclusion: The study calls for expanded LLM safety assessments and alignment to mitigate implicit harm risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

*Rabah Rahal,Abdelaziz Amara Korba,Yacine Ghamri-Doudane*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel intrusion detection framework for EVSE systems uses multimodal data and federated learning to achieve high detection and precision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EVSE systems face cybersecurity challenges like network reconnaissance and DDoS attacks, requiring advanced security beyond traditional IDS.

Method: The framework leverages network traffic and kernel events, using distributed and federated learning for collaborative intelligence and privacy.

Result: The framework achieves a detection rate above 98% and precision exceeding 97% in decentralized environments.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers scalable, privacy-preserving security for EVSE against advanced cyber threats.

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric
vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid
infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and
accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges,
including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the
interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive
security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems
(IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to
detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new
vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion
detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network
traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework
employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence
across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate
exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the
evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving
response to advanced cyber threats

TL;DR: The paper explores AI-driven techniques for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, comparing methods like machine learning and transformer models, and discusses their effectiveness and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contract vulnerabilities cause significant financial losses, and traditional auditing methods lack scalability and adaptability, prompting the need for AI-based solutions.

Method: The study examines AI techniques (machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks, transformers) for vulnerability detection, analyzing code representation and semantic processing.

Result: AI methods show promise in detecting subtle flaws and scaling security assurances, but vary in accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: AI-driven approaches offer potential for smart contract security, but challenges remain in improving accuracy, interpretability, and real-time applicability.

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized
applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their
ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of
platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows,
reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of
millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector.
Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and
formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and
adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions
have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex
patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This
paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart
contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks,
and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents
code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability
classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy,
interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly,
it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this
domain.

*Marco Di Gennaro,Francesco Panebianco,Marco Pianta,Stefano Zanero,Michele Carminati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Amatriciana, a Graph Neural Network-based approach, detects money launderers in transaction graphs using temporal data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with an F1 score of 0.76 and reducing false positives by 55%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Money laundering threatens financial integrity and social security, necessitating automated tools for detection due to increasing transaction volumes.

Method: Amatriciana leverages Graph Neural Networks to analyze entire transaction graphs without time-based splitting, utilizing all relational data.

Result: The model performs well with limited data and excels with more data, achieving an F1 score of 0.76 and reducing false positives by 55%.

Conclusion: Amatriciana is effective for money laundering detection, offering improved accuracy and reduced false positives compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Money laundering is a financial crime that poses a serious threat to
financial integrity and social security. The growing number of transactions
makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies
detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel
approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a
graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the
whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based
subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our
experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited
amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms
other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the
number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary,
Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55%
with respect to other State-of-the-art models.

*Qianshan Wei,Jiaqi Li,Zihan You,Yi Zhan,Kecen Li,Jialin Wu,Xinfeng Li Hengjun Liu,Yi Yu,Bin Cao,Yiwen Xu,Yang Liu,Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Priv Pruning, a framework for applying Differential Privacy (DP) to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with minimal performance degradation and improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP's effectiveness in MLLMs is uncertain due to high computation overhead and model degradation from noise scaling with parameter dimensionality.

Method: Proposes Dual-Priv Pruning: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during DP optimization to mitigate noise impact.

Result: Achieves competitive results with minimal degradation, uses less memory than standard DP-SGD, and shows leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs.

Conclusion: Dual-Priv Pruning is a novel and efficient approach for DP fine-tuning in MLLMs, balancing privacy and utility.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted technique, valued for its
effectiveness in protecting the privacy of task-specific datasets, making it a
critical tool for large language models. However, its effectiveness in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying
Differential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation
overhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive
textual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the
injected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,
leading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and
utility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex
architectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a
framework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning
in MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing
redundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP
optimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter
updates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise
impact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
competitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of
computational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than
standard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order
methods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method
demonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to explore DP fine-tuning in MLLMs. Our code is
coming soon.

*Neil Fendley,Edward W. Staley,Joshua Carney,William Redman,Marie Chau,Nathan Drenkow*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reviews LLM poisoning attacks, proposes a threat model, and categorizes attacks into four dimensions to clarify security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of a unified framework for LLM poisoning attacks due to inconsistencies in terminology and emerging risks.

Method: Systematic review of published LLM poisoning attacks and proposal of a comprehensive threat model with four attack specifications and six metrics.

Result: A framework to categorize LLM poisoning attacks into four dimensions: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and poisons for unique tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model clarifies LLM poisoning risks and provides a structured approach to understanding and mitigating such attacks.

Abstract: With the widespread availability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
and their training datasets, concerns about the security risks associated with
their usage has increased significantly. One of these security risks is the
threat of LLM poisoning attacks where an attacker modifies some part of the LLM
training process to cause the LLM to behave in a malicious way. As an emerging
area of research, the current frameworks and terminology for LLM poisoning
attacks are derived from earlier classification poisoning literature and are
not fully equipped for generative LLM settings. We conduct a systematic review
of published LLM poisoning attacks to clarify the security implications and
address inconsistencies in terminology across the literature. We propose a
comprehensive poisoning threat model applicable to categorize a wide range of
LLM poisoning attacks. The poisoning threat model includes four poisoning
attack specifications that define the logistics and manipulation strategies of
an attack as well as six poisoning metrics used to measure key characteristics
of an attack. Under our proposed framework, we organize our discussion of
published LLM poisoning literature along four critical dimensions of LLM
poisoning attacks: concept poisons, stealthy poisons, persistent poisons, and
poisons for unique tasks, to better understand the current landscape of
security risks.

*Avishag Shapira,Parth Atulbhai Gandhi,Edan Habler,Oleg Brodt,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in web-use agents, showing how attackers can exploit their high-privilege capabilities through malicious web content. It introduces task-aligned injection and demonstrates successful attacks, proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and address the unexplored attack surface created by web-use agents' powerful capabilities, which pose significant security risks.

Method: The study evaluates four popular agents, demonstrating nine payload types that exploit their vulnerabilities, with success rates of 80%-100%. Task-aligned injection is introduced as a novel attack technique.

Result: Attackers can compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability, achieving high success rates across agents, even those with safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: The paper proposes mitigation strategies like oversight mechanisms and task-aware reasoning to secure web-use agents against such exploits.

Abstract: Web-use agents are rapidly being deployed to automate complex web tasks,
operating with extensive browser capabilities including multi-tab navigation,
DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution and authenticated session access.
However, these powerful capabilities create a critical and previously
unexplored attack surface. This paper demonstrates how attackers can exploit
web-use agents' high-privilege capabilities by embedding malicious content in
web pages such as comments, reviews, or advertisements that agents encounter
during legitimate browsing tasks. In addition, we introduce the task-aligned
injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance
rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations
in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent
contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content
contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal. Through
systematic evaluation of four popular agents (OpenAI Operator, Browser Use, Do
Browser, OpenOperator), we demonstrate nine payload types that compromise
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including unauthorized camera
activation, user impersonation, local file exfiltration, password leakage, and
denial of service, with validation across multiple LLMs achieving success rates
of 80%-100%. These payloads succeed across agents with built-in safety
mechanisms, requiring only the ability to post content on public websites,
creating unprecedented risks given the ease of exploitation combined with
agents' high-privilege access. To address this attack, we propose comprehensive
mitigation strategies including oversight mechanisms, execution constraints,
and task-aware reasoning techniques, providing practical directions for secure
development and deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cyber risk quantification method using technology signatures from website crawling, offering a more feasible and accurate alternative to IP-based scanning for SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of IP-based scanning, which lacks data for SMEs and suffers from incomplete mappings, by leveraging readily available technology signatures.

Method: Builds a cyber risk assessment model using public technology signatures obtained from crawling organizational websites.

Result: Demonstrates a strong link between technology signatures and cybersecurity posture, with validated accuracy across cyber incident datasets.

Conclusion: Technology signatures provide a viable and scalable solution for cyber risk assessment, especially for SMEs, and reveal distinct patterns in ransomware attacks versus general cyber incidents.

Abstract: In this paper we present a study on using novel data types to perform cyber
risk quantification by estimating the likelihood of a data breach. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to build a highly accurate cyber risk
assessment model using public and readily available technology signatures
obtained from crawling an organization's website. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous similar approaches that relied on large-scale IP
address based scanning data, which suffers from incomplete/missing IP address
mappings as well as the lack of such data for large numbers of small and
medium-sized organizations (SMEs). In comparison to scan data, technology
digital signature data is more readily available for millions of SMEs. Our
study shows that there is a strong relationship between these technology
signatures and an organization's cybersecurity posture. In cross-validating our
model using different cyber incident datasets, we also highlight the key
differences between ransomware attack victims and the larger population of
cyber incident and data breach victims.

### [670] [From Static to Adaptive Defense: Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Moving Target Defense Against DoS Attacks in UAV Swarm Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07392)
*Yuyang Zhou,Guang Cheng,Kang Du,Zihan Chen,Tian Qin,Yuyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) framework is proposed for proactive DoS mitigation in UAV swarms, outperforming baselines in attack mitigation, recovery time, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarms face severe DoS threats due to their open, dynamic, and resource-constrained nature, requiring adaptive defense mechanisms beyond traditional static or centralized approaches.

Method: The framework uses three coordinated MTD mechanisms (leader switching, route mutation, frequency hopping) and formulates defense as a multi-agent POMDP. UAVs employ FMADRL for distributed policy optimization.

Result: Simulations show a 34.6% improvement in attack mitigation, 94.6% faster recovery, and reductions in energy (29.3%) and cost (98.3%) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The FMADRL-driven MTD framework effectively enhances UAV swarm resilience against DoS attacks while maintaining mission continuity.

Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms has enabled a wide
range of mission-critical applications, but also exposes UAV networks to severe
Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats due to their open wireless environment, dynamic
topology, and resource constraints. Traditional static or centralized defense
mechanisms are often inadequate for such dynamic and distributed scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel federated multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense (MTD) framework
for proactive and adaptive DoS mitigation in UAV swarm networks. Specifically,
we design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader
switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent
flexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network
resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,
resource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV
is equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions
based on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy
gradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense
policies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without
sharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack
mitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and
decreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,
respectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS
attack strategies.

*Marco Di Gennaro,Giovanni De Lucia,Stefano Longari,Stefano Zanero,Michele Carminati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TimberStrike is an optimization-based attack that reconstructs sensitive training data from federated tree-based models, exposing privacy vulnerabilities in current implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored security and privacy risks of tree-based models in Federated Learning, which are often overshadowed by neural networks.

Method: The attack exploits decision trees' discrete nature, using split values and paths to infer data from other clients, tested on frameworks like Flower, NVFlare, and FedTree.

Result: TimberStrike reconstructed 73.05%-95.63% of a stroke prediction dataset, showing current systems' vulnerability. Differential Privacy helps but harms performance.

Conclusion: Tree-based Federated Learning needs tailored privacy mechanisms, as current defenses are insufficient or costly to model utility.

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to
centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without
direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the
security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored.
This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction
attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried
out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using
split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other
clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient
boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare,
and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a
publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently
reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all
implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it
partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model
performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms
specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide
preliminary insights into their design.

*Francesco Marchiori,Denis Donadel,Alessandro Brighente,Mauro Conti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for early-stage EV identification using voltage behavior to improve authentication and prevent energy theft, achieving 0.86 accuracy with lightweight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure EV charging infrastructure is critical due to vulnerabilities in traditional methods, including energy theft and privacy concerns from profiling.

Method: The framework uses early-stage voltage measurements to extract features for EV identification, tested on 7408 charges from 49 EVs.

Result: Achieves up to 0.86 accuracy with 10 key features, demonstrating efficient and reliable identification.

Conclusion: The research introduces a novel authentication method while highlighting privacy risks from charging data misuse.

Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining adoption as a sustainable
alternative to fuel-powered vehicles, making secure charging infrastructure
essential. Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed
that attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One
countermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged
during charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,
allowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected
and repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective
authentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling
raises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns
could enable user tracking.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using
physical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that
voltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to
current behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage
measurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling. Our approach
improves existing methods by enabling faster and more reliable vehicle
identification. We test our solution on a dataset of 7408 usable charges from
49 EVs, achieving up to 0.86 accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows that
near-optimal performance is possible with just 10 key features, improving
efficiency alongside our lightweight models. This research lays the foundation
for a novel authentication factor while exposing potential privacy risks from
unauthorized access to charging data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified taxonomy and formal definitions for data reconstruction attacks in the vision domain, introduces quantitative evaluation metrics, and uses LLMs for visual assessment. It establishes a benchmark for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of formal definitions and universal metrics for data reconstruction attacks hinders progress in the field.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy, formal definitions, and quantitative metrics. Uses LLMs for visual evaluation and benchmarks existing attacks.

Result: Empirical results validate the metrics and provide insights for designing new attacks.

Conclusion: The framework advances the field by standardizing evaluation and enabling systematic comparison of attacks.

Abstract: Data reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover the training dataset of a
target model with limited access, have gained increasing attention in recent
years. However, there is currently no consensus on a formal definition of data
reconstruction attacks or appropriate evaluation metrics for measuring their
quality. This lack of rigorous definitions and universal metrics has hindered
further advancement in this field. In this paper, we address this issue in the
vision domain by proposing a unified attack taxonomy and formal definitions of
data reconstruction attacks. We first propose a set of quantitative evaluation
metrics that consider important criteria such as quantifiability, consistency,
precision, and diversity. Additionally, we leverage large language models
(LLMs) as a substitute for human judgment, enabling visual evaluation with an
emphasis on high-quality reconstructions. Using our proposed taxonomy and
metrics, we present a unified framework for systematically evaluating the
strengths and limitations of existing attacks and establishing a benchmark for
future research. Empirical results, primarily from a memorization perspective,
not only validate the effectiveness of our metrics but also offer valuable
insights for designing new attacks.

*Silvia Lucia Sanna,Diego Soi,Davide Maiorca,Giorgio Giacinto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a green methodology for detecting IoT malware attacks using optimized tree-based ML models, balancing performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to resource constraints, and existing ML-based detection methods often overlook computational resource impact.

Method: Optimizes hyperparameters of Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Extra-Trees models based on energy consumption and performance metrics like Matthew's Correlation Coefficient.

Result: Models achieve high detection accuracy while reducing power usage, making them suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.

Conclusion: On-premise ML-based Intrusion Detection Systems are viable for IoT, offering both security and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely employed, and its usage is
growing exponentially because it facilitates remote monitoring, predictive
maintenance, and data-driven decision making, especially in the healthcare and
industrial sectors. However, IoT devices remain vulnerable due to their
resource constraints and difficulty in applying security patches. Consequently,
various cybersecurity attacks are reported daily, such as Denial of Service,
particularly in IoT-driven solutions. Most attack detection methodologies are
based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which can detect attack patterns.
However, the focus is more on identification rather than considering the impact
of ML algorithms on computational resources. This paper proposes a green
methodology to identify IoT malware networking attacks based on flow
privacy-preserving statistical features. In particular, the hyperparameters of
three tree-based models -- Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra-Trees -- are
optimized based on energy consumption and test-time performance in terms of
Matthew's Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that models maintain high
performance and detection accuracy while consistently reducing power usage in
terms of watt-hours (Wh). This suggests that on-premise ML-based Intrusion
Detection Systems are suitable for IoT and other resource-constrained devices.

Motivation: Active tensors occupy only a small fraction of GPU memory during LLM training, while inactive tensors remain unused for long periods, creating opportunities for offloading to SSDs without stalling training.

Method: TERAIO estimates tensor lifetimes via profiling, generates optimized offloading/prefetching plans, and integrates them into PyTorch. It uses GPUDirect storage for direct GPU-SSD tensor migration.

Result: TERAIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, achieving 1.47x average performance improvement and 80.7% of ideal unlimited GPU memory performance.

Conclusion: TERAIO effectively leverages SSD offloading for GPU memory expansion, significantly enhancing LLM training efficiency.

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor
offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based
solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for
large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its
design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small
fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training
iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a
long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching
tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO
accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each
tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.
With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor
offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via
PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the
offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor
migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and
maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art
studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves
the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves
80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

### [676] [pFedSOP : Accelerating Training Of Personalized Federated Learning Using Second-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07159)
*Mrinmay Sen,Chalavadi Krishna Mohan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: pFedSOP introduces second-order optimization in Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) to accelerate training and improve performance with fewer communication rounds, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PFL methods suffer from slow training due to first-order optimization and increased local computation, prompting the need for faster, more efficient solutions like second-order optimization.

Method: pFedSOP uses a Gompertz function-based normalized angle for personalized local gradient updates and a regularized Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a Hessian approximation for model updates.

Result: Experiments show pFedSOP outperforms state-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms on heterogeneous datasets with partial client participation.

Conclusion: pFedSOP effectively addresses the challenges of slow training and high communication costs in PFL, offering a promising solution for efficient personalized model training.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables clients to collaboratively
train personalized models tailored to their individual objectives, addressing
the challenge of model generalization in traditional Federated Learning (FL)
due to high data heterogeneity. However, existing PFL methods often require
increased communication rounds to achieve the desired performance, primarily
due to slow training caused by the use of first-order optimization, which has
linear convergence. Additionally, many of these methods increase local
computation because of the additional data fed into the model during the search
for personalized local models. One promising solution to this slow training is
second-order optimization, known for its quadratic convergence. However,
employing it in PFL is challenging due to the Hessian matrix and its inverse.
In this paper, we propose pFedSOP, which efficiently utilizes second-order
optimization in PFL to accelerate the training of personalized models and
enhance performance with fewer communication rounds. Our approach first
computes a personalized local gradient update using the Gompertz function-based
normalized angle between local and global gradient updates, incorporating
client-specific global information. We then use a regularized Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM), computed from this personalized gradient update, as
an approximation of the Hessian to update the personalized models. This
FIM-based second-order optimization speeds up training with fewer communication
rounds by tackling the challenges with exact Hessian and avoids additional data
being fed into the model during the search for personalized local models.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image classification
datasets with partial client participation demonstrate that pFedSOP outperforms
state-of-the-art FL and PFL algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing
financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often
hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time,
verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel
framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By

interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data,
thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More
critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's
analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated
data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed
financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible,
and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial
data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM
applications in finance.

*Dangxing Chen*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to fairly allocate risk in machine learning models using an extended Shapley value framework, addressing the need for interpretability in high-risk sectors like finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to interpret and fairly allocate risk in complex machine learning models, especially in high-risk sectors where understanding risk is as crucial as predictions.

Method: The method extends the Shapley value framework to allocate risk contributions of each feature in the model.

Result: The analysis and empirical examples show that risk can be effectively allocated using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the extended Shapley value framework provides a fair and interpretable way to allocate risk in machine learning models.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models have achieved great success at the
expense of highly complex black-box structures. By using axiomatic attribution
methods, we can fairly allocate the contributions of each feature, thus
allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as
finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work,
we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the
risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical
examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value
framework.

*Hans Buehler,Blanka Horvath,Yannick Limmer,Thorsten Schmidt*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to address model uncertainty in quantitative finance by enhancing traditional objectives with an outer uncertainty measure and proposing a subsampling strategy for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model uncertainty in finance leads to significant decision deviations due to reliance on empirical approximations of stochastic models.

Method: The approach combines an uncertainty measure with traditional objectives, uses subsampling for model uncertainty approximation, and employs a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for efficiency.

Result: The method outperforms traditional strategies, enhancing robustness against model risk and matching Bayesian methods in performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates model uncertainty, offering practical advantages in quantitative finance applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative
finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk
management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice,
the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an
empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant
deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al.
(2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected
utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer
"uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the
space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or
Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy,
analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch
sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the
quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted
stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization.
Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period,
real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty
measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our
model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against
model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian
methods.

Result: Verified existence and uniqueness of utility representations, equivalence to classical presentations, and precision at decision boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous computational foundation for decision theory applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive formalization of the von

theorem prover. We implement the classical axioms of preference-completeness,
transitivity, continuity, and independence-enabling machine-verified proofs of
both the existence and uniqueness of utility representations. Our formalization
captures the mathematical structure of preference relations over lotteries,
verifying that preferences satisfying the vNM axioms can be represented by
expected utility maximization.
  Our contributions include a granular implementation of the independence
axiom, formally verified proofs of fundamental claims about mixture lotteries,
constructive demonstrations of utility existence, and computational experiments
validating the results. We prove equivalence to classical presentations while
offering greater precision at decision boundaries.

### [682] [Depth-Optimal Quantum Layout Synthesis as SAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06752)
*Anna B. Jakobsen,Anders B. Clausen,Jaco van de Pol,Irfansha Shaik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient SAT encoding for Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis, focusing on minimizing circuit depth or CX-gate depth, achieving significant speedups. It also analyzes noise reduction correlations with CX-count and CX-depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum hardware imposes connectivity restrictions on CX gates, making Layout Synthesis crucial for transpiling circuits. Reducing CX count or depth is vital due to gate noise.

Method: The authors propose a new SAT encoding for Layout Synthesis, using incremental SAT solving and parallel plans to minimize depth or CX-depth, ensuring efficiency.

Result: The method achieves 10-100x speedups over OLSQ2 for depth-optimality. Minimizing CX-count correlates better with noise reduction, but combining CX-count and CX-depth yields the best results.

Conclusion: The new SAT encoding efficiently minimizes depth while highlighting the importance of balancing CX-count and CX-depth for optimal noise reduction in quantum circuits.

Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware
platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout
Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be
executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or
CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis
in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our
encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit
depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel
plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x
compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth
still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after
(CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count
correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However,
taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise
reduction.

TL;DR: A method for weighted homogeneous quantum ensembles using quantum classifiers is proposed, leveraging superposition and controlled unitaries for diverse data compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models in a quantum computing framework, ensuring diversity through quantum-parallel execution.

Method: Uses quantum classifiers with indexing registers for data encoding, enabling feature and training point subsampling via superposition and controlled unitaries. Integrates classical weight optimization for ensemble training.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the method's effectiveness, providing insights into its performance.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum ensemble method demonstrates potential for enhancing prediction accuracy in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Ensemble methods in machine learning aim to improve prediction accuracy by
combining multiple models. This is achieved by ensuring diversity among
predictors to capture different data aspects. Homogeneous ensembles use
identical models, achieving diversity through different data subsets, and
weighted-average ensembles assign higher influence to more accurate models
through a weight learning procedure. We propose a method to achieve a weighted
homogeneous quantum ensemble using quantum classifiers with indexing registers
for data encoding. This approach leverages instance-based quantum classifiers,
enabling feature and training point subsampling through superposition and
controlled unitaries, and allowing for a quantum-parallel execution of diverse
internal classifiers with different data compositions in superposition. The
method integrates a learning process involving circuit execution and classical
weight optimization, for a trained ensemble execution with weights encoded in
the circuit at test-time. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, offering insights into its performance.

Motivation: To demonstrate efficient generation of cubic-phase states, a key resource for universal quantum computing, using minimal non-Gaussian resources.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently generates high-quality cubic-phase states and enables direct quartic-phase gate production, advancing quantum computing capabilities.

Abstract: Cubic-phase states are a sufficient resource for universal quantum computing
over continuous variables. We present results from numerical experiments in
which deep neural networks are trained via reinforcement learning to control a

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-D12, a 12-item questionnaire to measure dependency on large language models (LLMs), identifying two factors: Instrumental and Relationship Dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for assessing LLM dependency are limited and based on behavioral addiction models, failing to capture the nuanced LLM-human relationship.

Method: The authors developed and validated LLM-D12 using a split-sample approach with 526 UK participants, performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.

Result: The scale revealed a two-factor structure (Instrumental and Relationship Dependency) with strong internal consistency and discriminant validity.

Conclusion: LLM-D12 provides a nuanced measure of LLM dependency, highlighting that reliance on LLMs may not be dysfunctional but could become problematic in certain contexts.

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large
language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even
addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals
may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic
behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this
as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and
warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed
and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred
to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with
items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in
the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate
halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a
two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship
Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which
individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and
cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs
as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor
structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant
validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the
distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and
structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view
that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still
reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

Result: LLMs' effectiveness varies by role and strategy, revealing potential for misuse and combating disinformation.

Conclusion: Advocates for balanced LLM development and platform design to empower users, foster trust, and mitigate risks of LLM-assisted disinformation.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a dual challenge in
the fight against disinformation. These powerful tools, capable of generating
human-like text at scale, can be weaponised to produce sophisticated and
persuasive disinformation, yet they also hold promise for enhancing detection
and mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the complex dynamics between
LLMs and disinformation through a communication game that simulates online
forums, inspired by the game Werewolf, with 25 participants. We analyse how
Disinformers, Moderators, and Users leverage LLMs to advance their goals,
revealing both the potential for misuse and combating disinformation. Our
findings highlight the varying uses of LLMs depending on the participants'
roles and strategies, underscoring the importance of understanding their
effectiveness in this context. We conclude by discussing implications for
future LLM development and online platform design, advocating for a balanced
approach that empowers users and fosters trust while mitigating the risks of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend participatory AI beyond primary stakeholders (end-users) to include secondary stakeholders, addressing gaps in current approaches.

Method: Semi-structured interviews to explore how secondary stakeholders realize participatory ideals.

Result: Identified three ideals (informedness, consent, agency) and stakeholder archetypes (reluctant data contributor, unsupported activist, well-intentioned practitioner) facing systemic barriers.

Conclusion: Envisions an AI future where secondary stakeholders meaningfully participate in AI systems they influence and are influenced by.

Abstract: As AI technologies become more human-facing, there have been numerous calls
to adapt participatory approaches to AI development -- spurring the idea of
participatory AI. However, these calls often focus only on primary
stakeholders, such as end-users, and not secondary stakeholders. This paper
seeks to translate the ideals of participatory AI to a broader population of
secondary AI stakeholders through semi-structured interviews. We theorize that
meaningful participation involves three participatory ideals: (1) informedness,
(2) consent, and (3) agency. We also explore how secondary stakeholders realize
these ideals by traversing a complicated problem space. Like walking up the
rungs of a ladder, these ideals build on one another. We introduce three
stakeholder archetypes: the reluctant data contributor, the unsupported
activist, and the well-intentioned practitioner, who must navigate systemic
barriers to achieving agentic AI relationships. We envision an AI future where
secondary stakeholders are able to meaningfully participate with the AI systems
they influence and are influenced by.

TL;DR: Delphyne, a pre-trained model for finance time-series, outperforms existing models with minimal fine-tuning, addressing challenges like lack of financial data and negative transfer effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-series pre-trained models underperform in financial applications due to insufficient financial data in pre-training and negative transfer effects from domain differences.

Method: Introduces Delphyne, a pre-trained model specifically for finance time-series, designed to handle noisy, continuous, and variable-frequency data.

Result: Delphyne matches or surpasses existing models with fewer fine-tuning steps and excels in various financial tasks.

Conclusion: Delphyne effectively addresses the limitations of current time-series models in finance, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is
particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting
patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on
historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of
time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets
and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across
financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown
boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and
fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial
data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to
inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore,
time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying
frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data
more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we
introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne
achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models
with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows
superior performances on various financial tasks.

Result: Transformer models show strong predictive performance, and XAI enhances interpretability for informed investment decisions.

Conclusion: The approach empowers individuals with accurate, interpretable stock predictions, fostering active financial market engagement.

Abstract: Financial literacy is increasingly dependent on the ability to interpret
complex financial data and utilize advanced forecasting tools. In this context,
this study proposes a novel approach that combines transformer-based time

interpretability and accuracy of stock price predictions. The analysis focuses
on the daily stock prices of the five highest-volume banks listed in the
BIST100 index, along with XBANK and XU100 indices, covering the period from
January 2015 to March 2025. Models including DLinear, LTSNet, Vanilla
Transformer, and Time Series Transformer are employed, with input features
enriched by technical indicators. SHAP and LIME techniques are used to provide
transparency into the influence of individual features on model outputs. The
results demonstrate the strong predictive capabilities of transformer models
and highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to empower
individuals in making informed investment decisions and actively engaging in
financial markets.

Motivation: To leverage NLP for extracting predictive signals from financial news and quantify media attention's impact on stock performance.

Method: Constructs two versions of the Hype Index (News Count-Based and Capitalization Adjusted) for S&P 100 stocks/sectors, analyzing their associations with returns, volatility, and market signals.

Result: The Hype Index family proves useful for stock volatility analysis, market signaling, and NLP applications in finance.

Conclusion: The Hype Index offers valuable tools for financial analysis, demonstrating the potential of NLP in quantifying media impact on markets.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)

*Zonghan Wu,Junlin Wang,Congyuan Zou,Chenhan Wang,Yilei Shao*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: FinAR-Bench is a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in financial statement analysis, breaking the task into three steps for precise assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't reflect real-world financial tasks like generating analysis reports, risking inaccuracies with significant consequences.

Method: Proposes FinAR-Bench, focusing on financial statement analysis, evaluated through three steps: information extraction, indicator calculation, and logical reasoning.

Result: Provides a structured way to assess LLMs' performance in fundamental analysis, highlighting strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: FinAR-Bench offers a practical benchmark for LLMs in real-world financial tasks, improving accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to
transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense
of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the
automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for
making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding
corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a
single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead
to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing
financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions
but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial
analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark
dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of
fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we
break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information,
calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This
structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each
step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current
strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical
way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.

### [692] [Deep regularization networks for inverse problems with noisy operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07008)
*Fatemeh Pourahmadian,Yang Xu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A supervised learning method accelerates spatiotemporal regularization for inverse problems, using a neural operator to map patterns to regularization parameters, improving real-time imaging quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time imaging in large inverse problems by accelerating regularization, especially in superresolution imaging via inverse scattering theory.

Method: A neural operator is trained in two steps: (1) on low-resolution maps using the Morozov discrepancy principle, and (2) optimizing via Tikhonov loss. Adaptive loss weight selection is introduced.

Result: The method accelerates imaging and enhances image quality, particularly in complex environments like damage evolution in elastic plates.

Conclusion: Discrepancy-informed regularization networks improve both speed and quality of imaging, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: A supervised learning approach is proposed for regularization of large
inverse problems where the main operator is built from noisy data. This is
germane to superresolution imaging via the sampling indicators of the inverse
scattering theory. We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization
process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this
approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the
scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is
trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution
regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with
nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through
minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss.
Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward
construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning
from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the
optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data,
quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We
highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's
generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the
logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case,
the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new
method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training
without requiring an additional optimization process. The proposed approach is
synthetically examined for imaging damage evolution in an elastic plate. The
results indicate that the discrepancy-informed regularization networks not only
accelerate the imaging process, but also remarkably enhance the image quality
in complex environments.

### [693] [Noise Consistency Regularization for Improved Subject-Driven Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06483)
*Yao Ni,Song Wen,Piotr Koniusz,Anoop Cherian*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes two auxiliary consistency losses to improve fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion, addressing underfitting and overfitting issues, enhancing subject identity preservation and image diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for Stable Diffusion suffer from underfitting (failing to capture subject identity) and overfitting (memorizing subject images, reducing background diversity).

Method: Introduces two consistency losses: prior consistency regularization (maintains noise prediction fidelity for non-subject images) and subject consistency regularization (enhances robustness to noise-modulated latent codes).

Result: Outperforms DreamBooth in CLIP scores, background variation, and visual quality, preserving subject identity while improving diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed losses effectively address fine-tuning challenges, improving both subject fidelity and image diversity in Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

TL;DR: Vid2Sim is a novel framework for reconstructing geometry and physical properties from videos using a mesh-free, efficient approach based on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos are computationally expensive and require extensive tuning, limiting practicality and generalizability.

Method: Vid2Sim uses a feed-forward neural network to reconstruct observed configurations, followed by lightweight optimization to refine appearance, geometry, and physical properties. It enables efficient, mesh-free simulation post-reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing geometry and physical properties from videos.

Conclusion: Vid2Sim offers a generalizable, efficient solution for video-based reconstruction of physical systems, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper leverages repetitive elements in 3D scenes to enhance novel view synthesis by improving reconstruction of low-quality areas due to poor coverage or occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS improve novel view synthesis, but unseen or occluded parts remain low-quality without exhaustive training views. Repetitive elements in scenes can address this limitation.

Method: The method segments repeated instances in 3DGS, registers them, and shares information among instances, improving geometry and accounting for appearance variations.

Result: The approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality in synthetic and real scenes with repetitive elements.

Conclusion: Leveraging repetitive elements in 3D scenes effectively improves reconstruction and synthesis quality for occluded or poorly covered areas.

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an architecture-algorithm co-design to optimize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices, reducing computation and energy costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time rendering of 3DGS on power- and area-constrained devices is challenging due to inefficiencies in conventional rasterization and sorting processes.

Method: Proposes axis-oriented rasterization to reduce redundant computations, a neural sorting approach to replace hardware sorters, and a reconfigurable processing array for efficient hardware utilization. Also introduces a tile schedule for memory optimization.

Result: Achieves 23.4-27.8x speedup and 28.8-51.4x energy savings compared to edge GPUs, preserving rendering quality.

Conclusion: The co-design effectively addresses inefficiencies in 3DGS, enabling high-quality real-time rendering on constrained devices, with plans to open-source the design.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

*Lei Li,Angela Dai*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: HOI-PAGE synthesizes 4D human-object interactions (HOIs) from text prompts using part-level affordance reasoning, improving realism and diversity over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works focus on global motion, but finer-grained part-level understanding is needed for realistic and diverse HOIs.

Method: Introduces Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs) from LLMs to guide a three-stage synthesis: object decomposition, reference video generation, and motion optimization.

Result: Generates complex multi-object/person interactions with improved realism and text alignment.

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE advances zero-shot 4D HOI synthesis by leveraging part-level reasoning and structured representations.

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment
for zero-shot 4D HOI generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PIG introduces a method for precise 3D object segmentation and multi-material interaction in 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving visual quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with inaccurate segmentation, imprecise deformation, and rendering artifacts in object interactions.

Method: Combines 3D object segmentation with multi-material interaction simulation, mapping 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians and embedding constraint scales into deformation gradients.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in visual quality and enables physically realistic scene generation.

Conclusion: PIG advances the field by addressing key challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting and offering new directions for realistic scene generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

TL;DR: A lightweight generative model enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting resolution and fidelity beyond native training limits using Hessian-assisted sampling for real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are limited by input resolution, unable to extrapolate finer details than training views provide.

Method: A generative model predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians, guided by Hessian-assisted sampling to identify regions needing densification.

Result: Achieves real-time performance (0.015s per inference) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy and rendering quality.

Conclusion: Introduces a resolution-free 3D scene enhancement paradigm, combining efficiency and high-quality results.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpeeDe3DGS accelerates dynamic 3DGS rendering by pruning low-contribution Gaussians and clustering motion, achieving significant speed and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3DGS methods are slow due to per-Gaussian neural inference, limiting rendering speed and increasing resource demands.

Method: Proposes temporal sensitivity pruning and GroupFlow for motion clustering to reduce neural inference and improve efficiency.

Result: Achieves 10.37× faster rendering, 7.71× smaller model size, and 2.71× shorter training time on NeRF-DS, with similar gains on other datasets.

Conclusion: SpeeDe3DGS is a modular, efficient solution for dynamic 3DGS, enhancing rendering speed and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient 3D data compression while leveraging existing pre-trained models and avoiding reliance on large 3D datasets.

Method: Uses trainable mapping networks to bridge latent spaces of pre-trained encoders and generative models, enabling compression and decompression of 3D data formats (meshes, point clouds, radiance fields).

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 2187x for meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields with minimal latency and preserved visual quality.

Conclusion: Squeeze3D offers a flexible, efficient solution for 3D data compression by leveraging pre-trained models and synthetic data.

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, a standardized benchmark for active tactile perception tasks, aiming to bridge gaps in tactile sensing and active perception research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing enhances robotic manipulation but lacks spatial awareness. Active perception can address this, but both fields lack standardized benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, including simulation scenarios and a dataset of synthetic and real-world tactile samples, along with a CycleGAN for realistic rendering.

Result: The benchmark offers diverse tasks (localization, classification, volume estimation) and a dataset of 13,500 synthetic and 153,600 real-world samples.

Conclusion: The suite provides standardized protocols and reproducible frameworks to advance tactile sensing and active perception research.

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous
robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or
substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because
tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that
require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A
human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception
techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more
informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in
order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and
different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention
recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an
open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active
tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume
estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from
simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using
vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive
dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600
real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this
dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By
providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to
operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and
validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic
nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel
framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative
assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g.,
safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning)
to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously
evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability
requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an
autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our
results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages
performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby
offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&V in safety- and
security-critical systems.

Motivation: Traditional on-board and cloud-based object detection methods for CAVs face limitations in accuracy and latency, necessitating a new approach for real-time, reliable perception.

Method: The ECOD framework integrates two algorithms: PACE for multi-CAV data aggregation and VOTE for consensus-based object classification, both operating at the edge for low-latency processing.

Result: Experimental results show ECOD improves object classification accuracy by up to 75% over single-perspective methods while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: ECOD demonstrates the potential of edge computing to enhance collaborative perception in latency-sensitive autonomous systems like CAVs.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: ATENA is a test-time active learning framework for Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) that improves uncertainty calibration via episodic feedback and mixture entropy optimization, outperforming baselines on VLN benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline-trained VLN policies degrade in unfamiliar environments due to overconfidence and lack of contextual grounding. ATENA addresses this by enabling human-robot interaction and active learning.

Method: ATENA uses mixture entropy optimization (combining action and pseudo-expert distributions) and a self-active learning strategy to improve uncertainty calibration and decision-making.

Result: ATENA outperforms baselines on VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, R2R-CE) by overcoming distributional shifts and improving task performance.

Conclusion: ATENA enhances VLN policy adaptability and performance in unfamiliar environments through active learning and uncertainty calibration.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often
exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation
environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access
to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,
it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in
incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time
active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via
episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns
to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,
improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy
optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and
pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the
agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence
and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy
that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident
predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all
iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive
evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate
that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,
outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAIL, a self-improving video model for robotic tasks, leveraging internet-scale pretrained models and online self-collected data to enhance generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalization in video generative models for unseen robotic tasks by enabling continuous online improvement.

Method: Introduces the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself using self-produced trajectories and internet-scale pretrained data.

Result: SAIL shows continuous performance improvements on novel tasks in MetaWorld and real robot arm tasks, proving robust to filtering and initial demonstration quality.

Conclusion: SAIL successfully bootstraps a high-performance video model for novel robotic tasks through self-improvement and adaptation.

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized
as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks.
However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved
generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from
additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video
datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can
continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this
work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an
in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories,
collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and
steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply
SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks
on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge
over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original
in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is
surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is
filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through
adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online
experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a
high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through
self-improvement.

TL;DR: DriveSuprim improves autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction by using a coarse-to-fine filtering method, rotation-based augmentation, and self-distillation, achieving top performance in safety and trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current selection-based methods for autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction struggle with optimization and robustness in rare scenarios, limiting safety assessment.

Method: DriveSuprim employs a coarse-to-fine candidate filtering, rotation-based augmentation for robustness, and a self-distillation framework for stable training.

Result: DriveSuprim achieves 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2, excelling in safety-critical tasks like collision avoidance.

Conclusion: DriveSuprim advances trajectory prediction by enhancing safety and robustness, outperforming existing methods without additional data.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

TL;DR: RoboPARA is an LLM-driven framework for dual-arm task parallelism planning, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to optimize task parallelism in dual-arm robots, limiting their potential.

Method: RoboPARA uses a two-stage process: dependency graph-based planning and graph re-traversal for parallel planning, along with the X-DAPT dataset for evaluation.

Result: RoboPARA achieves higher efficiency and reliability, especially in complex tasks, as shown on the X-DAPT dataset.

Conclusion: RoboPARA advances dual-arm task parallelism, with code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility
in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved
promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task
parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this
issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework
for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process:
(1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate
redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which
optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task
coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task
dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate
dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels.
Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and
reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: NightHawk optimizes robot vision in dim, featureless subterranean environments using active illumination and exposure control via Bayesian optimization, improving feature detection by 47-197%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subterranean environments like culverts challenge robot vision due to poor lighting and lack of features, while onboard illumination causes issues like reflections and power drain.

Method: NightHawk uses Bayesian optimization to dynamically adjust light intensity and exposure time, guided by a novel feature detector-based metric.

Result: Field tests showed a 47-197% improvement in feature detection and matching, enhancing visual estimation in low-light conditions.

Conclusion: NightHawk effectively addresses subterranean vision challenges, enabling reliable robot navigation in dim, featureless environments.

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

*Chenguang Huang,Oier Mees,Andy Zeng,Wolfram Burgard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes multimodal spatial language maps (VLMaps and AVLMaps) to fuse pretrained multimodal features with 3D environment reconstructions, enabling robots to ground language and multimodal goals for navigation and interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between language grounding and environment mapping, lack of spatial precision, and neglect of non-visual modalities in previous approaches.

Method: Autonomously build visual-language maps (VLMaps) and audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) by fusing pretrained multimodal features with 3D reconstructions. Use large language models (LLMs) for natural language command translation and obstacle map generation.

Result: Enables zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation, improves recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios, and supports diverse robot embodiments.

Conclusion: Multimodal spatial language maps enhance navigation and interaction by integrating visual, audio, and language cues, demonstrating effectiveness in simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GTRS is a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning in autonomous driving, combining coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation to overcome limitations of static and dynamic trajectory scoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory scorers struggle with generalization—static vocabularies lack fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals miss broader distributions. GTRS aims to unify these approaches.

Method: GTRS integrates a diffusion-based trajectory generator, vocabulary generalization with dropout, and sensor augmentation for robust scoring.

Result: GTRS won the Navsim v2 Challenge, showing superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, nearing ground-truth methods.

Conclusion: GTRS provides a robust solution for trajectory scoring in autonomous driving, balancing diversity and precision.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks underutilize VLMs' semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning capabilities, focusing mainly on reactive policies.

Method: Introduces RoboCerebra with a simulation dataset, hierarchical VLM-VLA framework, and GPT-generated task instructions executed by humans in simulation.

Result: RoboCerebra offers longer action sequences and denser annotations, benchmarking VLMs for System 2 capabilities.

Conclusion: RoboCerebra advances the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners by addressing System 2 reasoning gaps.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of controlling high-speed objects in real-world robotics, exemplified by table tennis, requires advanced vision and strategic planning.

Method: Combines SONIC (spike camera-based module) for precise ball-racket contact prediction and IMPACT (strategic planning module) for accurate ball placement, using a 20 kHz spike camera and neural networks.

Result: Achieves 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy and 71% for 20 cm accuracy, outperforming prior methods by 38% and 37%.

Conclusion: SpikePingpong advances robotic control in high-speed tasks, enabling sophisticated gameplay strategies.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

TL;DR: CARoL is a framework for efficient robotic task learning by leveraging prior knowledge through context-aware adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning new robotic tasks from scratch with RL is inefficient, and integrating prior knowledge poses challenges in relevancy and adaptive integration.

Method: CARoL analyzes state transitions to identify task similarities, prioritizes relevant prior knowledge, and adapts it for the new task. It works with policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL algorithms.

Result: CARoL shows faster convergence and higher rewards in simulations (CarRacing, LunarLander) and enables real-world ground vehicles to adapt simulation-learned policies efficiently.

Conclusion: CARoL effectively enhances learning efficiency by context-aware adaptation of prior knowledge, demonstrating success in both simulations and real-world applications.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn new robotic tasks from scratch is
often inefficient. Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to
significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical
challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to
adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose
Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to
efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL
incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system
dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It
then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific
knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad
applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL
algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both
simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations
include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster
convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In
real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly
and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse
real-world off-road terrain.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide task planning in Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP) problems, combining LLM-generated plans with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for efficient and effective solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional G-TAMP approaches require significant computational resources or data, while humans use common sense. The paper aims to leverage LLMs' common sense knowledge for intuitive task planning.

Method: The authors design a predicate-based prompt for LLMs to perform geometric reasoning, generate task plans, and use MCTS with a hybrid action space to refine these plans.

Result: The method outperforms previous LLM planners and pure search algorithms on six G-TAMP problems.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with MCTS provides an efficient and effective solution for G-TAMP problems, leveraging common sense and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: The problem of relocating a set of objects to designated areas amidst movable
obstacles can be framed as a Geometric Task and Motion Planning (G-TAMP)
problem, a subclass of task and motion planning (TAMP). Traditional approaches
to G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning
from planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand
significant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use
common sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP
problems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide
task planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric
reasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric
information derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to
generate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of
continuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing
to LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action
space and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that
calls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to
warm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.
On six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM
planners and pure search algorithms. Code can be found at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MapBERT is a novel framework using BitVAE and a masked transformer to model unseen indoor spaces, improving semantic map generation for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time or generalize to new environments, necessitating a better solution for spatial awareness in embodied agents.

Method: MapBERT employs a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into bitwise tokens and uses a masked transformer to infer missing regions. An object-aware masking strategy enhances object-centric reasoning.

Result: Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show MapBERT achieves state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MapBERT effectively models unseen spaces, improving spatial reasoning for robotic tasks.

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

TL;DR: BitVLA is the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics, achieving efficient performance with minimal memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying large VLA models on resource-constrained robotic systems by exploring 1-bit pretraining.

Method: Introduces BitVLA, a ternary parameter model, and a distillation-aware training strategy to compress the vision encoder to 1.58-bit weights.

Result: BitVLA matches state-of-the-art performance with 4-bit quantization while using only 29.8% of memory.

Conclusion: BitVLA demonstrates potential for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices, with code and weights publicly released.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

Motivation: VLA models rely on expert demonstrations, limiting their ability to correct and learn from failures. HAPO addresses this by integrating human intervention for failure correction and preference optimization.

Method: HAPO uses a human-robot collaboration framework to collect intervention trajectories and employs an adaptive reweighting algorithm for preference optimization, addressing irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world scenarios demonstrate HAPO's superior generalization and robustness in various manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: HAPO enables reliable deployment and effective learning from failures for VLA models, enhancing their adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential
for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic
deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial
capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method
named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective
adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with
a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and
interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These
human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action
preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure
action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically,
we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of
irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing
preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from
binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these
modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures
reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The
experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior
generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation
tasks.

### [721] [Real-Time Execution of Action Chunking Flow Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07339)
*Kevin Black,Manuel Y. Galliker,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel inference-time algorithm, real-time chunking (RTC), addresses latency in AI systems by enabling smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies, improving task throughput and robustness to delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in state-of-the-art generalist models, like VLAs, causes pauses or jerky movements, hindering real-time performance in dynamic tasks.

Method: RTC generates the next action chunk while executing the current one, freezing guaranteed actions and inpainting the rest, without requiring re-training.

Result: RTC significantly improves task throughput and success rates in dynamic and precise tasks, even with latency.

Conclusion: RTC is a fast, performant, and robust solution for real-time AI systems, validated in both simulated and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Modern AI systems, especially those interacting with the physical world,
increasingly require real-time performance. However, the high latency of
state-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action
models (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled
temporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address
the latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements
at chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that
enables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies. Our method,
real-time chunking (RTC), is applicable to any diffusion- or flow-based VLA out
of the box with no re-training. It generates the next action chunk while
executing the current one, "freezing" actions guaranteed to execute and
"inpainting" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly
dynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging
real-world bimanual manipulation tasks. Results demonstrate that RTC is fast,
performant, and uniquely robust to inference delay, significantly improving
task throughput and enabling high success rates in precise tasks
$\unicode{x2013}$ such as lighting a match $\unicode{x2013}$ even in the
presence of significant latency. See

### [722] [Machine Learning-Based Self-Localization Using Internal Sensors for Automating Bulldozers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07271)
*Hikaru Sawafuji,Ryota Ozaki,Takuto Motomura,Toyohisa Matsuda,Masanori Tojima,Kento Uchida,Shinichi Shirakawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers is proposed to address RTK-GNSS signal loss, using internal sensors and EKF for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTK-GNSS signals are unreliable in certain mining conditions, necessitating alternative self-localization methods for bulldozers.

Method: The method involves estimating local velocities via machine learning from internal sensors and integrating these into an EKF for global localization.

Result: The method reduced position error accumulation, especially during slip, and bulldozer-specific sensors enhanced accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a viable alternative to RTK-GNSS, improving bulldozer self-localization in challenging environments.

Abstract: Self-localization is an important technology for automating bulldozers.
Conventional bulldozer self-localization systems rely on RTK-GNSS (Real Time
Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite Systems). However, RTK-GNSS signals are
sometimes lost in certain mining conditions. Therefore, self-localization
methods that do not depend on RTK-GNSS are required. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based self-localization method for bulldozers. The proposed
method consists of two steps: estimating local velocities using a machine
learning model from internal sensors, and incorporating these estimates into an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for global localization. We also created a novel
dataset for bulldozer odometry and conducted experiments across various driving
scenarios, including slalom, excavation, and driving on slopes. The result
demonstrated that the proposed self-localization method suppressed the
accumulation of position errors compared to kinematics-based methods,
especially when slip occurred. Furthermore, this study showed that
bulldozer-specific sensors, such as blade position sensors and hydraulic
pressure sensors, contributed to improving self-localization accuracy.

Motivation: To enable robots to execute complex tasks in large-scale environments by combining mapping, localization, and planning using a shared 3D scene graph and natural language instructions.

Method: The system builds a shared 3D scene graph for multi-robot fusion, supports real-time relocalization, and uses an LLM to translate natural language into PDDL goals for planning.

Result: Experimental assessment shows successful performance in real-world, large-scale outdoor tasks.

Conclusion: The system effectively integrates 3D scene graphs and LLMs for multi-robot task execution in complex environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-robot system that integrates mapping,
localization, and task and motion planning (TAMP) enabled by 3D scene graphs to
execute complex instructions expressed in natural language. Our system builds a
shared 3D scene graph incorporating an open-set object-based map, which is
leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports
real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and
planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about
their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a
planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain
Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by
leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We
provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on
real-world tasks in large-scale, outdoor environments.

*Peiyan Li,Yixiang Chen,Hongtao Wu,Xiao Ma,Xiangnan Wu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang,Tao Kong,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BridgeVLA is a 3D vision-language-action model that projects 3D inputs to 2D images and uses 2D heatmaps for action prediction, improving sample efficiency and outperforming baselines in simulation and real-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vision-language-action models often neglect 3D spatial structure, leading to inefficiency. BridgeVLA addresses this by aligning 3D inputs with 2D VLM backbones and unifying input-output spaces.

Method: BridgeVLA projects 3D inputs to 2D images and predicts actions via 2D heatmaps. It includes scalable pre-training to equip the VLM backbone for heatmap prediction before policy learning.

Result: BridgeVLA outperforms baselines in simulation (RLBench, COLOSSEUM, GemBench) and real-robot tasks, achieving higher success rates and robustness in out-of-distribution settings. It shows exceptional sample efficiency (96.8% success with 3 trajectories per task).

Conclusion: BridgeVLA effectively integrates 3D signals into VLMs, improving manipulation learning efficiency and performance, with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building
vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to
effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D
signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the
spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D
inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,
and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and
output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a
scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability
to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments
show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and
effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across
three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate
from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better
performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average
success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing
baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,
BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It
generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual
disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a
success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,
highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the learning process and enhance flexibility in neural networks by avoiding analytically determined weights and thresholds.

Method: Transforms metric-based networks to use pair-based image recognition for training, eliminating the need for analytical weight calculations.

Result: Simplifies training, allows easy network expansion, and maintains advantages like architecture transparency and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and scalable solution for neural network training and expansion.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly
determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and
thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions
of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions
used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in
order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical
expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is
carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the
learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new
images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including
such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training

*Viorica Rozina Chifu,Tudor Cioara,Cristina Bianca Pop,Ionut Anghel*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A decentralized energy cooperation model for microgrids uses evolutionary algorithms to achieve stable energy trading, with 95% success in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable local decision-making and energy balance in microgrid communities through autonomous agent strategies.

Method: Microgrids act as agents using Hawk or Dove strategies. Evolutionary algorithms model interactions, with recombination and mutation operators applied to energy trading matrices. A multi-criteria fitness function evaluates outcomes.

Result: 95 out of 100 microgrids achieved stable energy states in simulations, confirming the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized model successfully balances energy at both individual and community levels.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between
microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid
community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk
or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and
its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and
buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual
in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that
encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.
The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.
Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation
is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The
evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that
considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community
level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the
degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated
scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,
to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of
microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the
100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the
individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs reduces computational costs by focusing on promising lower-level tasks using a contrastive ranking network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization is computationally expensive due to redundant evaluations of unpromising lower-level tasks, even with existing multitasking and transfer learning methods.

Method: Proposes a contrastive ranking network to learn relational patterns between upper- and lower-level solutions, guiding a reference-based ranking strategy for task prioritization and adaptive resampling.

Result: The framework significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining or improving solution accuracy across five bilevel algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes to enhance bilevel EA efficiency, enabling more scalable bilevel optimization.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its
nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a
corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are
effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands
remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous
unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and
transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a
novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies
and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a
contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired
upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a
reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and
adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality.
Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show
that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving --
or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable
strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more
scalable bilevel optimization.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study identifies a biologically plausible learning rule (e-prop) that matches Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in neural data similarity and task accuracy, emphasizing the role of model architecture and initial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in assessing biologically plausible learning rules by evaluating their alignment with neural recordings, beyond just task performance.

Method: Procrustes analysis on neuroscience datasets to compare e-prop and BPTT, focusing on neural similarity and task accuracy.

Result: e-prop achieves neural data similarity comparable to BPTT when matched for accuracy; model architecture and initial conditions influence similarity more than the learning rule.

Conclusion: Biologically plausible learning rules like e-prop can achieve both competitive task performance and neural data similarity, marking significant progress in brain modeling.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically
plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.

Motivation: The complexity and manual effort in atomistic simulations hinder progress in chemistry and materials science, necessitating automation.

Method: ChemGraph uses graph neural networks for calculations and LLMs for task planning, offering methods from tight-binding to DFT.

Result: Smaller LLMs handle simple tasks well, while complex tasks benefit from larger models; task decomposition improves smaller models' performance.

Conclusion: ChemGraph successfully automates workflows, with smaller LLMs matching larger models when tasks are decomposed.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models focus on image-based diagnostics, neglecting audio features. The paper addresses noise challenges in audio data for depression diagnosis.

Method: RBA-FE uses six acoustic features and an improved spiking neuron model (ARSLIF) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, enhancing noise robustness.

Result: RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 0.8974 accuracy on MODMA) and shows improved noise robustness on AVEC2014 and DAIC-WOZ datasets.

Conclusion: The ARSLIF model provides interpretability and robustness, highlighting abnormal firing patterns in depressive audio data.

Abstract: This article proposes a robust brain-inspired audio feature extractor
(RBA-FE) model for depression diagnosis, using an improved hierarchical network
architecture. Most deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance
for image-based diagnostic tasks, ignoring the counterpart audio features. In
order to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features
extracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and
temporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision
limitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep
residual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model
incorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth
leaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of
``retuning of cellular signal selectivity" in the brain attention systems,
which enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.
Experimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
on the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in
precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014
and DAIC-WOZ datasets both show enhancements in noise robustness. It is further
indicated by comparison that the ARSLIF neuron model suggest the abnormal
firing pattern within the feature extraction on depressive audio data, offering
brain-inspired interpretability.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal post-correction framework improves ASR accuracy in complex TV series environments by leveraging video-based contextual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle in complex environments like TV series due to overlapping speech, domain-specific terms, and contextual dependencies. Existing multimodal methods fail to utilize video context effectively.

Method: The framework has two stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction. It uses a Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) for contextual extraction and a Large Language Model (LLM) for refinement.

Result: The method improves ASR performance on a TV series benchmark by enhancing transcription accuracy with video-based context.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses ASR challenges in complex multimedia environments by integrating video context.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved remarkable success with deep
learning, driving advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, media
transcription, and assistive technologies. However, ASR systems still struggle
in complex environments such as TV series, where overlapping speech,
domain-specific terminology, and long-range contextual dependencies pose
significant challenges to transcription accuracy. Existing multimodal
approaches fail to correct ASR outputs with the rich temporal and contextual
information available in video. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
multimodal post-correction framework that refines ASR transcriptions by
leveraging contextual cues extracted from video. Our framework consists of two
stages: ASR Generation and Video-based Post-Correction, where the first stage
produces the initial transcript and the second stage corrects errors using
Video-based Contextual Information Extraction and Context-aware ASR Correction.
We employ the Video-Large Multimodal Model (VLMM) to extract key contextual
information using tailored prompts, which is then integrated with a Large
Language Model (LLM) to refine the ASR output. We evaluate our method on a
multimodal benchmark for TV series ASR and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving ASR performance by leveraging video-based context to enhance
transcription accuracy in complex multimedia environments.

*Kuiyuan Zhang,Wenjie Pei,Rushi Lan,Yifang Guo,Zhongyun Hua*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight single-stream network for audio-visual deepfake detection, emphasizing efficient multi-modal feature fusion and reduced redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize audio-visual correlations and are inefficient due to redundant sub-models.

Method: A single-stream framework with collaborative audio-visual learning blocks and a multi-modal classification module.

Result: Achieves superior performance with only 0.48M parameters, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The lightweight design is effective for detecting uni-modal, multi-modal, and unseen deepfakes.

Abstract: Deepfakes are AI-synthesized multimedia data that may be abused for spreading
misinformation. Deepfake generation involves both visual and audio
manipulation. To detect audio-visual deepfakes, previous studies commonly
employ two relatively independent sub-models to learn audio and visual
features, respectively, and fuse them subsequently for deepfake detection.
However, this may underutilize the inherent correlations between audio and
visual features. Moreover, utilizing two isolated feature learning sub-models
can result in redundant neural layers, making the overall model inefficient and
impractical for resource-constrained environments.
  In this work, we design a lightweight network for audio-visual deepfake
detection via a single-stream multi-modal learning framework. Specifically, we
introduce a collaborative audio-visual learning block to efficiently integrate
multi-modal information while learning the visual and audio features. By
iteratively employing this block, our single-stream network achieves a
continuous fusion of multi-modal features across its layers. Thus, our network
efficiently captures visual and audio features without the need for excessive
block stacking, resulting in a lightweight network design. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-modal classification module that can boost the dependence of
the visual and audio classifiers on modality content. It also enhances the
whole resistance of the video classifier against the mismatches between audio
and visual modalities. We conduct experiments on the DF-TIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and
DFDC benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art audio-visual joint
detection methods, our method is significantly lightweight with only 0.48M
parameters, yet it achieves superiority in both uni-modal and multi-modal
deepfakes, as well as in unseen types of deepfakes.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses the ill-posed problem of inverting audio synthesizer parameters from sound, focusing on permutation invariance. It proposes a generative model and permutation-equivariant flow to improve performance, validated on a real-world synthesizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inversion from sound to synthesizer parameters is ill-posed due to intrinsic symmetries like permutation invariance, degrading regression performance.

Method: Uses a conditional generative model and permutation-equivariant continuous normalizing flow, with a relaxed equivariance strategy for real-world synthesizers.

Result: Outperforms regression and generative baselines in audio reconstruction metrics on the Surge XT synthesizer.

Conclusion: Acknowledging symmetries and using equivariant models improves inversion performance, with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Many audio synthesizers can produce the same signal given different parameter
configurations, meaning the inversion from sound to parameters is an inherently
ill-posed problem. We show that this is largely due to intrinsic symmetries of
the synthesizer, and focus in particular on permutation invariance. First, we
demonstrate on a synthetic task that regressing point estimates under
permutation symmetry degrades performance, even when using a
permutation-invariant loss function or symmetry-breaking heuristics. Then,
viewing equivalent solutions as modes of a probability distribution, we show
that a conditional generative model substantially improves performance.
Further, acknowledging the invariance of the implicit parameter distribution,
we find that performance is further improved by using a permutation equivariant
continuous normalizing flow. To accommodate intricate symmetries in real
synthesizers, we also propose a relaxed equivariance strategy that adaptively
discovers relevant symmetries from data. Applying our method to Surge XT, a
full-featured open source synthesizer used in real world audio production, we
find our method outperforms regression and generative baselines across audio
reconstruction metrics.

*Xuanjun Chen,I-Ming Lin,Lin Zhang,Haibin Wu,Hung-yi Lee,Jyh-Shing Roger Jang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SASTNet improves source tracing for deepfake speech by combining semantic and acoustic features, outperforming models trained on codec-resynthesized data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for tracing deepfake speech generated by neural audio codec models perform poorly, especially when trained on simulated data.

Method: Introduces SASTNet, which uses Whisper for semantic features and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic features.

Result: SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CodecFake+ dataset.

Conclusion: SASTNet effectively addresses generalization issues in source tracing for deepfake speech.

Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech
(CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG)
models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source
tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance
on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show
that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to
non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate
these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network
(SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and
Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LeVo is an LM-based framework for lyrics-to-song generation, addressing challenges like sound quality and vocal-instrument harmony through parallel token modeling and multi-preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with song composition complexity and data scarcity, limiting sound quality and musicality.

Method: LeVo uses LeLM (parallel modeling of mixed and dual-track tokens) and a music codec, enhanced by DPO-based multi-preference alignment.

Result: LeVo outperforms existing methods in objective and subjective metrics, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: LeVo effectively improves lyrics-to-song generation, with modular design and preference alignment proving successful.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models
have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song
generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex
composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to
limitations in sound quality, musicality, instruction following, and
vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an
LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of
parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the
combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony,
and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for
high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a
modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different
token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following, we
introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a
semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training. Experimental
results demonstrate that LeVo consistently outperforms existing methods on both
objective and subjective metrics. Ablation studies further justify the
effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples are available at

### [737] [ResPF: Residual Poisson Flow for Efficient and Physically Consistent Sparse-View CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06400)
*Changsheng Fang,Yongtong Liu,Bahareh Morovati,Shuo Han,Yu Shi,Li Zhou,Shuyi Fan,Hengyong Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models improve sparse-view CT reconstruction by integrating conditional guidance and a residual fusion module, achieving high quality, efficiency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT reduces radiation dose but poses reconstruction challenges. Existing methods lack interpretability or are computationally expensive.

Method: ResPF combines PFGM++ with conditional guidance, skips redundant sampling steps, and uses a residual fusion module to maintain trajectory continuity.

Result: ResPF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality, speed, and robustness on synthetic and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: ResPF is the first Poisson flow model for sparse-view CT, offering a promising solution for efficient and accurate reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

### [738] [SPC to 3D: Novel View Synthesis from Binary SPC via I2I translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06890)
*Sumit Sharma,Gopi Raju Matta,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework converts binary Single Photon Camera (SPC) images into high-quality colorized novel views using generative models and 3D reconstruction techniques, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The binary nature of SPC images causes severe information loss, making traditional 3D synthesis ineffective. Addressing this can enhance 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery.

Method: A modular two-stage framework: 1) Image-to-image translation (Pix2PixHD) converts binary SPC inputs to RGB. 2) 3D scene reconstruction (NeRF/3DGS) generates novel views.

Result: The pipeline (Pix2PixHD + NeRF/3DGS) shows significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of binary SPC data, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

### [739] [Optimal Transport Driven Asymmetric Image-to-Image Translation for Nuclei Segmentation of Histological Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07023)
*Suman Mahapatra,Pradipta Maji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep generative model for nuclei segmentation in histological images addresses information asymmetry between domains using an invertible generator and optimal transport, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclei segmentation aids disease diagnosis, but current image-to-image translation models fail with asymmetric information between domains.

Method: Proposes an invertible generator with optimal transport and measure theory, eliminating cycle-consistency loss and using a spatially-constrained squeeze operation.

Result: The model achieves better performance with lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively segments nuclei in histological images, balancing complexity and performance.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

### [740] [SiliCoN: Simultaneous Nuclei Segmentation and Color Normalization of Histological Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07028)
*Suman Mahapatra,Pradipta Maji*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep generative model is proposed for simultaneous nuclei segmentation and color normalization in histological images, using truncated normal distribution and spatial attention for improved accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of nuclei segmentation in histological images with color variation and stain overlap, ensuring robustness and generalizability.

Method: The model integrates truncated normal distribution and spatial attention, assuming disentangled representations for color appearance and nuclei segmentation.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance on standard histological image datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles color variation and stain overlap, improving nuclei segmentation and color normalization simultaneously.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Result: VGG16 achieved 99.17% accuracy, with XAI improving interpretability by highlighting critical MRI regions.

Conclusion: Deep learning combined with XAI can enhance brain tumor detection in resource-limited areas, offering a viable solution for timely diagnosis.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and
uncontrolled proliferation, resulting in malignancy. Timely identification is
crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in nations such as
Bangladesh, where healthcare infrastructure is constrained. Manual MRI analysis
is arduous and susceptible to inaccuracies, rendering it inefficient for prompt
diagnosis. This research sought to tackle these problems by creating an
automated brain tumor classification system utilizing MRI data obtained from
many hospitals in Bangladesh. Advanced deep learning models, including VGG16,
VGG19, and ResNet50, were utilized to classify glioma, meningioma, and various
brain cancers. Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, such as Grad-CAM and
Grad-CAM++, were employed to improve model interpretability by emphasizing the
critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to enhance brain tumor detection and
identification in areas with restricted access to advanced medical
technologies.

*Gaoyu Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC) to improve medical image segmentation by leveraging text prompts for better semantic understanding and cross-modal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation methods struggle with weak semantic expression due to low contrast between target and non-target regions. Text prompts can help but current methods lack effective cross-modal interaction.

Method: Introduces TMC with a multistage cross-attention module for semantic detail understanding and a multi-stage alignment loss for cross-modal consistency.

Result: TMC achieves Dice scores of 84.77%, 78.50%, and 88.73% on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData, and Breast datasets, outperforming UNet-based and text-guided methods.

Conclusion: TMC effectively enhances medical image segmentation by improving cross-modal interaction and semantic consistency, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel enhancements for neural B-frame coding, focusing on fine-grained motion compression and selective temporal fusion, outperforming existing methods and matching H.266/VVC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural B-frame codecs inadequately address B-frame challenges by reusing P-frame tools, leading to suboptimal performance. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained motion compression method with an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder and adaptive quantization, and a selective temporal fusion method with bi-directional fusion weights and hyperprior-based alignment.

Result: The proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and matches H.266/VVC performance under random-access configurations.

Conclusion: The enhancements in motion compression and temporal fusion significantly improve neural B-frame coding, achieving superior compression performance.

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

TL;DR: MoE-Gyro is a self-supervised framework for MEMS gyroscopes, combining over-range signal reconstruction and noise suppression, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between measurement range and noise in MEMS gyroscopes, avoiding costly hardware solutions and impractical deep-learning methods.

Method: Uses two experts: Over-Range Reconstruction Expert (ORE) and Denoise Expert (DE), with a gating module for dynamic routing. Introduces ISEBench for evaluation.

Result: Extends measurable range to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by 98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro effectively resolves the trade-off in inertial sensing and sets a new benchmark with ISEBench.

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate

In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TL modeling is crucial for the International Monitoring System, but existing methods like the parabolic equation (PE) are computationally expensive, and neural networks struggle with unfavorable conditions.

Method: An optimized convolutional neural network is developed, trained on globally simulated temperature and wind fields, to predict TLs over 4000 km ranges.

Result: The model achieves an average error of 8.6 dB across frequencies (0.1-3.2 Hz) and performs well in realistic atmospheric scenarios.

Conclusion: The optimized network significantly improves TL prediction accuracy and efficiency, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB
in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric
scenarios.

*Alice Janela Cameijo,Alexis Le Pichon,Youcef Sklab,Souhila Arib,Quentin Brissaud,Sven peter Naesholm,Constantino Listowski,Samir Aknine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A deep learning model improves infrasound transmission loss predictions by incorporating wind and temperature fields, optimizing neural network architecture, and achieving low error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate infrasound modeling is crucial for the International Monitoring System, but current methods are computationally expensive and lack key atmospheric inputs.

Method: Uses wind and temperature fields as inputs, optimizes neural network with convolutional and recurrent layers, and simulates up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance.

Result: Achieves 4 dB average error compared to simulations, provides uncertainty estimates, and performs well on untrained data (e.g., Hunga Tonga eruption).

Conclusion: The model advances real-time assessment of detection thresholds for explosive sources, enhancing compliance monitoring for the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

*Baptiste Chatelier,Vincent Corlay,Musa Furkan Keskin,Matthieu Crussière,Henk Wymeersch,Luc Le Magoarou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A machine learning-assisted localization method improves accuracy and reduces memory usage in complex radio environments by using a generative neural channel model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signal processing struggles in NLoS environments, and existing ML methods are computationally intensive.

Method: Extends fingerprinting-based localization with a model-based neural network to learn location-to-channel mapping, serving as a generative channel model.

Result: Achieves sub-wavelength accuracy in NLoS, improving accuracy by orders of magnitude and reducing memory by an order.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances localization accuracy and efficiency in challenging environments.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

*Ali Abedi,Charlene H. Chu,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study develops machine learning models to predict agitation in dementia patients using multimodal sensor data, achieving high accuracy with a light gradient boosting machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agitation in dementia patients is common and challenging to manage. Early prediction can improve care and reduce caregiver burden.

Method: The study evaluated machine learning and deep learning models on the TIHM dataset, introducing agitation-related contextual features for prediction.

Result: The best model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.9720 and AUC-PR of 0.4320, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting agitation.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate and explainable agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in place.

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance deep learning-based ECG analysis by providing diverse, annotated datasets for tasks like digitization, lead detection, and waveform segmentation.

Method: Uses the PTB-XL signal dataset to create four open-access datasets with annotations for digitization, detection (YOLO-format), and segmentation (U-Net-compatible).

Result: Four publicly available datasets and an open-source framework for generating synthetic ECG images with annotations.

Conclusion: The framework and datasets facilitate research in ECG analysis by providing accessible, annotated synthetic data.

Abstract: We introduce an open-source Python framework for generating synthetic ECG
image datasets to advance critical deep learning-based tasks in ECG analysis,
including ECG digitization, lead region and lead name detection, and
pixel-level waveform segmentation. Using the PTB-XL signal dataset, our
proposed framework produces four open-access datasets: (1) ECG images in

digitization, (2) ECG images annotated with YOLO-format bounding boxes for
detection of lead region and lead name, (3)-(4) cropped single-lead images with
segmentation masks compatible with U-Net-based models in normal and overlapping

### [754] [Heart Rate Classification in ECG Signals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06349)
*Thien Nhan Vo,Thanh Xuan Truong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study compares traditional machine learning (hand-crafted features) and deep learning (image-based CNN) for ECG heartbeat classification. LightGBM outperformed CNNs, achieving 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of hand-crafted features versus image-based deep learning for ECG heartbeat classification.

Method: Two approaches: (1) traditional ML with HRV, RR intervals, etc., trained on SVM, Random Forest, etc.; (2) deep learning with ECG images (GAF, MTF, RP) classified by CNNs (VGG, Inception).

Result: LightGBM (hand-crafted features) achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming CNNs (F1=0.85). SVM and AdaBoost performed poorly.

Conclusion: Hand-crafted features are superior for ECG classification. Future work should explore multi-lead signals and temporal dependencies.

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

TL;DR: A streamlined pipeline for olive yield estimation using remote sensing and machine learning achieved strong predictive performance in Tunisia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Olive yield varies due to climate change, and accurate estimation is complex. This study aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective method.

Method: Features from multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and elevation data were combined with field surveys. An ensemble learning framework (AutoGluon) was used for model training and validation.

Result: Landsat-8 OLI (R²=0.8635, RMSE=1.17 t/ha) and Landsat-9 OLI-2 (R²=0.8378, RMSE=1.32 t/ha) showed strong predictive performance.

Conclusion: The method is scalable, cost-effective, and accurate, with global applicability for olive yield estimation.

Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates.
However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately
estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex
challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield
estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted
features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from
Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital
elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based
field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an
automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and
evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through
stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold
cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from
both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per
ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This
study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive
yield estimation, with potential applicability across diverse agricultural
regions globally.

*Xiaoyu Sun,Yang Yang,Xunde Dong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Patient Memory Queue (PMQ)-enhanced contrastive learning model for ECG diagnosis to better exploit patient consistency and improve robustness with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled ECG data challenges robust pretrained model development, and existing contrastive learning methods inefficiently exploit patient consistency due to insufficient intra-inter patient samples.

Method: Introduces a Patient Memory Queue (PMQ) to mitigate model degeneration from insufficient samples and adds two data augmentation methods for richer positive/negative pair perspectives.

Result: Outperforms previous contrastive learning methods on three public datasets, showing greater robustness with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The PMQ-enhanced model effectively leverages patient consistency and improves ECG diagnosis performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained
model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent
advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the
potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals
inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its
rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share
commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative
pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples
provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,
these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the
insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,
we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the
Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to
mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter
patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained
model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more
perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data
ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our
method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater
robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at

Motivation: Conventional GPR interpretation methods are limited by noise sensitivity and lack of structural awareness, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Integrates shape-aware topological features from B-scan GPR images (via TDA) with YOLOv5 for spatial detection, using a Sim2Real strategy for synthetic data generation.

Result: Significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the approach's robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of TDA-enhanced learning for reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning and infrastructure management.

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection
and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited
by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a
novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities,
especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived
from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial
detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a
novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features
in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the
geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated
real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and
realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated
and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and
efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of
TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object
detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and
infrastructure management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional filters (LMS, RLS, Wiener, Kalman) are limited by assumptions of stationarity or require complex tuning, prompting the need for model-free, adaptive solutions.

Method: The framework uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a composite reward balancing SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual smoothness.

Result: Experiments show the PPO agent generalizes beyond training, achieving real-time performance and outperforming classical filters.

Conclusion: Policy-gradient reinforcement learning is viable for robust, low-latency adaptive signal filtering.

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are
gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as
wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman
are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or
exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive
filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a
composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual
smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that
our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve arrhythmia classification by leveraging multi-view ECG data and addressing noise and artifacts through uncertainty-aware fusion.

Method: Uses three modules: (1) time-series for morphological features, (2) image-space for spatiotemporal features, and (3) uncertainty-aware fusion to combine views.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in arrhythmia classification and shows better robustness to noise and artifacts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances classification accuracy and robustness by effectively fusing multi-view ECG data.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware
multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two
different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of
information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the
different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating
uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the
following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological
features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the
spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse
the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the
performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but
also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.

Motivation: To address the need for efficient near-sensor fault diagnosis in railway point machines by balancing computational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Integrates Transformers and CNNs with a Multi-scale Depthwise Separable Convolution (MDSC) module and Broadcast Self-Attention (BSA) mechanism for optimized feature extraction.

Result: Reduces parameter count and computational complexity by 50% while improving diagnostic accuracy by nearly 3%, achieving 98.86% accuracy.

Conclusion: LD-RPMNet demonstrates feasibility for near-sensor fault diagnosis in railway applications, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Near-sensor diagnosis has become increasingly prevalent in industry. This
study proposes a lightweight model named LD-RPMNet that integrates Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks, leveraging both local and global feature
extraction to optimize computational efficiency for a practical railway
application. The LD-RPMNet introduces a Multi-scale Depthwise Separable
Convolution (MDSC) module, which decomposes cross-channel convolutions into
pointwise and depthwise convolutions while employing multi-scale kernels to
enhance feature extraction. Meanwhile, a Broadcast Self-Attention (BSA)
mechanism is incorporated to simplify complex matrix multiplications and
improve computational efficiency. Experimental results based on collected sound

*Vassiliki Mancoridis,Brian Bue,Jake H. Lee,Andrew K. Thorpe,Daniel Cusworth,Alana Ayasse,Philip G. Brodrick,Riley Duren*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes machine learning methods to improve methane plume detection across airborne and spaceborne platforms, using transfer learning and CycleGAN for data alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prioritizing methane for climate action requires accurate detection across remote sensing platforms, but cross-platform alignment is a challenge.

Method: Uses transfer learning to refine airborne-trained classifiers for spaceborne data and CycleGAN for unsupervised domain alignment.

Result: CycleGAN-translated spaceborne data, combined with airborne classifiers, yields the best methane plume detection results.

Conclusion: The approach effectively aligns data from different remote sensing instruments, applicable beyond methane detection.

Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its
significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched
filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect
methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned
anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an
increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume
detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this
work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that
leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,
reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task
across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data
from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on
airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,
outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an
unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data
distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne
EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne
classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology
is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment.
Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more
broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained
from distinct remote sensing instruments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes physiological signals (ECG, EDA, RESP) to detect drowsiness, finding that different inducers cause varied responses and objective assessments are more sensitive than subjective ones. Key metrics include heart rate stability, respiratory amplitude, and tonic EDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in how physiological metrics correlate with drowsiness labels across datasets and improve privacy-preserving drowsiness detection.

Method: Analyzed ECG, EDA, and RESP signals from four datasets with different drowsiness inducers and assessment methods. Used binary logistic regression to identify key metrics.

Result: Different inducers lead to distinct physiological responses; objective assessments are more sensitive. Increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA robustly indicate drowsiness.

Conclusion: The findings improve drowsiness detection understanding and can guide future monitoring designs for better generalizability.

Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all
measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more
privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist
regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness
labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms
(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four
datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)
and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic
regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are
associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different
drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and
objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting
drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory
amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased
drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can
inform future generalizable monitoring designs.

Conclusion: The model shows promise for real-time biosignal analysis, stress prediction, and digital mental health applications.

Abstract: Decomposing Electrodermal Activity (EDA) into phasic (short-term,
stimulus-linked responses) and tonic (longer-term baseline) components is
essential for extracting meaningful emotional and physiological biomarkers.
This study presents a comparative analysis of knowledge-driven, statistical,
and deep learning-based methods for EDA signal decomposition, with a focus on
in-the-wild data collected from wearable devices. In particular, the authors
introduce the Feel Transformer, a novel Transformer-based model adapted from
the Autoformer architecture, designed to separate phasic and tonic components
without explicit supervision. The model leverages pooling and trend-removal
mechanisms to enforce physiologically meaningful decompositions. Comparative
experiments against methods such as Ledalab, cvxEDA, and conventional
detrending show that the Feel Transformer achieves a balance between feature
fidelity (SCR frequency, amplitude, and tonic slope) and robustness to noisy,
real-world data. The model demonstrates potential for real-time biosignal
analysis and future applications in stress prediction, digital mental health
interventions, and physiological forecasting.

TL;DR: IQFM is the first foundational model for raw IQ signals in wireless communications, excelling in tasks like modulation classification and AoA with minimal labeled data, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore foundational models for raw IQ data in wireless communications, addressing the gap in direct signal processing without heavy preprocessing.

Method: Uses a contrastive SSL framework with task-aware augmentations (core and task-specific) to pre-train a lightweight encoder on multi-antenna IQ data.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (e.g., 99.67% modulation classification) with minimal labeled data, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 145x, and generalizes well to new tasks.

Conclusion: IQFM demonstrates the viability of raw IQ-based foundational models for efficient, reusable multi-task learning in 6G systems.

Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless
communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such
as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational
models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This
paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless
communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification,
angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy
preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware
augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations,
such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy
forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a
contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the
lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data,
achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification,
respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised
baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per
class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves
94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a
modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs.
96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational
models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G
systems.

*Mohammad Farzanullah,Han Zhang,Akram Bin Sediq,Ali Afana,Melike Erol-Kantarci*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel framework using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM) and Multimodal Transformer (MMT) improves channel estimation in cell-free ISAC systems, outperforming traditional methods like LS and MMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates in cell-free ISAC systems, enhancing spectral efficiency and reliability.

Method: Integrates CDDM with MMT to leverage sensing information, refining channel estimates iteratively by capturing inter-modal relationships.

Result: Achieves 8 dB and 9 dB NMSE improvements over LS and MMSE, respectively, and 27.8% over TDDM, with robustness in low SNR and pilot contamination scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances channel estimation in ISAC systems, particularly benefiting users near sensing targets.

Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize
6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC
capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and
communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free
ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually
limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates.
This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key
input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework,
we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel
estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively
captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling
the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a
27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model
(TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally,
the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains
high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users
near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and
communication channels.

*Yang Wang,Yin Xu,Cixiao Zhang,Zhiyong Chen,Xiaowu Ou,Mingzeng Dai,Meixia Tao,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model (DM) framework for RIS-assisted channel estimation, using deterministic sampling and a lightweight U-Net to improve accuracy and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the randomness in conventional DM approaches and enhance channel estimation accuracy across varying SNRs.

Method: Reformulates channel estimation as a denoising process, employs deterministic sampling with step alignment, and designs a lightweight U-Net.

Result: Superior performance across SNRs, e.g., 13.5 dB NMSE improvement at 0 dB SNR; lightweight U-Net retains performance with 6.59% of original parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, practical, and outperforms baselines, especially in low SNR scenarios.

Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM)
framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising
process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the
inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we
adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that
ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of
the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves
comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed
method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide
range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves
performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error
(NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost
no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\%
of its parameters.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A framework using conditional diffusion models for inverse design of metamaterials, improving spectral prediction and fabrication feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in machine learning for metamaterial design due to nonlinear structure-behavior relationships and fabrication difficulties.

Method: Proposes a general framework with spectrum-to-shape and size parameters using conditional diffusion models.

Result: Superior spectral accuracy, diverse pattern generation, and useful prior knowledge for fabrication. Demonstrated with a thermal camouflage metamaterial.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses one-to-many inverse design problems and aids experimental fabrication.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that manipulate
electromagnetic waves, having optical properties absent in natural materials.
Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn
attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial
structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses
challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex
metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements
customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many
metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our
method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse
range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers
valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of
the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental
fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form
metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage
applications.

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Guancheng Wan,Miao Yu,Kun Wang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: G-Memory is a hierarchical memory system for multi-agent systems (MAS) that improves collaboration by leveraging insights and interaction trajectories, boosting success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS memory architectures are simplistic and lack customization, hindering self-evolution and inter-agent collaboration.

Method: Introduces G-Memory, a three-tier graph hierarchy (insight, query, interaction graphs) for bi-directional memory traversal and evolution.

Result: Improves success rates by up to 20.89% in embodied action and 10.12% in knowledge QA across benchmarks.

Conclusion: G-Memory enhances MAS performance without framework modifications, enabling progressive evolution of agent teams.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of finding compromise proposals in coalition formation by formalizing a model with bounded rationality and uncertainty, using NLP and large language models to suggest supported compromises in collaborative document writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to identify majority-supported compromise proposals in coalition formation, especially in democratic text editing like constitution drafting, where traditional tools fall short.

Method: Formalizes a model incorporating bounded rationality and uncertainty, uses NLP and large language models to create a semantic metric space, and designs algorithms for compromise proposals.

Result: AI methods effectively generate compromise proposals, facilitating large-scale democratic text editing as demonstrated in simulations.

Conclusion: AI can bridge the gap in finding compromise proposals, enhancing collaborative document writing and democratic processes.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental
to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on
this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition
formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo,
using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in
this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent
coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains
an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates
agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to
generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document
writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our
approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models
to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design
algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To
evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that
AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where
traditional tools are limited.

TL;DR: MedChat is a multi-agent framework combining specialized vision models and role-specific LLM agents to improve glaucoma detection and reporting, addressing limitations like hallucinations and lack of domain knowledge in general LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in applying general LLMs to medical imaging, such as hallucinations and limited interpretability, and to emulate multidisciplinary medical reasoning.

Method: Proposes MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework with specialized vision models and role-specific LLM agents coordinated by a director agent.

Result: Enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting for clinical and educational use.

Conclusion: MedChat offers a robust solution for integrating deep learning and LLMs in medical imaging, improving accuracy and efficiency in glaucoma detection and reporting.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIET, a framework for improving LLM-based multi-agent planning by combining individual learning and team evolution for better adaptation and cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based planning algorithms lack strong adaptation in multi-agent embodied scenarios, despite LLMs' knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes LIET: individual agents learn local utility functions, while teams maintain shared cooperation knowledge for better communication and planning.

Result: LIET outperforms baselines in benchmarks like Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport, showing strong cooperative planning.

Conclusion: LIET enhances LLM agents' adaptability and cooperation in multi-agent embodied environments, validated by superior performance in benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong
reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent
planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities
and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based
planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to
multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a
framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during
test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better
planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by
centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)}
paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents
learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend
the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support
informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and
iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on
new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining
individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and
flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative
Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate
that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing
baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.

TL;DR: Shapley-Coop, a cooperative workflow for LLM agents, uses Shapley Chain-of-Thought and negotiation protocols to align incentives and ensure fair credit assignment in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coordination and fair credit assignment among LLM agents in open-ended environments where self-interest dominates.

Method: Proposes Shapley-Coop, integrating Shapley Chain-of-Thought (for pricing based on marginal contributions) and structured negotiation protocols for task-time pricing and reward redistribution.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced collaboration and equitable credit assignment in multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation.

Conclusion: Shapley-Coop effectively aligns agent incentives, fosters cooperation, and ensures fair compensation, proving its utility in complex human-AI collaborations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in
multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended
environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested
ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment
-- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms
that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs
increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair
compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired
by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through
temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a
cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley
Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for
pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,
enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and
post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters
cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two
multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it
consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit
assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing
mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task
execution.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper shows that avoiding diffusion of responsibility in collective decision-making requires a 'dictator' or 'elected dictatorship' mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the undesirable diffusion of responsibility in multi-agent decision-making.

Method: Defines a bisimulation of decision-making mechanisms, proves preservation of responsibility-related properties, and analyzes smallest bisimular mechanisms.

Result: With two agents, only a unilateral 'dictator' avoids diffusion; with more agents, an 'elected dictatorship' is required.

Conclusion: Diffusion-free collective decision-making necessitates centralized authority, either as a dictator or elected dictator.

Abstract: The term "diffusion of responsibility'' refers to situations in which
multiple agents share responsibility for an outcome, obscuring individual
accountability. This paper examines this frequently undesirable phenomenon in
the context of collective decision-making mechanisms.
  The work shows that if a decision is made by two agents, then the only way to
avoid diffusion of responsibility is for one agent to act as a "dictator'',
making the decision unilaterally. In scenarios with more than two agents, any
diffusion-free mechanism is an "elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a
single agent to make a unilateral decision.
  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of
decision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves
responsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest
bisimular mechanism.

TL;DR: A two-stage method for predicting 3D ligand conformations in protein binding sites using template-guided alignment and optimization, outperforming standard tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D conformation prediction of small molecules in protein binding sites is crucial for drug design, especially when template ligands are available.

Method: 1) Molecular alignment via flow-matching to generate initial 3D coordinates using a template. 2) Differentiable pose optimization refining the conformation based on shape, pharmacophore, energy, and optional protein context.

Result: Outperforms standard docking and alignment methods, particularly for low-similarity templates or flexible ligands.

Conclusion: The method improves ligand conformation prediction, offering a robust solution for drug design challenges.

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding
sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand
(template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose
prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation
guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular
alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the
ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a
differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on
shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the
protein binding pocket. We evaluate our approach on a new benchmark of ligand
pairs co-crystallized with the same target and show that it outperforms
standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases
involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein function prediction is challenging due to the vast number of functional categories and imbalanced data distribution.

Method: Leverages DPO for preference-aligned training to integrate biological knowledge.

Result: Proposes a new paradigm for protein representation learning.

Conclusion: AnnoDPO enhances protein function prediction by aligning training objectives with biological knowledge.

Abstract: Deciphering protein function remains a fundamental challenge in protein
representation learning. The task presents significant difficulties for protein
language models (PLMs) due to the sheer volume of functional annotation
categories and the highly imbalanced distribution of annotated instances across
biological ontologies. Inspired by the remarkable success of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) in large language model (LLM) alignment, we
propose AnnoDPO, a novel multi-modal framework for protein function prediction
that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance annotation
learning. Our methodology addresses the dual challenges of annotation scarcity
and category imbalance through preference-aligned training objectives,
establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein

Method: Review of GNN methodologies, including geometric GNNs, interpretable models, and scalable architectures, alongside integration with other deep learning techniques.

Result: GNNs excel in tasks like molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and synthesis planning, but bottlenecks exist in practical implementation.

Conclusion: Future work should address challenges in applying GNNs to real-world drug discovery, leveraging advances in deep learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), as topology/structure-aware models within deep

directly operating on molecular graphs, GNNs offer an intuitive and expressive
framework for learning the complex topological and geometric features of
drug-like molecules, cementing their role in modern molecular modeling. This
review provides a comprehensive overview of the methodological foundations and
representative applications of GNNs in drug discovery, spanning tasks such as
molecular property prediction, virtual screening, molecular generation,

Result: A unified framework is introduced to clarify concepts and support cumulative advancements in hydrological modeling.

Conclusion: The paper highlights limitations and future opportunities for SciML in hydrology, guiding systematic research.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to
integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant
potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple
methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine
learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and
data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation
of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without
conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of
methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful
advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework.
This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these
limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML
family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent
structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in
hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future
opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology,
where these methods remain underutilized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI agents with real-world impact necessitates clarity in ensuring their safety and adherence to normative expectations, as current interdisciplinary efforts lack clear boundaries.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy for AI alignment, categorizing it by aim (e.g., safety, ethics), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective).

Result: The framework reveals multiple valid alignment configurations, aiding practical and philosophical integration across fields.

Conclusion: This structured approach clarifies what it means for AI agents to be aligned, providing a foundation for future research and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial
agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly
controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that
they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent
interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI
Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the
conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague,
leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework
for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals,
we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality,
legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual
vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment
configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical
integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to
be aligned all-things-considered.

Motivation: The rise of AI swarms for disinformation poses severe risks to democratic processes, necessitating urgent countermeasures.

Method: Proposes platform-side defenses, model-side safeguards, and system-level oversight to mitigate AI swarm threats.

Result: Identifies risks like fabricated consensus and institutional trust erosion, advocating for proactive measures.

Conclusion: Urges a coordinated global response to safeguard democracy from AI-driven disinformation.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;

*Liangliang Chen,Zhihao Qin,Yiming Guo,Jacqueline Rohde,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama 3 70B) for assessing circuit analysis homework, showing GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B outperform GPT-3.5 Turbo. It highlights limitations and proposes future work for reliable LLM-based tutoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' potential in engineering education, specifically for automating homework assessment in circuit analysis, ensuring reliability and avoiding misleading students.

Method: Developed a dataset of LaTeX-formatted solutions, designed a prompt template to evaluate five metrics (completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, units), and tested LLMs on this dataset.

Result: GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B outperformed GPT-3.5 Turbo across all metrics, with each excelling in different aspects. Limitations of current LLMs in circuit analysis were identified.

Conclusion: The study provides benchmarks for LLM-based homework assessment and insights for developing reliable tutoring tools, with potential applications in broader engineering education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various
fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to
their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates
how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark
the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama
3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis
course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference
solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit
analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current
state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX
format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics
of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and
units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly
better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B
each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally,
we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of
circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in
LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results
establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a
reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future
work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a
broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

### [782] [From Rogue to Safe AI: The Role of Explicit Refusals in Aligning LLMs with International Humanitarian Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06391)
*John Mavi,Diana Teodora Găitan,Sergio Coronado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study evaluates eight LLMs on their compliance with IHL, focusing on refusal clarity and helpfulness. Most models rejected unlawful requests, but response quality varied. Standardized safety prompts improved explanations, though vulnerabilities remained for complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM alignment with IHL and improve transparency and safety in AI systems by evaluating their refusal mechanisms for unlawful requests.

Method: Evaluated eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts violating IHL, analyzing refusal clarity and helpfulness. Tested the impact of a standardized safety prompt.

Result: Most models rejected unlawful requests, but response clarity varied. Standardized prompts improved explanations, though complex prompts still posed challenges.

Conclusion: Standardized interventions enhance LLM compliance with IHL, but further work is needed for complex scenarios. The study proposes a benchmark for evaluating LLM safety and transparency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to simulate earthquake impacts, achieving high accuracy with multimodal data and techniques like RAG and ICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters like earthquakes by leveraging LLMs for efficient simulation.

Method: Uses multimodal datasets (geospatial, socioeconomic, building, street-level imagery) and LLMs to predict Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) at zip code and county scales. Evaluated on 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS DYFI reports.

Result: High correlation (0.88) and low RMSE (0.77) with real reports at zip code level. Visual inputs improve accuracy over numerical data alone.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for simulating disaster impacts, aiding pre-event planning.

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

### [784] [Large Language Models Can Be a Viable Substitute for Expert Political Surveys When a Shock Disrupts Traditional Measurement Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06540)
*Patrick Y. Wu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) as substitutes for expert political surveys post-shock, demonstrating this with the 2025 DOGE layoffs case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert judgments post-shock are biased by outcome knowledge, hindering pre-event perception reconstruction.

Method: LLMs were used with pairwise comparison prompts to derive ideology scores and predict targeted agencies.

Result: LLM-derived scores replicated pre-layoff expert measures and predicted targeted agencies, including perceptions of agencies as knowledge institutions.

Conclusion: LLMs offer rapid, viable substitutes for expert surveys post-shock, with a proposed criterion for their use.

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auditing framework to assess worker preferences for AI automation/augmentation, aligning them with technological capabilities, and reveals mismatches and opportunities in AI agent development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic understanding of how AI agents impact the labor market, particularly regarding job displacement and human agency.

Method: Develops an audio-enhanced mini-interview framework and the Human Agency Scale (HAS) to quantify worker preferences, creating the WORKBank database with input from 1,500 workers and AI experts.

Result: Identifies four task zones (Automation Green/Red Light, R&D Opportunity, Low Priority) and diverse HAS profiles, highlighting shifts in core human competencies.

Conclusion: Emphasizes aligning AI development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Minds (GenMinds) and RECAP framework to enhance LLM-based agents for social simulations by ensuring structured, revisable, and traceable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for simulating human reasoning and behavior.

Method: Proposes GenMinds, a cognitive science-inspired paradigm for structured belief representations, and RECAP, a benchmark to evaluate reasoning fidelity.

Result: GenMinds and RECAP aim to improve LLM agents' reasoning fidelity, causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency.

Conclusion: The work shifts focus from surface-level mimicry to simulating thought in generative agents for more reliable social simulations.

Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more
than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning
that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly
used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting
and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal
reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how
people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds
(GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief
representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the
RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess
reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and
intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from
surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just
language -- for social simulations.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs can assess variable choice coherence well (F1 score 0.87 for GPT-4o) but struggle with deeper aspects like coefficient plausibility and publication suitability, highlighting their assistive but limited role in peer review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to assess economic soundness and theoretical consistency in spatial econometrics research.

Method: Created original and altered summaries from 28 papers (2005-2024), evaluated by diverse LLMs for qualitative and binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and publication suitability.

Result: LLMs excel in variable choice coherence but vary in deeper assessments; performance depends on LLM choice, paper characteristics, and their interaction.

Conclusion: LLMs are useful for surface-level checks but require human oversight for nuanced judgments, suggesting an assistive role in peer review.

Abstract: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the
economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial
econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual"
summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a
diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured
binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and
publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly
assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving
an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when
evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall
publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM,
the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two
factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly
for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in
assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in
performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential
assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.

Result: Deepfakes can be easily created, posing significant risks like fraud and misinformation.

Conclusion: Urgent regulatory frameworks, public awareness, and collaboration are needed to combat deepfake threats.

Abstract: Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on
Digital Trust. With the increasing accessibility of generative AI, tools for
voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced
significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use.
While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth
raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores
the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud,
misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using
cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we
explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources,
demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By
analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and
detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public
awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.

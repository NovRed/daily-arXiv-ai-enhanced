<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' ability to understand, identify mistakes, and grade student math solutions, unlike existing benchmarks focused on problem-solving.

Method: Compiled 122 scanned solutions from the Russian EGE with expert grades, tested seven VLMs in three inference modes.

criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The

### [2] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for fast reconstruction and real-time rendering of urban scenes, optimizing training efficiency and handling appearance variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in urban-scale scene reconstruction, such as appearance inconsistencies and computational efficiency.

Method: Uses scene partitioning, visibility-based image selection, controllable LOD, appearance transformation, and enhancement modules like depth regularization.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in efficiency and quality for urban-scale scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances speed, robustness, and visual fidelity for large-scale scenes.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff combines diffusion models and Vision Transformers to generate diverse and realistic human gaze scanpaths, outperforming existing methods in free-viewing and task-driven scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for scanpath prediction often fail to capture the variability of human visual exploration, limiting their realism and applicability.

Method: ScanDiff leverages diffusion models and Vision Transformers to model scanpath variability and introduces textual conditioning for task-driven generation.

Result: Experiments show ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods, producing more diverse and accurate scanpaths in both free-viewing and task-driven contexts.

Conclusion: ScanDiff advances gaze prediction research by better capturing human visual behavior complexity, with publicly available source code and models.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) improves classification accuracy on low-quality echocardiograms, with SRResNet showing significant performance gains and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor-quality echocardiographic imaging in resource-constrained settings limits diagnostic model effectiveness, prompting exploration of SR techniques for enhancement.

Method: Used SRGAN and SRResNet on the CAMUS dataset to enhance low-quality 2D echocardiograms, evaluating performance on two classification tasks: 2CH vs. 4CH and ED vs. ES.

Result: SRResNet notably improved classification accuracy and was computationally efficient, demonstrating SR's potential to recover diagnostic value in degraded scans.

Conclusion: SR, especially SRResNet, is a viable tool for enhancing low-quality echocardiograms, aiding AI-assisted care in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PATA, a spike-based NeRF framework with dynamic time step training, reducing computational costs while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF models are computationally expensive, limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios. SNNs offer energy efficiency, making them a viable alternative.

Method: Proposes PATA, a spike-based NeRF framework with adaptive time step training, optimizing rendering quality and time step length.

Result: PATA reduces inference time steps by 64% and running power by 61.55% while preserving rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: PATA effectively balances rendering quality and computational efficiency, making NeRF models more practical for resourceconstrained environments.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive is a vision-language architecture for autonomous vehicles, combining front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints. It uses cross-attention and a smoothness loss for real-time inference, improving success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need fast, accurate navigation in complex environments. Current methods often rely on recurrent memory, which can be inefficient. NovaDrive aims to simplify this with a single-branch architecture.

Method: NovaDrive processes multiple inputs (images, maps, LiDAR, waypoints) in one branch using cross-attention. It fine-tunes a vision-language backbone (LLaMA-3.2) and employs a smoothness loss to avoid abrupt changes.

Result: On benchmarks, NovaDrive improves success rate (84%, +4%), path efficiency (SPL 0.66, +0.11), and reduces collisions (1.2%, -1.4%). Key contributors are waypoint tokens, partial fine-tuning, and cross-attention fusion.

Conclusion: NovaDrive offers safer, more efficient autonomous driving with shorter routes and lower energy use. Its design is adaptable to other embodied-AI domains.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MObI and AnydoorMed, two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical imaging, using diffusion models for realistic and controllable inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for realistic and controllable synthetic data in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging due to the challenges of gathering real-world data.

Method: MObI uses a diffusion model for multimodal object inpainting with 3D bounding box conditioning, while AnydoorMed applies a similar approach for medical image inpainting, focusing on anomaly preservation.

Result: Both methods achieve high realism and controllability, enabling seamless object insertion in multimodal scenes and detailed anomaly inpainting in medical images.

Conclusion: Foundation models for reference-guided inpainting can be adapted across diverse modalities, advancing the development of realistic and controllable synthetic data systems.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive is a vision-language model for autonomous driving that fuses vision, map, and waypoint inputs using goal-centered cross-attention, achieving high success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous cars require both geometric accuracy and semantic understanding, but existing systems often handle these separately. XYZ-Drive aims to unify these aspects for better performance.

Method: The model uses a lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer to fuse front-camera frames, overhead maps, and waypoints, feeding into a fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.

Result: XYZ-Drive achieves 95% success and 0.80 SPL on the MD-NEX benchmark, outperforming PhysNav-DG by 15% and reducing collisions. Ablations confirm the importance of each modality and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Early token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, and real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-FineR is a training-free method for fine-grained image classification, leveraging LLMs and VLMs for open-set recognition without predefined labels, achieving SOTA results and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for fine-grained classification rely on fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, limiting scalability and adaptability to novel classes.

Method: Proposes E-FineR, a training-free approach combining LLMs and VLMs, avoiding reliance on guessed class names and refining analysis for better performance.

Result: E-FineR achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained recognition, excels in zero-shot and few-shot classification, and offers interpretability.

Conclusion: E-FineR enables flexible, language-driven image classification, scalable for real-world applications with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) combines complementary concepts, refining them to address challenges. It uses 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation and Alpha-CLIP for classification, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OV-3DIS methods use vision-language models (VLMs) but lack integration of complementary concepts. This paper aims to combine and refine these concepts for better performance.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) 3D proposal generation via tracking-based aggregation and iterative merging/removal, and (2) instance classification using Alpha-CLIP (with object masks) and a standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score for filtering.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS, surpassing even closed-vocabulary methods in AP and AR metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates and refines existing concepts, demonstrating superior performance in OV-3DIS tasks.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo is a zero-shot diffusion-based pipeline for portrait animation, addressing identity leakage and expression capture issues with an end-to-end training framework and 1D latent motion descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches suffer from identity leakage and struggle with subtle/extreme expressions. X-NeMo aims to overcome these by introducing a novel motion descriptor and training framework.

Method: Uses a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor, cross-attention for motion control, and a dual GAN decoder with spatial/color augmentations for disentanglement.

Result: X-NeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing expressive animations with better identity preservation.

Conclusion: X-NeMo effectively mitigates identity leakage and captures detailed facial motion, offering a robust solution for portrait animation.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural inverse rendering method jointly reconstructs geometry, reflectance, and lighting from multi-view images without light calibration or intermediate cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require light calibration or intermediate steps like normal maps, limiting flexibility and accuracy.

Method: Uses neural implicit fields for geometry and reflectance, with shadow-aware volume rendering and spatial/reflectance networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in shape/lighting accuracy, handles view-unaligned images, and complex objects.

Conclusion: The method is robust, accurate, and generalizable for inverse rendering tasks.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image restoration network for rain streak removal uses Corner Loss and R-CBAM to preserve details and improve performance, outperforming previous methods on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image rain streak removal requires preserving structural details and visual quality, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: Introduces Corner Loss to protect boundaries and textures, and R-CBAM to dynamically adjust feature importance in spatial and channel dimensions.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 33.29 dB on Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively removes rain streaks while preserving image details, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

TL;DR: A framework aligns text, audio, video, and motion in a fine-grained joint embedding space for motion retrieval, improving performance and user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval methods lack intuitive interaction and sequential representation, limiting performance and user experience.

Method: Sequence-level contrastive learning aligns four modalities (text, audio, video, motion) in a joint embedding space.

Result: Achieves 10.16% improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion and 25.43% in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: Multi-modal motion retrieval, especially with audio, enhances performance and user immersion, advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

*Youngsun Jang,Dongyoun Kim,Chulwoo Pack,Kwanghee Won*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset for segmenting flooded areas in satellite images is introduced, addressing a gap in existing benchmarks. It includes 2019 Midwestern USA flood imagery, tested with state-of-the-art models, showing modest results and highlighting future research needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for flood segmentation in satellite imagery are insufficient. This study aims to fill this gap by creating a dedicated dataset.

Method: Collected 10 satellite images per location from five states, ensuring uniform resolution. Tested semantic segmentation models and conducted an ablation study on window sizes.

Result: Models showed modest performance, indicating a need for improved multimodal and temporal learning approaches.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly available, and future work should focus on advanced learning strategies for better flood segmentation.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

### [17] [Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202)
*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) method to generate adversarial images that deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without distorting clean images, using full-spectrum noise for robustness against defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create adversarial attacks on MLLMs that remain effective under defenses like low-pass filtering, avoiding high-frequency perturbations.

Method: AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of reverse diffusion, leveraging full-spectrum noise for robustness.

Result: AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack efficacy and robustness against defenses.

Conclusion: AGD is a robust and effective approach for adversarial attacks on MLLMs, resistant to common defenses.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method combining supervised baseline and instance classification models improves agglomeration detection in food crystals, enhancing accuracy and size distribution predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is challenging due to water transparency and limited perspective.

Method: Proposes a supervised baseline for pseudo-labels and an instance classification model for segmentation. Includes post-processing to preserve crystal properties.

Result: Improves true positive agglomeration classification and size distribution predictions, validated under two confidence levels.

Conclusion: The method effectively classifies agglomerated instances despite annotation variability.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

### [19] [YOLO-ROC: A High-Precision and Ultra-Lightweight Model for Real-Time Road Damage Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23225)
*Zicheng Lin,Weichao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes YOLO-ROC, a lightweight and high-precision model for road damage detection, addressing multi-scale feature extraction and computational efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with multi-scale feature extraction for diverse road damage (e.g., cracks, potholes) and high computational demands, limiting real-time deployment.

Method: YOLO-ROC introduces a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module for better multi-scale feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce complexity.

Result: YOLO-ROC achieves 67.6% mAP50, outperforming YOLOv8n by 2.11%, with a 16.8% improvement in small-target detection. It reduces parameters to 0.89M and GFLOPs to 2.6, with a model size of 2.0 MB.

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating strong performance and generalization for road damage detection.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Result: Proposed future directions: automated quality assessment, multimodal attack detection, and VLM adaptation for AR devices.

Conclusion: Aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned framework for AR safety, seeking feedback on perceptual modeling and lightweight model adaptation.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

*Fan Lyu,Linglan Zhao,Chengyan Liu,Yinying Mei,Zhang Zhang,Jian Zhang,Fuyuan Hu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL), expanding unlabeled data to include base and novel classes, and proposes ALDC to address distribution bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL methods assume unlabeled data is limited to novel classes, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to align with real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) to dynamically correct feature distributions using base samples.

Result: ALDC outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL and ALDC effectively address the challenge of biased feature distributions in few-shot learning, improving performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Sungguk Cha,DongWook Kim,Taeseung Hahn,Mintae Kim,Youngsub Han,Byoung-Ki Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-QR is a reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting in RAG systems, improving retrieval performance without human-annotated data. It shows gains for multi-modal and lexical retrievers but struggles with semantic and hybrid ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents in RAG systems is challenging, and existing methods often require human-annotated datasets.

Method: RL-QR uses reinforcement learning (GRPO) to train query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, leveraging synthesized scenario-question pairs.

Result: RL-QR improves NDCG@3 by 11% for multi-modal and 9% for lexical retrievers but fails to enhance semantic/hybrid retrievers due to training misalignments.

Conclusion: RL-QR offers a scalable, annotation-free solution for query optimization in RAG systems, though further refinement is needed for semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents the first comprehensive diffusion tractography atlas for automated mapping of cranial nerve (CN) pathways in the human brain, using multi-stage fiber clustering on data from 50 subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping CN pathways is challenging due to their unique anatomical structures and the complexity of the skull base environment. This work aims to provide a detailed and automated solution.

Method: The atlas is generated using multi-stage fiber clustering on streamlines from multi-parametric fiber tractography, analyzing ~1,000,000 streamlines from 50 HCP subjects.

Result: The atlas achieves high spatial correspondence with expert annotations across multiple datasets, identifying 8 fiber bundles for 5 CN pairs.

Conclusion: The atlas enhances automated CN pathway mapping, improving analysis and visualization of brain structures.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like occlusions, distractors, and appearance variations in object tracking by analyzing diverse tracking paradigms.

Method: Qualitative and quantitative comparison of core design principles, innovations, and limitations across three tracking categories.

Result: Novel categorization, unified visual/tabular comparison, and organization of trackers from multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: Transformer-based methods show rapid progress due to strong spatio-temporal modeling, with benchmarks highlighting their advancements.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGSI and SATL for evaluating and improving the geometric structure of time series data, outperforming traditional metrics like MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like MSE fail to capture the geometric structure of time series, which is crucial for understanding temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes TGSI for evaluation and SATL, a multi-component loss function (first-order difference, frequency domain, and perceptual feature losses) for training.

Result: Models trained with SATL outperform baselines in both MSE and TGSI metrics without extra inference cost.

Conclusion: SATL effectively enhances structure modeling in time series forecasting, validated by improved performance.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATL, a method for multi-label image recognition with partial labels, dynamically learning category-specific thresholds to improve pseudo-label accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for MLR-PL use fixed thresholds, ignoring varying score distributions across categories, leading to inaccurate pseudo-labels and poor performance.

Method: Proposes SATL, which calculates and updates category-specific thresholds dynamically using score distributions of positive/negative samples and employs differential ranking loss to enhance discrimination.

Result: Experiments on COCO and VG-200 show SATL significantly outperforms traditional methods in limited-label scenarios.

Conclusion: SATL effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-threshold approaches, improving accuracy and performance in multi-label recognition with partial labels.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

TL;DR: PixelNerd (PixNerd) is a single-stage, end-to-end solution using neural field for patch-wise decoding, avoiding VAE-related errors and complex pipelines, achieving strong FID scores on ImageNet and competitive benchmarks in text-to-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers rely on VAE-compressed latent space, causing accumulated errors and artifacts. PixelNerd aims to simplify the process by directly modeling patch-wise decoding in pixel space.

Method: Proposes PixelNerd, a neural field-based approach for patch-wise decoding, eliminating the need for VAE or cascade pipelines.

Result: Achieves 2.15 FID on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.84 FID on 512x512, with competitive scores in text-to-image benchmarks (0.73 on GenEval, 80.9 on DPG).

Conclusion: PixelNerd offers an efficient, single-stage alternative to VAE-based diffusion transformers, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2, a zero-shot model, is adapted for low-cost 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI using minimal input (single bounding box) and achieves strong performance with center-outward propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D breast MRI interpretation is labor-intensive and subjective, while commercial AI tools are costly and inaccessible in low-resource settings.

Method: SAM2 is used with a single bounding box annotation on one slice, propagated across the 3D volume using three strategies (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, center-outward).

Result: Center-outward propagation yields the most accurate segmentations, with SAM2 performing well despite no training on volumetric medical data.

Conclusion: General-purpose models like SAM2 can enable affordable, minimal-supervision 3D medical image analysis, especially in resource-limited areas.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM introduces an iterative refinement model for scalable and efficient 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, outperforming existing methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods for 3D reconstruction face scalability issues due to high computational costs from full attention across multiple input views.

Method: iLRM employs an iterative refinement mechanism with decoupled scene representation, a two-stage attention scheme, and high-resolution information injection.

Result: iLRM achieves superior reconstruction quality and speed on datasets like RE10K and DL3DV, with better scalability for more input views.

Conclusion: iLRM presents a scalable and efficient solution for high-quality 3D reconstruction, addressing computational limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation, and editing with a unified tokenizer, maintaining comprehension while improving performance in generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous CLIP-based methods, which require additional decoders or quantization, leading to inconsistent performance.

Method: Introduces a two-stage training scheme, self-distillation, and a dual-condition architecture connecting MLLM and diffusion transformer.

Result: Achieves superior scores on GenEval (0.87), WISE (0.53), and ImgEdit Benchmark (3.62), outperforming similar models.

Conclusion: UniLIP expands CLIP's applications, excelling in both understanding and generative tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLiM, a novel retrieval framework using MLLMs, addresses candidate prior bias in text-video retrieval by leveraging bidirectional likelihood estimation and CPN, outperforming SOTA models by 6.4 R@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive MLLM use in retrieval introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with higher priors over relevance.

Method: Proposes BLiM (bidirectional likelihood estimation) and CPN (Candidate Prior Normalization) to mitigate bias and improve relevance.

Result: BLiM with CPN outperforms SOTA by 6.4 R@1 on benchmarks, reducing bias and enhancing relevance.

Conclusion: BLiM and CPN effectively address prior bias in retrieval and show broader applicability in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark to evaluate structural robustness in document layout predictions, addressing limitations of traditional metrics like IoU and mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics (IoU, mAP) fail to detect critical structural errors in document layout analysis, necessitating a more robust evaluation framework.

Method: Proposes LED with eight standardized error types and three tasks: error existence detection, type classification, and element-wise classification. Uses LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset with injected structural errors.

Result: LED effectively differentiates structural understanding in models, revealing biases and trade-offs not captured by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LED provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating structural robustness in document layout analysis, addressing gaps in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Hanshen Zhu,Zhen Zhu,Kaile Zhang,Yiming Gong,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled pipeline for geometric image editing outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and precision, especially for complex transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with large or complex geometric transformations, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes a decoupled pipeline separating object transformation, source inpainting, and target refinement using FreeFine, a training-free diffusion method.

Result: FreeFine excels in image fidelity and edit precision on the GeoBench benchmark, particularly for demanding transformations.

Conclusion: The decoupled pipeline with FreeFine offers superior performance in geometric image editing, validated by the GeoBench benchmark.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a concise, annotation-efficient framework for semi-supervised camouflaged object detection, using self-training and hybrid prompts to outperform existing methods with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations and address prediction bias and computational overhead in existing SSCOD methods.

Method: Employs self-training with dynamic pseudo-label filtering and hybrid prompts leveraging the Segment Anything Model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% labeled data, matching fully supervised methods.

Conclusion: ST-SAM sets a new paradigm for efficient SSCOD, requiring only a single network without specific models or loss functions.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

*Xuewei Tang,Mengmeng Yang,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Le Cui,Mingshang Luo,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Diange Yang,Kun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriorFusion, a framework integrating semantic, geometric, and generative priors to improve road perception for autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need reliable road perception in complex environments without HD maps, but current methods fail to fully exploit structured priors in road elements, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: PriorFusion uses an instance-aware attention mechanism and shape-prior features, constructs a data-driven shape template space, and employs a diffusion-based framework for prediction.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements, especially in challenging conditions, with more regular and coherent predictions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively enhances road perception by leveraging structured priors, advancing autonomous driving technology.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

*Timm Hess,Gido M van de Ven,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Linear merging of models in continual learning preserves shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge, with incremental training outperforming parallel training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how model merging affects knowledge retention in continual learning, particularly focusing on shared vs. task-specific knowledge.

Method: Controlled computer vision experiments with visual cues, comparing merging models from incremental vs. parallel training.

Result: Merging preserves or enhances shared knowledge but degrades unshared task-specific knowledge; incremental training merging outperforms parallel training.

Conclusion: Incremental training is more effective for model merging in continual learning, preserving shared knowledge better.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how text-to-image diffusion models internally represent content and style in artworks, revealing varying degrees of separation influenced by prompt tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diffusion models encode content and style concepts without explicit training on this distinction.

Method: Uses cross-attention heatmaps to attribute image pixels to content or style prompt tokens, isolating their influences.

Result: Diffusion models show emergent content-style separation, with content tokens affecting object regions and style tokens influencing backgrounds/textures.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how generative models represent artistic concepts unsupervised, with tools for visualizing attention maps.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes hyperparameter impacts on lightweight CNN and transformer models for real-time image classification, identifying optimal settings for accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time image classification on resource-constrained devices by optimizing hyperparameters for lightweight models.

Method: Comparative study of seven models (e.g., EfficientNetV2-S, MobileViT) on ImageNet-1K, focusing on hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and data augmentation.

Result: Cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size enhance accuracy and speed. RepVGG-A2 achieves >80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for deploying efficient models in real-time pipelines, balancing accuracy and cost.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA is a reconstruction-based visual token pruning framework for autonomous driving, focusing on foreground information to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual token pruning methods perform poorly in autonomous driving, while human drivers focus on foreground areas. Retaining such information is crucial for decision-making.

Method: Proposes FastDriveVLA with ReconPruner, a plug-and-play pruner using MAE-style pixel reconstruction and adversarial training to prioritize foreground tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark across various pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA effectively reduces computational costs by focusing on foreground information, enhancing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FASTopoWM is a novel framework for lane segment topology reasoning in autonomous driving, improving temporal perception and reducing reliance on historical queries and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lane topology reasoning lack effective temporal information use, are vulnerable to pose estimation failures, and have insufficient temporal propagation.

Method: FASTopoWM introduces a fast-slow framework with latent world models, parallel supervision of queries, and action-conditioned latent query and BEV models for better temporal propagation.

Result: FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 37.4% mAP in lane detection and 46.3% OLS in centerline perception on OpenLane-V2.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances lane topology reasoning by addressing temporal limitations and improving performance in autonomous driving perception.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation improves robustness to domain shifts by using implicit feature perturbations and adaptive consistency constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in medical imaging degrade segmentation performance due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and protocols, limiting practical deployment.

Method: The framework introduces implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics, using a learnable semantic direction selector and covariance-based semantic intensity sampler. An adaptive consistency constraint stabilizes feature selection.

Result: Outperforms existing domain generalization approaches on multi-center benchmarks, achieving robust and generalizable segmentation across diverse clinical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses domain shifts in medical image segmentation, enhancing reliability and performance in varied clinical settings.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework for traffic sign recognition addresses long-tail distribution and small target challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic sign recognition is critical for autonomous driving but suffers from long-tail data distribution and small target issues, degrading performance.

Method: Proposes NanoVerse YOLO for detection (with RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv) and TSR-MCL for classification (using vision-language contrastive learning).

Result: Achieves 78.4% mAP on TT100K for long-tail detection, with 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles data imbalance and scale variations, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road surface reconstruction is crucial for autonomous driving but is challenged by occlusions, visual clutter, and appearance degradation due to lighting and weather changes.

Method: The method uses planar-adapted Gaussian representation, segmentation-guided video inpainting, and semantic-aware color correction in HSV space.

Result: The framework outperforms prior methods, producing visually coherent and geometrically faithful reconstructions in urban-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances road surface reconstruction under real-world conditions, addressing key challenges in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: Face detection is vital for AI applications, but low-resolution images degrade performance. This study aims to understand how resolution impacts detection accuracy and robustness.

Method: Evaluated YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN on WIDER FACE dataset across resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640) using precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time metrics.

Result: YOLOv11 performs best in accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 has higher recall, and MTCNN is slower but effective for landmark tasks.

model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

### [45] [Who is a Better Talker: Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment for AI-Generated Talking Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23343)
*Yingjie Zhou,Jiezhang Cao,Zicheng Zhang,Farong Wen,Yanwei Jiang,Jun Jia,Xiaohong Liu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces THQA-10K, the largest dataset for assessing AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) quality, evaluates 12 T2I models and 14 talkers, and proposes a SOTA objective assessment method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive studies on AGTH quality and the challenges in talker performance, the paper aims to provide a large-scale dataset and an effective assessment method.

Method: The THQA-10K dataset is created using 12 T2I models and 14 talkers, generating 10,457 AGTHs. Subjective ratings by volunteers and an objective method based on first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency are used.

Result: The dataset and proposed method expose distortions in AGTHs and evaluate talker performance. The objective method achieves SOTA performance in AGTH quality assessment.

Conclusion: The work provides a valuable resource (THQA-10K) and a robust method for AGTH quality assessment, advancing research in this emerging field.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

TL;DR: The report reviews six influential computer vision papers, covering ResNet, ViT, GANs, LDMs, DINO, and MAE, highlighting their contributions to image recognition, generation, and self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision, focusing on foundational architectures, generative models, and self-supervised techniques.

Method: Examines six influential papers, detailing their innovations like residual connections (ResNet), attention-based models (ViT), adversarial training (GANs), latent diffusion (LDMs), self-distillation (DINO), and masked autoencoding (MAE).

Result: Identifies advancements in deep learning for vision tasks, including improved training (ResNet), efficient synthesis (LDMs), and scalable pre-training (MAE).

Conclusion: The reviewed works represent significant milestones in computer vision, driving progress in recognition, generation, and unsupervised learning.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of directly applying NLP layer pruning methods to LVLMs due to modality divergence, proposing a novel framework, Short-LVLM (SVL), to improve pruning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) face practical limitations due to their massive parameters and high computational costs, despite their strong multi-modal capabilities.

Method: The authors identify challenges in pruning LVLMs, such as non-essential vision-language tokens and inter-layer feature gaps, and propose Short-LVLM to address these issues.

Result: Short-LVLM achieves a superior performance-efficiency trade-off, is training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves LVLM pruning, offering a practical solution for reducing computational costs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: VMatcher is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for semi-dense feature matching, combining efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of Transformer-based feature matching by integrating Mamba's linear complexity with Transformer's attention.

Method: Hybrid Mamba-Transformer network with hierarchical architectures for efficient feature matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant efficiency gains, suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: VMatcher sets new benchmarks in feature matching by balancing computational efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

### [49] [UniEmo: Unifying Emotional Understanding and Generation with Learnable Expert Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23372)
*Yijie Zhu,Lingsen Zhang,Zitong Yu,Rui Shao,Tao Tan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniEmo is a unified framework integrating emotional understanding and generation, using hierarchical feature extraction and diffusion models, enhanced by feedback mechanisms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional understanding and generation are complementary but often treated separately. UniEmo aims to unify them for mutual enhancement.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with expert queries for multi-scale feature extraction, fused with a diffusion model for generation. Introduces emotional correlation coefficient and condition loss for diversity and fidelity.

Result: UniEmo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework with dual feedback mechanisms enhances both tasks, demonstrating the benefits of joint training and explicit feedback.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

*Haoran Chen,Zexiao Wang,Haidong Cao,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MP^2A, a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled tasks, mitigating noise and improving domain-invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of noisy pseudo-labels and unstable alignment in multi-source domain adaptation using CLIP.

Method: Progressively trains on high-confidence target samples first, then gradually includes harder samples to refine learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: MP^2A effectively mitigates confirmation bias and enhances domain-invariant feature learning in CLIP-based UDA.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address 3DGS's sensitivity to initialization, limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations by leveraging NeRF's continuous spatial representation.

Method: Jointly optimizes NeRF and 3DGS, aligning their spatial features and optimizing residual vectors for implicit features and Gaussian positions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating complementary strengths of NeRF and 3DGS.

Conclusion: NeRF-GS shows hybrid approaches combining NeRF and 3DGS are effective for efficient 3D scene representation.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGA framework improves medical vision-language pretraining by capturing structured semantics from paired images and reports, using adaptive grouping and alignment without external negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods oversimplify clinical reports and rely on impractical hard negatives for contrastive learning in small-scale medical datasets.

Method: AGA uses bidirectional grouping with sparse similarity matrices, adaptive threshold gating, and instance-aware alignment loss for fine-grained image-text alignment.

Result: AGA outperforms on retrieval and classification tasks in fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: AGA effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering a robust framework for medical vision-language learning.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a reconstruction-free OOD detection method using Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM) for efficient, accurate anomaly detection in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised OOD detection is needed for rare pathological cases, but current methods are computationally expensive and unreliable.

Method: Leverages forward diffusion trajectories of SBDDM, using trajectory curvature via Stein scores for anomaly scoring with minimal steps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection by up to 10.43% and 18.10%, with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: SBDDM is a practical, efficient solution for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

TL;DR: A machine learning system using hyperspectral imaging detects honey adulteration with sugar syrup, achieving 96.39% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve honey adulteration detection, replacing chemical methods.

Method: Uses LDA for feature extraction and KNN for classification in two subsystems: botanical origin and adulteration detection.

Result: 96.39% cross-validation accuracy in detecting adulteration.

Conclusion: The system is a viable alternative to chemical-based methods for honey adulteration detection.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing a dual-teacher self-supervised framework for art style classification by replacing MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving accuracy by modeling nonlinear feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Art style classification is challenging due to limited labeled data and complex stylistic elements. Existing methods struggle with global context and nonlinear feature interactions.

Method: The authors replace MLP projection and prediction heads in a dual-teacher framework with KANs, leveraging spline-based activations for precise nonlinear modeling.

Result: Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k show improved Top-1 accuracy over the base dual-teacher architecture, with better linear probe accuracy.

Conclusion: KANs effectively disentangle complex style manifolds, outperforming MLP projections in art style classification.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyCASS, a learning-based model for adjustable hyperspectral image (HSI) compression, analyzing spectral and spatial compression effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive analysis on spectral and spatial compression effects in learning-based HSI compression.

Method: Proposes HyCASS with six modules (spectral/spatial encoders/decoders, CR adapters) using convolutional layers and transformer blocks.

Result: HyCASS outperforms existing models on benchmark datasets, providing guidelines for balancing spectral and spatial compression.

Conclusion: HyCASS effectively balances compression in spectral and spatial dimensions, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage ML for accurate medical predictions, specifically using chest X-rays to diagnose ailments.

Method: Implemented baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 on 5824 chest X-ray images, analyzed performance and decision-making using gradient-weighted class activation mapping.

Result: Both models performed well in binary classification, but DenseNet-121 more accurately focused on critical image regions.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 is more effective for medical image analysis due to its superior attention to relevant features.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF) to address resolution-drift in non-classification tasks like human pose estimation, improving performance without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) has succeeded in classification tasks but struggles with non-classification tasks due to resolution variability (resolution-drift). This paper explores this underexplored issue.

Method: RAF uses heatmap-based knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from higher-resolution outputs (teachers) to lower-resolution outputs (students) to enhance resolution robustness.

Result: RAF mitigates resolution drift, improves performance, and integrates seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. It also shows generalizability to other spatial-detail tasks.

Conclusion: RAF effectively addresses resolution-drift in FL for non-classification tasks, offering a scalable solution with broader applicability beyond human pose estimation.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Motivation: Address the lack of diversity and complexity in current UAV tracking datasets to better reflect real-world scenarios.

Method: Develop CST Anti-UAV with 220 video sequences and 240k annotations, featuring tiny UAVs and complex scenes, and evaluate 20 SOT methods.

Result: State-of-the-art methods achieve only 35.92% accuracy on CST Anti-UAV, compared to 67.69% on simpler datasets.

anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

*Ting Huang,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D-R1 is a foundation model improving 3D VLMs' reasoning and generalization by using a synthetic dataset (Scene-30K), RLHF training, and dynamic view selection. It achieves a 10% average improvement on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D VLMs lack robust reasoning and generalization due to limited spatial data and static viewpoints.

Method: Constructs Scene-30K dataset, uses RLHF (GRPO) with three reward functions, and implements dynamic view selection.

Result: 10% average improvement on 3D scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: 3D-R1 effectively enhances reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

*Julia Werner,Oliver Bause,Julius Oexle,Maxime Le Floch,Franz Brinkmann,Jochen Hampe,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task neural network for video capsule endoscopy combines self-localization and anomaly detection in a single model, achieving high accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The short battery life of capsule endoscopy devices and the challenge of data sparsity and limited resources motivate the need for an efficient AI solution.

Method: Developed a multi-task neural network with restricted parameters, integrating self-localization and anomaly detection, tested on the Galar dataset with Viterbi decoding.

Result: Achieved 93.63% accuracy in localization and 87.48% in anomaly detection with only 1 million parameters, outperforming single-task models.

Conclusion: The multi-task approach significantly advances AI in capsule endoscopy, offering efficient, real-time decision-making with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Conclusion: FastPoint effectively accelerates 3D point cloud processing without compromising accuracy, enhancing efficiency in state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable-Sim2Real introduces a two-stage depth diffusion model to improve 3D data simulation, enhancing realism and performance in real-world 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between synthetic and real-captured 3D data is challenging due to the complexity of real data, requiring a data-driven approach.

Method: A two-stage depth diffusion model: first finetunes Stable-Diffusion for residual generation, then refines with a second-stage diffusion prioritizing distinct areas via a 3D discriminator.

Result: Training with simulated data from Stable-Sim2Real boosts performance in real-world 3D tasks and achieves high similarity to real-captured patterns.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real effectively improves 3D data simulation, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

*Jinshan Zhen,Yuanyue Ge,Tianxiao Zhu,Hui Zhao,Ya Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-based pipeline using RGB-D sensing and deep learning for real-time mass estimation of strawberries, addressing occlusion and pose challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mass estimation of strawberries is difficult due to occlusions and pose variations, necessitating a non-destructive, real-time solution.

Method: Combines YOLOv8-Seg for segmentation, CycleGAN for occlusion recovery, tilt-angle correction, and polynomial regression for mass mapping.

Result: Achieved mean errors of 8.11% (isolated) and 10.47% (occluded), with CycleGAN outperforming LaMa in occlusion recovery.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring despite complex occlusions.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

*Timing Li,Bing Cao,Jiahe Feng,Haifang Cao,Qinghau Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hy-CycleAlign, a hyperbolic space-based image registration method for multi-modal image fusion, outperforming Euclidean-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean-based registration methods fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, leading to poor fusion quality.

Method: Hy-CycleAlign uses a dual-path cyclic registration framework in hyperbolic space, with a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H²CA) module to reduce modality discrepancies.

Result: The method significantly improves alignment and fusion quality compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space enables more effective multi-modal image registration, with Hy-CycleAlign setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

*David A. Kelly,Akchunya Chanchal,Nathan Blake*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how minimal sufficient pixel sets reveal differences in how image classifiers (like ConvNext and EVA) focus on images, showing misclassified images require larger pixel sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different vision models make decisions is limited, despite their widespread use in image classification.

Method: Proposes using minimal sufficient pixel sets to analyze model 'concentration'—key pixels for decision-making—comparing size, position, and overlap across architectures.

Result: Different architectures (e.g., ConvNext, EVA) exhibit distinct concentration patterns; misclassified images involve larger pixel sets.

Conclusion: Minimal pixel sets provide insights into model behavior, revealing architectural differences and misclassification trends.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

*Gopika Sudhakaran,Hikaru Shindo,Patrick Schramowski,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Kristian Kersting,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework, improves VRD by instruction tuning VLMs on diverse data, outperforming baselines and generalizing to unseen relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRD models trained on limited data struggle with generalization, and prompt tuning lacks adaptability for novel relations.

Method: ART converts VRD datasets into instruction tuning format, uses adaptive sampling, and focuses on relation classification with given subject-object boxes.

Result: ART outperforms baselines, generalizes to unseen relations, and aids in segmenting complex scenes.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with ART enhances VRD performance and generalizability, offering practical applications in scene segmentation.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D object detection methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, while real-world applications require handling novel scenes and categories.

Method: The proposed 3D-MOOD lifts open-set 2D detection into 3D space using a 3D bounding box head, incorporates geometry prior for object queries, and designs a canonical image space for cross-dataset training.

Result: 3D-MOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both closed-set (Omni3D) and open-set (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet) benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses open-set challenges in monocular 3D object detection, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs) for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization, combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with implicit feature fields. It achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual localization accuracy while preserving privacy by leveraging 3D geometric information and differentiable rasterization.

Method: Proposes GSFFs, aligning 3D scale-aware feature fields with 2D encoders using contrastive learning. Uses 3D clustering for regularization and segmentation for privacy. Pose refinement aligns query images with rendered GSFFs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both privacy-preserving and non-privacy-preserving visual localization on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GSFFs provide an effective, privacy-aware solution for visual localization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the modality gap between visual and linguistic information in SLT, especially capturing hand shapes and movements.

Method: Leverages VideoLLMs, generates fine-grained hand motion descriptions, uses contrastive alignment, distills HaMeR features, and applies contrastive loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss effectively addresses SLT challenges, demonstrating the framework's success.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: MamV2XCalib is a V2X-based infrastructure camera calibration method using vehicle-side LiDAR, eliminating manual intervention and reference objects. It introduces a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method with multi-scale features and 4D correlation volume, addressing data defects and viewpoint differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual calibration is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The need for automated, scalable solutions for infrastructure camera calibration in cooperative systems drives this work.

Method: MamV2XCalib leverages vehicle-side LiDAR data, combining multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume for calibration. Temporal modeling and Mamba estimate rotation angles, handling data defects and viewpoint differences.

Result: Evaluated on V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X datasets, MamV2XCalib shows better and more stable performance than previous methods, with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib provides an effective, robust, and automated solution for infrastructure camera calibration in V2X scenarios, outperforming traditional and single-car LiDAR-camera methods.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGA reconstructs high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from single-view images using a generative avatar model and 2D diffusion models, ensuring 3D consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is inferring unseen details from a single view while maintaining 3D consistency, as previous methods using 2D diffusion models produce inconsistent results.

Method: MoGA combines a generative avatar model (sampling deformed Gaussians) with 2D diffusion models, enforcing 3D constraints and refining pose estimation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, generalizes to real-world scenarios, and produces animatable avatars.

Conclusion: MoGA effectively addresses limitations of prior work by integrating generative and diffusion models for realistic 3D avatar reconstruction.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

TL;DR: A directional pure 2D approach for 3D occupancy prediction balances accuracy and speed, achieving 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D occupancy prediction prioritize accuracy over real-time needs, limiting autonomous driving performance.

Method: Slices 3D voxel features to retain vertical geometry, uses directional attention for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 39.3% mIoU and 27.7 FPS on Occ3D-nuScenes, with 14.8 FPS on edge devices.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, suitable for real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes Vcamba with RFVSS for spatial features, AFE for frequency learning, SLMP and FLMP for motion perception, and SFMF for feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 6 metrics across 2 datasets with lower computation cost.

Conclusion: Vcamba's spatio-frequency approach enhances VCOD accuracy and efficiency, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The MIDI-B Challenge standardized benchmarking of DICOM image de-identification tools, ensuring HIPAA compliance while preserving research-critical metadata, with high success rates (97.91%-99.93%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for standardized de-identification of medical images to comply with privacy laws while preserving metadata for AI research.

Method: A three-phase challenge (training, validation, test) using synthetic PHI/PII in real de-identified radiology images, evaluated by rule-based scoring.

Result: Ten teams achieved high accuracy (97.91%-99.93%) using diverse tools like open-source software, LLMs, and OCR.

Conclusion: The challenge successfully demonstrated the feasibility of standardized de-identification, highlighting effective tools and configurations.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl is a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable image generation, improving generalization and reducing adaptation costs for novel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation either train separate models for each condition or use entangled representations, leading to poor generalization and high adaptation costs.

Method: DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into disentangled components (learngenes and tailors) and uses a dynamic gate for knowledge diversion, along with a representation alignment loss.

Result: DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4× less training cost, improves performance on basic conditions, and excels in zero-shot and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: DivControl offers superior scalability, modularity, and transferability for controllable image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA struggles with small objects and discards costly annotations in evaluation.

Method: Proposes EMAT with memory-efficient masked attention, learnable downscaling, and parameter-efficiency enhancements.

Result: Outperforms FS-CS methods on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: EMAT enhances accuracy for small objects and introduces practical evaluation settings.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SNNs is challenging due to non-differentiability and high computational demands of backpropagation, limiting deployment on edge devices.

Method: The framework treats spiking activations as black-box modules, eliminating gradient approximation, and includes a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism for dynamic loss optimization.

Result: Achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and 75.64% on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, outperforming existing FF-based SNN methods, with reduced memory and power consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an efficient, accurate, and resource-friendly solution for training SNNs, suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

TL;DR: A framework called Adaptively Distilled ControlNet improves medical image segmentation by using dual-model distillation for training and privacy-preserving generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation is limited by privacy and labeling challenges, restricting segmentation model performance.

Method: The framework uses a teacher model (conditioned on mask-image pairs) to regularize a mask-only student model via noise alignment and adaptive regularization. Only the student is used during sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19; SANet gains 2.6%/3.5% on Polyps.

Conclusion: The method is effective, superior, and enables privacy-preserving medical image generation.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses zero-shot transfer challenges in human trajectory prediction by proposing OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model with explicit temporal metadata conditioning, achieving superior performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained models struggle with zero-shot transfer to datasets with varying temporal dynamics, requiring fine-tuning and limiting scalability.

Method: The authors isolate temporal generalization issues and introduce OmniTraj, a model explicitly conditioned on temporal metadata (e.g., frame rate), pre-trained on a heterogeneous dataset.

Result: OmniTraj reduces prediction error by over 70% in zero-shot transfer scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning on four datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit temporal metadata conditioning is highly effective for zero-shot transfer, making OmniTraj a scalable and practical solution for diverse datasets.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a

TL;DR: I2V-GS introduces a novel method to synthesize autonomous driving data from infrastructure views using Gaussian Splatting, outperforming existing methods in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving data collection is costly and inefficient; synthesizing data from real-world images offers a scalable solution.

Method: Uses adaptive depth warp for dense training views, cascade inpainting for view expansion, and cross-view confidence-guided optimization.

Result: Significantly improves synthesis quality, outperforming StreetGaussian by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9% in key metrics.

Conclusion: I2V-GS is a pioneering framework for infrastructure-vehicle view transformation, enhancing autonomous driving dataset generation.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR improves 3D video reconstruction by using a velocity field and adaptive densification, addressing challenges in complex motion and scale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deformation networks overfit irregular Gaussian trajectories and struggle with dynamic content, leading to suboptimal visual quality.

Method: Proposes FlowGaussian-VR with velocity field rendering (VFR) for optical flow-based optimization and flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) for dynamic regions.

Result: Achieves over 2.5 dB PSNR gain, reduces blurry artifacts, and regularizes Gaussian trajectories.

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR enhances dynamic scene reconstruction with better visual quality and trackable motion.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve explainability in image classification by incorporating risk estimation into pixel attribution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfidence in deep learning models' predictions leads to unreliable pixel attribution, necessitating a method to enhance explainability with risk estimation.

Method: The approach iteratively applies a classification model with pixel attribution to create a volume of PA maps, generating pixel-wise distributions and an enhanced PA map with expectation values and risk estimation via coefficient of variation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on pCLE data and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances explainability by providing improved PA maps and risk estimation, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep functional maps are enhanced with data-driven methods for non-rigid shape correspondence, replacing axiomatic models with learned regularization and training for better accuracy and generality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on axiomatic models for functional map regularization, limiting accuracy and applicability. This work aims to replace these with data-driven approaches.

Method: A generative model of functional maps is trained using score-based generative modeling, then used to promote structural properties of ground truth maps. A novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain is introduced.

Result: The learned models are category-agnostic and outperform axiomatic approaches in zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Conclusion: Data-driven methods can fully replace axiomatic strategies, improving accuracy and generality in functional map applications.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

### [89] [Slot Attention with Re-Initialization and Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23755)
*Rongzhen Zhao,Yi Zhao,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIAS improves Object-Centric Learning by re-initializing redundant slots and using self-distillation for better attention maps, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in slot reuse and lack of internal supervision in existing OCL methods.

Method: Re-initializes redundant slots and uses self-distillation to refine attention maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in object discovery, recognition, and other visual tasks.

Conclusion: DIAS enhances OCL by reducing redundancy and leveraging self-distillation, offering versatile improvements.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

### [90] [SeqAffordSplat: Scene-level Sequential Affordance Reasoning on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23772)
*Di Li,Jie Feng,Jiahao Chen,Weisheng Dong,Guanbin Li,Yuhui Zheng,Mingtao Feng,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeqAffordSplat, a benchmark for sequential 3D affordance reasoning, and SeqSplatNet, an end-to-end framework using LLMs and conditional decoders to handle complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D affordance reasoning methods are limited to single-object, single-step interactions, failing to address real-world multi-object, long-horizon tasks.

Method: SeqSplatNet uses a large language model to autoregressively generate text with segmentation tokens, guiding a conditional decoder for 3D mask production. It includes pre-training (Conditional Geometric Reconstruction) and semantic feature fusion from 2D Vision Foundation Models.

Result: SeqSplatNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark, advancing affordance reasoning to sequential, scene-level tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in 3D affordance reasoning, enabling complex, sequential interactions in real-world applications.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

*Li Siyao,Yao Feng,Omid Tehari,Chen Change Loy,Michael J. Black*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 'half-physics' method embeds SMPL-X into a dynamic entity for realistic physical interactions, eliminating issues like interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics without requiring learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) lack physical interaction capabilities, leading to unrealistic dynamics and interpenetration issues.

Method: Proposes a 'half-physics' mechanism converting kinematic motion into physics simulation, maintaining kinematic control while enabling plausible interactions.

Result: Achieves real-time, learning-free physical interactions, generalizes to any body shape/motion, and preserves kinematic motion fidelity.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap between kinematic models and physical realism, offering a practical solution for dynamic interactions.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phi-Ground, a state-of-the-art GUI grounding model for Computer Use Agents (CUAs), achieving top performance on benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI grounding models for CUAs have low accuracy (<65%), hindering deployment. The study aims to improve grounding models through empirical analysis.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical study on grounding model training, from data collection to model development, resulting in the Phi-Ground model family.

Result: Phi-Ground achieves SOTA performance on five benchmarks for models under 10B parameters, with scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision.

Conclusion: The study clarifies grounding model construction and benefits perception tasks, with Phi-Ground demonstrating significant improvements.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

*Zihan Wang,Jeff Tan,Tarasha Khurana,Neehar Peri,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos, overcoming limitations of dense multi-view setups by aligning monocular reconstructions for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require expensive dense multi-view setups, which are impractical for capturing diverse real-world scenes. The goal is to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors from sparse-view cameras.

Method: Aligns independent monocular reconstructions from each camera to ensure time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods, especially in novel view rendering, as demonstrated on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view videos.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUB, a benchmark for evaluating Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) under distribution shifts, using synthetic images and a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of CBMs in identifying correct concepts under distribution shifts, particularly in critical fields like medicine.

Method: Developed SUB, a benchmark with 38,400 synthetic images from the CUB dataset, using a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method for precise image control.

Result: SUB enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs, highlighting their limitations under concept variations.

Conclusion: The benchmark and TDG method contribute to developing more robust interpretable models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for video-to-4D generation using a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE and Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model, achieving high-quality dynamic 3D content from single videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 4D diffusion modeling due to costly data construction and high-dimensional representation of 3D shape, appearance, and motion.

Method: Introduces a VAE to encode Gaussian Splats and their temporal variations, compressing animations into a latent space, and trains a diffusion model conditioned on input videos.

Result: Superior generation quality and generalization to in-the-wild videos, despite training on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Paves the way for high-quality animated 3D content generation from videos.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of formalization and consistent evaluations in post-hoc explainability for KGC hinders reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.

Result: Improved evaluation using metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@k, with a focus on meaningful interpretability for end-users.

Conclusion: Unifying methods and refining standards aims to enhance reproducibility and impact in KGC explainability research.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, particularly for transformer-based generative models, across diverse domains like climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials.

Method: Analyzes workflows in four domains, introduces a readiness framework with Data Readiness Levels and Data Processing Stages, and develops a maturity matrix for scientific data readiness.

Result: A conceptual framework that identifies common preprocessing patterns and domain-specific constraints, guiding infrastructure development for reproducible AI in science.

Conclusion: The proposed framework standardizes and improves data readiness for scalable AI training, facilitating cross-domain support in scientific research.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores balancing reasoning ability and bias mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifying a 1:4 mix of debias and reasoning samples with reinforcement learning as optimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between improving logical reasoning and reducing social biases in MLLMs, which remains an unresolved issue.

Method: Benchmarked three bias-mitigation strategies (SFT, KD, RL) and varied debias-reasoning sample proportions to analyze trade-offs.

Result: A 1:4 mix trained with RL reduces biases by 10% while retaining 88% of reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

TL;DR: AI systems perform poorly on auditory tasks humans handle easily, with a 93% failure rate in tests. The study highlights gaps in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the limitations of current AI in auditory tasks, inspired by Moravec's paradox, and to benchmark human-machine performance gaps.

Method: An auditory Turing test with 917 challenges across seven categories was used to evaluate state-of-the-art audio models like GPT-4 and Whisper.

Result: AI models failed 93% of tasks, with the best model achieving only 6.9% accuracy, compared to humans' 52%.

Conclusion: Current AI lacks mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis, necessitating new approaches integrating selective attention and context-aware perception.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'argumentative coherence' in judgmental forecasting, showing its practical value in improving accuracy for both human and LLM-based forecasters, despite users not naturally aligning with it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the properties of forecasts from an argumentative perspective and improve forecasting accuracy by ensuring reasoning coherence with predictions.

Method: Formally define argumentative coherence, evaluate its impact on human and LLM-based forecasters, and conduct user experiments to assess alignment with coherence.

Result: Filtering incoherent predictions improves accuracy for both humans and LLMs, but users generally do not align with coherence naturally.

Conclusion: Argumentation-based judgmental forecasting should integrate mechanisms to filter incoherent opinions for better group predictions.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the complexity of computing Shapley-value-based responsibility scores (WSMS) in ontology-mediated query answering, showing polynomial data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries but intractability for certain ontology languages. It identifies tractable cases for DL-Lite dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the contributions of facts to query answers using responsibility measures, particularly in ontology-mediated query answering, and understand the computational complexity of these measures.

Method: The study leverages database setting results to analyze WSMS complexity, focusing on first-order-rewritable queries and ontology languages. It explores combined complexity and identifies tractable query classes for DL-Lite dialects.

Result: WSMS computation has polynomial data complexity for first-order-rewritable queries but is intractable for ontology languages encoding reachability. Tractable cases exist for structurally restricted conjunctive queries in DL-Lite.

Conclusion: The work delineates the tractability frontier for WSMS computation, offering insights into efficient responsibility score calculation in ontology-mediated query answering.

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a divide-and-conquer approach using partial MILP calls and a novel ReLU scoring method (SAS) to reduce binary variables and improve efficiency in neural network verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for handling complex instances in neural network verification were suboptimal in selecting important ReLU variables, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduce a solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) and adapt branching functions (BaB-SR, BaB-FSB) as global scoring (GS) functions. They combine Hybrid MILP with α,β-CROWN for verification.

Result: SAS reduces binary variables by 6x while maintaining accuracy. The hybrid approach reduces undecided instances by 40% (to 8-15%) with reasonable runtime (46s-417s).

Conclusion: The proposed SAS and hybrid method significantly improve efficiency and accuracy in neural network verification, even for large models.

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

*Tosin Adewumi,Lama Alkhaled,Florent Imbert,Hui Han,Nudrat Habib,Karl Löwenmark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues against fully autonomous AI, proposing 3 levels of autonomy and emphasizing human oversight to mitigate risks, supported by theories, arguments, and evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the risks of fully autonomous AI, especially with the potential rise of artificial superintelligence (ASI), and advocate for human oversight.

Method: The paper discusses theories of autonomy, AI, and agents, presents 12 arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals, and includes evidence of AI risks.

Result: Identifies 3 levels of AI autonomy, stressing the dangers of level 3 (fully autonomous AI) and the need for human oversight.

Conclusion: Fully autonomous AI is risky; human oversight is essential to prevent misalignment and other dangers.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Result: LLM4Rail provides accurate responses and personalized recommendations, validated by the CRFD-25 dataset.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail effectively enhances railway services through LLM integration, offering tailored solutions and accurate recommendations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-Foveate is an LLM-driven method for synthesizing diverse and challenging instructions from unsupervised text, using a multi-level foveation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for instruction synthesis rely heavily on human annotation or lack diversity and difficulty.

Method: Proposes Self-Foveate, a 'Micro-Scatter-Macro' multi-level foveation method to guide LLMs in extracting fine-grained information from unsupervised text.

Result: Validated across multiple corpora and model architectures, showing effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: Self-Foveate enhances instruction synthesis diversity and difficulty, with publicly released data and code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

### [109] [Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23488)
*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal discovery in large language models (LLMs) using advanced reasoning architectures like OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R, showing significant improvements over traditional methods. A modular in-context pipeline boosts performance, highlighting the need for structured frameworks to maximize LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference is a key challenge for LLMs, and recent advances in reasoning models raise questions about their robustness in causal discovery, where traditional models often fail.

Method: The study uses the Corr2Cause benchmark with OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R models, introducing a modular in-context pipeline inspired by Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies.

Result: Reasoning-first architectures achieve significant gains, with the pipeline yielding nearly three-fold improvements over baselines. Analysis includes reasoning chain length, complexity, and qualitative comparisons.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models mark a leap forward, but structured in-context frameworks are crucial for maximizing their potential, offering a generalizable approach for causal discovery.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

### [110] [Causal Identification of Sufficient, Contrastive and Complete Feature Sets in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23497)
*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal explanations for image classifiers, combining formal rigor with practical computability, and proposes contrastive and complete causal explanations with confidence awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods for image classifiers lack formal rigor, while logic-based explanations are not computable for such models. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose causal explanations, prove their formal properties, and introduce contrastive and complete causal explanations. They implement these definitions with black-box algorithms.

Result: Experiments show varying patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness across models. The algorithms are efficient (6s per image on ResNet50) and require no model internals.

Conclusion: Causal explanations offer a rigorous yet practical solution for explaining image classifiers, with efficient and black-box computability.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [111] [DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23554)
*Ruoyu Wang,Junda Wu,Yu Xia,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DICE introduces a dynamic, theoretically grounded method for selecting in-context demonstrations to improve LLM agent performance by decomposing knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods for LLM agents are sensitive to demonstration choices, lacking a general, principled approach for effective selection across reasoning steps.

Method: DICE decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components using a causal lens, proposing a stepwise selection criterion with performance guarantees.

Result: Experiments show DICE's effectiveness and generality across domains, improving agent performance without additional training.

Conclusion: Principled, context-aware demo selection is crucial for robust and efficient LLM agents, and DICE provides a framework-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

### [112] [Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method using agentic AI and hypergraph for efficient trust evaluation in collaborative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the complexity and resource consumption of trust evaluations in distributed collaborative systems.

Method: Uses agentic AI and hypergraph to autonomously evaluate trust during device idle periods and analyze task-resource alignment.

Result: Achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation and enables efficient coordination in large-scale systems.

Conclusion: The method balances overhead and trust accuracy, improving collaborative task execution.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [113] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, MemoCue, which uses a Recall Router framework and fine-tuned LLMs to improve memory recall performance by 17.74% over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of conventional memory modules in agents by leveraging proactive memory activation through effective cues.

Method: Proposes a Recall Router framework with a 5W Recall Map for scenario classification and a hierarchical recall tree with Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategy optimization. Fine-tunes LLMs to develop MemoCue.

Result: MemoCue outperforms LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall inspiration and shows advantages in human evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances memory recall performance by integrating strategic cues and advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

*Haipeng Liu,Yuxuan Liu,Ting Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAR improves personalized question recommendation by integrating collaborative ideas into exploration, enhancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with efficient exploration in reinforcement learning for question recommendation.

Method: Proposes Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), incorporating collaborative ideas into exploration.

Result: RAR improves recommendation performance and is adaptable to RL-based recommenders.

Conclusion: RAR offers a scalable solution for efficient question recommendation.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TextQuests is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' intrinsic long-context reasoning in exploratory environments, using text-based adventures to assess self-contained problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack assessment of autonomous, sustained reasoning in exploratory environments.

Method: Introduces TextQuests, based on Infocom interactive fiction games, to evaluate LLM agents without external tools.

Result: TextQuests provides a proxy for assessing focused, stateful tasks requiring trial-and-error learning.

Conclusion: TextQuests aims to advance agents' robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Seed-Prover, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model, leverages Lean feedback and self-summarization to refine proofs, achieving high success rates on IMO and Putnam problems. Seed-Geometry addresses Lean's geometry limitations, contributing to 5/6 IMO 2025 proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with theorem proving due to unclear supervision in natural language. Formal verification via Lean provides clear signals for effective reinforcement learning.

Method: Seed-Prover iteratively refines proofs using Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. Three test-time inference strategies enable deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Geometry handles geometry tasks.

Result: Seed-Prover solves 78.1% of formalized IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and exceeds 50% on PutnamBench. Seed-Geometry outperforms prior geometry engines.

Conclusion: This work advances automated mathematical reasoning by combining formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning, demonstrated by strong performance in IMO 2025.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: CoT-Self-Instruct is a synthetic data generation method using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to create high-quality prompts for LLM training, outperforming existing datasets in verifiable reasoning and instruction-following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM training by generating high-quality synthetic data that enhances reasoning and instruction-following capabilities.

Method: Uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate synthetic prompts from seed tasks, followed by filtering with automatic metrics for quality.

Result: Outperforms existing datasets (e.g., s1k, OpenMathReasoning) in verifiable reasoning tasks (MATH500, AMC23, etc.) and surpasses human or standard self-instruct prompts in non-verifiable tasks (AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard).

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct effectively enhances LLM training by producing superior synthetic data for both reasoning and instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0
and Arena-Hard.

TL;DR: SimuRA introduces a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning using world-model-based planning to overcome autoregressive LLM limitations, achieving significant improvements in web browsing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents rely on a one-task-one-agent approach, which lacks scalability and generality. Humans, however, reason by simulating outcomes, inspiring the need for a more general AI agent.

Method: SimuRA uses a world model implemented with LLMs for planning via simulation, leveraging natural language's concept-rich latent space.

Result: SimuRA improves flight search success from 0% to 32.2%, with world-model-based planning showing up to 124% advantage over autoregressive planning.

Conclusion: SimuRA demonstrates the potential for a single, general agent model based on LLMs to act superintelligently across environments, with a web-browsing agent available for public testing.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B LLMs for improving accommodation data consistency on CALEIDOHOTELS. Mixtral 8x7B outperforms Mistral 7B in completeness, precision, and hallucination rate but at higher computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent third-party data in property booking platforms frustrates users and harms market share. The study aims to enhance data reliability using LLMs.

Method: Two LLMs (Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B) were tested for generating consistent descriptions. Mistral 7B was fine-tuned with QLoRA, while Mixtral 8x7B used a refined system prompt.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B achieved higher completeness (99.6%), precision (98.8%), and lower hallucination (1.2%) but required more resources (50GB VRAM, $1.61/hour) than Mistral 7B (5GB, $0.16/hour).

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering practical insights for deploying LLMs in production to improve accommodation data consistency.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

### [120] [ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911)
*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ElectriQ is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in electric power marketing, addressing gaps in domain expertise and empathy. It includes a dialogue dataset, evaluation metrics, and a knowledge augmentation method, showing smaller models can outperform GPT-4o when fine-tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems like China's 95598 hotline have slow response times and lack domain expertise. General LLMs like GPT-4o also lack the required domain-specific knowledge and empathy.

Method: ElectriQ introduces a dialogue dataset, four evaluation metrics, and a knowledge augmentation method to enhance LLM performance in power marketing.

Result: Fine-tuned smaller models (e.g., LLama3-8B) outperformed GPT-4o in professionalism and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: ElectriQ provides a foundation for developing domain-specific LLMs for power marketing, demonstrating the potential of fine-tuned smaller models.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

### [121] [A Language Model-Driven Semi-Supervised Ensemble Framework for Illicit Market Detection Across Deep/Dark Web and Social Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22912)
*Navid Yazdanjue,Morteza Rakhshaninejad,Hossein Yazdanjouei,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Mikko S. Niemela,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hierarchical classification framework combines fine-tuned language models and semi-supervised ensemble learning to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms, outperforming baselines with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illicit marketplaces on concealed internet platforms pose detection challenges due to limited labeled data, evolving language, and structural heterogeneity.

Method: Uses ModernBERT for semantic representation, supplemented by engineered features, and a two-stage classification pipeline with semi-supervised ensemble learning.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (0.96489), F1-score (0.93467), and TMCC (0.95388), outperforming baselines like BERT and DarkBERT.

Conclusion: The framework is robust, generalizes well, and effectively detects illicit content in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [122] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining ML models and LLMs improves subject analysis in libraries by guiding LLM predictions and post-editing to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject analysis in libraries is crucial but underexplored with LLMs, which often over-generate or hallucinate. Traditional ML struggles with unseen cases.

Method: A hybrid framework integrates ML models to predict optimal LCSH labels and post-edit LLM outputs, ensuring vocabulary-aligned results.

Result: The hybrid approach yields more controlled and accurate subject term predictions compared to standalone LLMs or ML models.

Conclusion: Combining ML and LLMs enhances subject analysis by mitigating hallucinations and improving alignment with LCSH.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [123] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel KG integration method focusing on context matching, combining label and triple matching techniques to improve entity-matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG integration methods overlook context matching, which is crucial for real-world KGs with diverse sources and complexities.

Method: The method uses string manipulation, fuzzy matching, and vector similarity for label matching, followed by triple matching to enhance accuracy.

Result: The approach outperforms leading systems in the OAEI competition and supervised methods, achieving high accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses context matching in KGs and introduces a new dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

### [124] [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22915)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper rigorously defines and analyzes hallucination in LLMs, distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic types, and introduces a hallucination risk metric. It surveys detection and mitigation strategies, proposes a unified workflow, and outlines evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of hallucination in LLMs by providing formal definitions, theoretical analyses, and practical solutions.

Method: Uses learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes, Rademacher complexity) to derive hallucination risk bounds. Surveys detection (uncertainty estimation, confidence calibration) and mitigation (retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning) strategies.

Result: Proposes a unified workflow for detection and mitigation, along with evaluation protocols (datasets, metrics).

Conclusion: Lays theoretical and practical foundations to tackle hallucination in LLMs, offering guidelines for future research and implementation.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [125] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a temporal-aware RAG framework to address the limitation of standard RAG in handling longitudinal queries, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with longitudinal queries due to its inability to ensure temporal coherence in retrieved evidence.

Method: The framework disentangles queries into subject and temporal components, using a specialized retriever for temporally coherent evidence.

Result: Empirical results show 13% to 27% accuracy gains over standard RAG on the ADQAB benchmark.

Conclusion: The work provides a validated solution for RAG systems to handle complex, time-sensitive queries.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

### [126] [Semantic Convergence: Investigating Shared Representations Across Scaled LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22918)
*Daniel Son,Sanjana Rathore,Andrew Rufail,Adrian Simon,Daniel Zhang,Soham Dave,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores feature universality in Gemma-2 language models of different scales, finding middle layers share the strongest concept overlap, supporting universality as a basis for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if language models of varying scales converge on similar internal concepts, reinforcing universality for cross-model interpretability.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) pipeline on residual-stream activations, aligns features via correlation, and compares with SVCCA and RSA. Extends to multi-token subspaces.

Result: Middle layers show the strongest feature overlap, while early and late layers are less similar. Multi-token subspaces also exhibit semantic similarity.

Conclusion: Large language models share interpretable features across scales, supporting universality as a foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [127] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using pre-trial registration data, achieving 77.6% AUC for classification and 18.6% RMSE for regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical trial design by predicting SAE outcomes early, avoiding terminations and unnecessary risks to participants.

Method: Used transfer learning with pretrained models (ClinicalT5, BioBERT) for feature extraction and developed a sliding window method for long texts. Two models: a classifier (AUC) and a regression model (RMSE).

Result: Best model achieved 77.6% AUC for classification and 18.6% RMSE for regression. Sliding window method improved performance.

Conclusion: Pre-trial SAE prediction is feasible and can enhance trial design and safety monitoring.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

### [128] [Discrete Tokenization for Multimodal LLMs: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22920)
*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a structured survey of discrete tokenization methods for large language models (LLMs), focusing on vector quantization (VQ) techniques, their challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs necessitates efficient discrete tokenization methods, yet a comprehensive survey on VQ techniques for LLMs is lacking.

Method: The work categorizes 8 VQ variants, analyzing their principles, training dynamics, and integration with LLMs, while also reviewing applications in classical, single-modality, and multimodal LLM systems.

Result: The survey highlights challenges like codebook collapse and unstable gradients, and identifies emerging research directions such as dynamic quantization and unified tokenization frameworks.

Conclusion: This survey bridges traditional VQ and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference for efficient multimodal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [129] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in language models by cascading predictions through multiple models until correctness is achieved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and hallucinations of language models, ensuring correctness by leveraging multiple models.

Method: Propose the LMC algorithm, where responses are validated against candidate answers, and incorrect predictions are passed to slower, more accurate models iteratively.

Result: LMC significantly improved prediction speed and accuracy for extracting patient dates of birth from medical documents, reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: The LMC algorithm is a novel contribution to knowledge extraction, warranting further exploration.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

### [130] [Predicting stock prices with ChatGPT-annotated Reddit sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22922)
*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if social media sentiment predicts stock movements, focusing on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets for GameStop and AMC. It finds weak correlation with prices, while comment volume and Google trends show stronger signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of online sentiment, especially from retail investors on platforms like Reddit, on stock market movements.

Method: Analyzed sentiment using two existing methods and a new ChatGPT-annotated RoBERTa model for informal language. Used correlation and causality metrics.

Result: Weak correlation between social media sentiment and stock prices; comment volume and Google trends were stronger predictors.

Conclusion: Traditional sentiment analysis may not fully capture market-moving discussions, highlighting the complexity of retail investor behavior.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

### [131] [How and Where to Translate? The Impact of Translation Strategies in Cross-lingual LLM Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22923)
*Aman Gupta,Yingying Zhuang,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates prompt translation strategies in multilingual RAG-based systems, showing optimized strategies improve cross-lingual knowledge sharing and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance variability in multilingual LLMs and unclear impact of prompt translation strategies in RAG systems.

Method: Systematic evaluation of prompt translation strategies (pre-translation and cross-lingual prompting) for classification tasks with RAG-enhanced LLMs.

Result: Optimized prompting strategies significantly improve knowledge sharing across languages and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Advocates for multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization, especially for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

### [132] [Using Sentiment Analysis to Investigate Peer Feedback by Native and Non-Native English Speakers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22924)
*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how native vs. non-native English speaker status impacts peer feedback in online U.S. CS courses, revealing differences in sentiment and ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of language background in peer feedback experiences in online graduate CS courses with many international students.

Method: Analyzed sentiment of peer reviews from 500 students using a Twitter-roBERTa-based model, correlating sentiment scores with language background.

Result: Native English speakers rate feedback less favorably; non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment. Interactions with sex and age were significant.

Conclusion: Language background modestly but complexly influences peer feedback experiences, with implications for online pedagogy.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

### [133] [Hierarchical Memory for High-Efficiency Long-Term Reasoning in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22925)
*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents to improve memory organization and retrieval, outperforming baselines in long-term dialogue tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory mechanisms for LLM Agents lack structured organization and efficient retrieval, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: H-MEM organizes memory hierarchically by semantic abstraction and uses index-based routing for efficient retrieval.

Result: The method outperforms five baselines on the LoCoMo dataset, showing effectiveness in long-term dialogue.

Conclusion: H-MEM enhances LLM Agents' reasoning by improving memory structure and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

### [134] [Multi-Relation Extraction in Entity Pairs using Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22926)
*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel input embedding method for document-level relation extraction, focusing on global context and multi-sentence reasoning to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture the complete document context for relation extraction, as they only focus on sentences where entities appear.

Method: A new input encoding approach represents entities as standalone segments, leveraging global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning.

Result: Tested on DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL datasets, the method accurately predicts relationships in document-level settings.

Conclusion: The research advances global context modeling and enhances practical NLP applications by improving relationship detection and interpretability.

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

### [135] [PRGB Benchmark: A Robust Placeholder-Assisted Algorithm for Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22927)
*Zhehao Tan,Yihan Jiao,Dan Yang,Lei Liu,Jie Feng,Duolin Sun,Yue Shen,Jian Wang,Peng Wei,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark, a fine-grained benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in RAG systems, focusing on filtering, combination, and reasoning. It highlights LLMs' limitations in error resilience and context faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack granular evaluation of LLM-specific capabilities in RAG systems, focusing only on overall performance.

Method: The authors propose a placeholder-based approach to decouple LLM contributions and introduce a multi-level benchmark (Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark) with dimensions like filtering, combination, and reasoning.

Result: Experiments reveal LLMs' limitations in RAG systems, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a reproducible framework for improving RAG systems, addressing gaps in current evaluations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

### [136] [How does Chain of Thought Think? Mechanistic Interpretability of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Sparse Autoencoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22928)
*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates the faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing that CoT enhances interpretability and modular reasoning in high-capacity models like Pythia-2.8B, but not in smaller ones like Pythia-70M.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if CoT-generated thoughts truly reflect the internal reasoning process of LLMs and to assess the causal impact of CoT features.

Method: Combined sparse autoencoders with activation patching to analyze monosemantic features in Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B while solving GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain prompting.

Result: CoT features significantly improved answer accuracy in Pythia-2.8B but not in Pythia-70M, with higher activation sparsity and interpretability scores in the larger model.

Conclusion: CoT induces more interpretable and modular internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its effectiveness as a structured prompting method.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

### [137] [EH-Benchmark Ophthalmic Hallucination Benchmark and Agent-Driven Top-Down Traceable Reasoning Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22929)
*Xiaoyu Pan,Yang Bai,Ke Zou,Yang Zhou,Jun Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yih-Chung Tham,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark is introduced to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ophthalmic diagnosis, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face accuracy issues due to hallucinations from limited ophthalmic knowledge, visual reasoning gaps, and lack of multimodal data. Existing benchmarks fail to address these effectively.

Method: Proposes EH-Benchmark, categorizing hallucinations into Visual Understanding and Logical Composition. Introduces a three-phase framework: Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation.

Result: The multi-agent framework significantly reduces hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability in MLLMs.

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark provides a robust solution to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, advancing ophthalmic diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Shalini Jangra,Suparna De,Nishanth Sastry,Saeed Fadaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset for PII-revealing text detection, addressing privacy risks in social media by using LLMs to generate realistic yet unlinkable data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable research on PII privacy risks without exposing real user data, given the lack of open-source labeled datasets.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 19 PII categories and used LLMs (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, zephyr-7b-beta) with sequential prompting to create synthetic Reddit-like posts.

Result: A synthetic dataset meeting reproducibility, unlinkability, and indistinguishability criteria, released openly for research.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset facilitates reproducible research into PII privacy risks while safeguarding user privacy.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

### [139] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG dynamically adjusts context compression rates for RAG, improving efficiency without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed compression rates in RAG lead to inefficiency—over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones.

Method: Uses a hierarchical compressor and context selector to adaptively compress based on input complexity.

Result: Outperforms fixed-rate methods, achieves 4x faster inference, and maintains/improves accuracy.

Conclusion: ACC-RAG optimizes RAG efficiency dynamically, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews neural-symbolic systems integrating VLMs with external symbolic systems to improve visual-language understanding, addressing interpretability, adaptability, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language models lack interpretability, require retraining for new information, and struggle with logical reasoning. Neural-symbolic systems offer solutions.

Method: Systematic literature review categorizing techniques for enhancing VLMs using external symbolic systems.

Result: Neural-symbolic integration improves reasoning, memory, and interpretability while reducing retraining needs.

Conclusion: Combining VLMs with symbolic systems is a promising approach for advancing visual-language understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs during ontology matching tasks pose a significant challenge, necessitating a dedicated benchmark for evaluation and improvement.

Method: The dataset is derived from seven TBox datasets in OAEI, capturing hallucinations from ten LLMs, categorized into two main and six sub-categories.

ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deriving operational intelligence from confidential data, focusing on Knowledge Graph construction and NLP tools, and evaluates their performance in aviation maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance data confidentiality with integration and overcome NLP limitations in domain-specific knowledge structures like operations and maintenance.

Method: Breaks down Knowledge Extraction into components (NER, Coreference Resolution, etc.), evaluates 16 NLP tools and LLMs, and uses a public FAA dataset for testing.

Result: Observed significant performance limitations in NLP and LLM tools, highlighting challenges for trusted use in mission-critical industries.

Conclusion: Recommends enhancing trust in NLP/LLM tools and provides an open-source dataset for further evaluation in aviation and similar industries.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A comparative study of five LLMs (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek) in FinNLP tasks using 10-K filings, evaluating performance via human annotation, automated metrics, and diagnostics. GPT outperforms others in coherence and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic comparisons of LLMs in financial analysis are lacking despite their growing influence, prompting this study.

Method: Evaluated five LLMs using domain-specific prompts and three methodologies: human annotation, automated metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics.

Result: GPT performed best in coherence and relevance; Claude and Perplexity followed, while Gemini and DeepSeek showed more variability. Performance varied by company and prompt design.

Conclusion: GPT is the most reliable for FinNLP tasks, but prompt and source material sensitivity must be considered for optimal use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoE-Ops, a collaboration-of-expert framework for AIOps, combining a general-purpose LLM task classifier with retrieval-augmented generation to improve task routing and problem resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIOps models are limited to specific tasks, and combining multiple models can enhance efficiency, as shown in ensemble learning and LLM training.

Method: Proposes CoE-Ops, integrating a general-purpose LLM task classifier and retrieval-augmented generation for handling diverse AIOps tasks.

Result: CoE-Ops improves routing accuracy by 72% for high-level tasks, enhances problem resolution by 8% over single models, and outperforms MoE models by 14%.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops effectively addresses AIOps challenges by leveraging collaboration of experts and retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve QA for technical documents by integrating graph representations of flowcharts from VLMs into a text-based RAG system, showing improved retrieval and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based RAG systems struggle with QA for questions answered by figures in technical documents, necessitating a solution that incorporates visual data.

Method: The approach involves processing documents, classifying images, building graph representations using VLMs, and integrating them with text embeddings for retrieval.

Result: Graph representations from fine-tuned VLMs show lower edit distance to ground truth, and the method achieves good retrieval performance with text-based models.

Conclusion: The method enhances QA for technical documents by leveraging visual data without requiring VLMs during inference, offering cost benefits.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

### [149] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE is a framework to improve factual accuracy in LLMs' reasoning steps, combining fact-checking, reinforcement learning, and interpretability modules. It shows significant improvements in factual robustness while maintaining benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the risk of factual inaccuracies in LLMs' reasoning steps, which can mislead users in high-stakes domains like healthcare and legal analysis.

Method: Integrates a fact-checking classifier, GRPO reinforcement learning, and a mechanistic interpretability module to enhance reasoning accuracy.

Result: Achieves up to 49.90% improvement in factual robustness, with maintained or improved performance on benchmarks like Math-500 and GPQA.

Conclusion: RELIANCE provides a foundation for future training methods targeting factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT is a temporal survival analysis framework that processes sequential EHR data using word embeddings and signature extraction to improve survival model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods struggle with complex textual data in EHRs, limiting their effectiveness in healthcare applications.

Method: SigBERT extracts word embeddings, averages them into sentence embeddings, and applies signature extraction to capture temporal dynamics. These features are used in a LASSO-penalized Cox model for risk estimation.

Result: Achieved a C-index score of 0.75 on an oncology dataset, demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: SigBERT effectively integrates sequential EHR data for better survival analysis, advancing narrative-based risk estimation.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an expedited validation process for code-based algorithms in claims databases using NLP and adaptive sampling, reducing review time and resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and feasibility of validating code-based algorithms in large claims databases, which traditionally require extensive manual chart reviews.

Method: Combines NLP to speed up human chart reviews and a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined stopping criteria to optimize resource use.

Result: NLP reduced review time by 40%, and adaptive sampling could have avoided 77% of chart reviews without significant loss of precision.

Conclusion: This approach enables more routine validation of algorithms, improving the reliability of findings from database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

### [152] [Opacity as Authority: Arbitrariness and the Preclusion of Contestation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22944)
*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper redefines arbitrariness as a functional mechanism in human systems, extending Saussure's linguistic concept to law and social dynamics. It introduces a chain linking motivation to contestability and formalizes arbitrariness using Shannon's entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conflation of arbitrariness with injustice and demonstrate its foundational role in structuring systems like language, law, and social interactions.

Method: Extends Saussure's concept of arbitrariness to other domains, introduces the "Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, and formalizes arbitrariness using Shannon's entropy model (A = H(L|M)).

Result: Arbitrariness is shown as a neutral, functional mechanism that protects authority from accountability while enabling system operation. The framework also applies to AI explainability.

Conclusion: Arbitrariness is a deliberate design feature in human systems, serving both control and care, with potential applications in understanding AI systems.

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

### [153] [C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968)
*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for evaluating Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) to address gaps in understanding their effectiveness in human-like conversations, compared to text-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the research gap in evaluating SDMs' practical effectiveness in handling complexities of spoken dialogue, such as ambiguity and context-dependency, compared to text-based LLMs.

Method: Creation of a benchmark dataset with 1,079 instances in English and Chinese, paired with an LLM-based evaluation method aligned with human judgment.

Result: The dataset and evaluation method enable comprehensive assessment of SDMs in addressing spoken dialogue challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and evaluation method provide a foundation for advancing SDM research and development.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

*Valeria de Paiva,Qiyue Gao,Hai Hu,Pavel Kovalev,Yikang Liu,Lawrence S. Moss,Zhiheng Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs can perform NLI tasks on mathematical texts (Math NLI), using human-annotated and LLM-generated corpora. Findings show mixed results: LLMs can match human performance in some cases but struggle with mathematical language and basic inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability in handling NLI tasks for mathematical texts, addressing gaps in understanding their performance and consistency in this domain.

Method: Constructed a Math NLI corpus with human-provided hypotheses and labels, and compared it to LLM-generated hypotheses. Evaluated performance and inter-group consistency of LLMs.

Result: Mixed outcomes: LLMs can approximate human performance in certain settings but falter with mathematical language and basic inferences. They are less prone to hypothesis-only errors than previous models.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in Math NLI but have limitations. The provided corpora aim to support future research in this area.

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

TL;DR: The paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) without fine-tuning, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether ICL with LLMs can effectively perform FSP tasks without the need for model fine-tuning.

Method: Automatically generates task-specific prompts for Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role Labeling (FSRL) using the FrameNet database, then evaluates six LLMs.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL on violent event-related frames.

Conclusion: ICL is a practical and effective alternative to fine-tuning for domain-specific FSP tasks.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE is a dynamic, context-aware extension of RoPE for positional encoding in Transformers, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE's static frequency patterns limit context-sensitive modeling, prompting the need for a more adaptable solution.

Method: CARoPE dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns using token embeddings, integrating input-dependent phase shifts into the rotary mechanism.

Result: CARoPE outperforms RoPE and baselines on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset, achieving lower perplexity and faster training.

Conclusion: CARoPE is a scalable, expressive, and efficient upgrade for positional encoding in Transformers.

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMART-Editor is a framework for global coherence in layout and content editing across structured and unstructured domains, outperforming baselines with reward-guided strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior models perform local edits but lack global coherence, motivating the need for a framework that preserves consistency across edits.

Method: Uses Reward-Refine (inference-time refinement) and RewardDPO (training-time preference optimization) to align layouts and content.

Result: Outperforms baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with 15% gains in structured settings and advantages on natural images.

Conclusion: Reward-guided planning ensures semantically consistent and visually aligned edits, validated by automatic and human evaluations.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in

TL;DR: A component-based retrieval architecture improves scalability for LLM-based natural language interfaces to enterprise databases by decomposing schemas and metadata into semantic units for targeted retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLM-based natural language interfaces to enterprise-level data catalogs is challenging due to reliance on domain-specific fine-tuning and underutilization of semantic context in metadata.

Method: Introduces a component-based retrieval architecture that decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, separately indexed for targeted retrieval, prioritizing table identification and column-level information.

Result: Outperforms baselines in recall and accuracy over massive databases with varying structure and metadata, maintaining manageable context budget.

Conclusion: The solution enables practical text-to-SQL systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized fine-tuning, addressing scalability gaps.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' handling of ambiguous Chinese text, revealing their fragility and overconfidence in interpretation, and calls for improved approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study LLMs' trustworthiness when encountering ambiguous narrative text, especially in Chinese, and assess their behavior compared to humans.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset of ambiguous sentences with disambiguated pairs, categorized into 3 main and 9 subcategories, and tested LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, failing to distinguish ambiguous text, showing overconfidence in single interpretations, and overthinking possible meanings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in handling ambiguity, impacting real-world applications, necessitating better approaches for uncertainty in language understanding.

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

TL;DR: ISO-Bench evaluates models' ability to infer causal dependencies between visual and text steps, revealing poor performance (best F1: 0.57) and suggesting improvement areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding causal relationships across modalities in real-world environments.

Method: Introduces ISO-Bench, a benchmark where models decide if a visual step occurs before or after a text step in a task.

Result: Frontier models perform poorly (best F1: 0.57), with humans outperforming (0.98 F1). Chain-of-thought reasoning offers slight gains (up to 0.62 F1).

Conclusion: The study identifies gaps in multimodal causal understanding and suggests directions for improvement.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies implicit user feedback from interaction logs to improve language models, analyzing its occurrence and utility, finding it useful for short tasks but not complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language models continuously without disruptive direct feedback by leveraging implicit feedback from user interactions.

Method: Analyzed user feedback in two datasets (WildChat and LMSYS), studying its occurrence and learning signals for model improvement.

Result: Feedback content (not just polarity) improves performance on short tasks (MTBench) but not complex ones (WildBench); usefulness depends on prompt quality.

Conclusion: Implicit user feedback has potential but limitations, with effectiveness tied to task complexity and prompt quality.

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS is a novel ensemble method for LLMs that learns confidence from internal representations, outperforming traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble methods for LLMs rely on simplistic approaches, ignoring varying model confidence in different contexts.

Method: LENS trains lightweight linear confidence predictors using layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities to weight predictions.

Result: LENS significantly outperforms traditional ensemble methods on multiple-choice and boolean QA tasks.

Conclusion: Internal representations offer valuable signals for model confidence, enhancing ensemble learning without extra computation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, hardware-optimized GPU kernels in deep learning workloads drives the demand for automated, AI-generated solutions.

Method: GEAK uses LLMs and Reflexion-style feedback to generate Triton-based GPU kernels, specifically optimized for AMD GPUs like MI300X and MI250.

Result: GEAK achieves 63% correctness and up to 2.59X speedup compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GEAK demonstrates the potential of AI-driven code generation to democratize expert-level kernel performance and accelerate hardware adoption.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method leverages negative samples to improve positive example selection for few-shot in-context learning (ICL), outperforming methods using only positive examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods focus on positive samples, ignoring the potential of negative samples to enhance performance.

Method: Construct positive and negative sample corpora using Zero-Shot-Cot, then use semantic similarity to select and combine examples for ICL demonstrations.

Result: The approach outperforms methods relying solely on positive examples, proving negative samples aid in better positive example selection.

Conclusion: Negative samples provide valuable information for improving ICL performance by refining positive example selection.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

*Carolina Zheng,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Sweta Karlekar,Claudia Shi,Achille Nazaret,Asif Mallik,Amir Feder,David M. Blei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTMs use sparse autoencoders to create interpretable, feature-based topics, outperforming traditional and neural topic models in coherence and enabling controllable text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models fail to capture abstract semantics due to bag-of-words limitations, and neural variants are constrained by word-list topics.

Method: MTMs leverage sparse autoencoders to define topics over semantically rich features, enabling deeper themes and controllable generation.

Result: MTMs match or exceed baselines in coherence, are preferred by topic judge, and allow effective steering of LLM outputs.

Conclusion: MTMs offer a more expressive and controllable approach to topic modeling, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAP-GPT adapts TableGPT2 for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using structured biomarker data, outperforming general-purpose LLMs and tabular foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease requires analyzing heterogeneous biomarkers, which LLMs can address with their multimodal and interpretable capabilities.

Method: The TAP-GPT framework uses few-shot tabular prompts and finetunes TableGPT2 with qLoRA for binary classification of AD or cognitively normal cases.

Result: TAP-GPT outperforms advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model in AD prediction.

Conclusion: This is the first LLM application for tabular biomarker data prediction, enabling future LLM-driven biomedical informatics frameworks.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

*Sneha Oram,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores pragmatic reasoning in LLMs for mental health, introduces the P-ReMe dataset, and benchmarks models like Mistral and Qwen. It also studies stigma using StiPRompts, finding Claude-3.5-haiku handles it best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in explainability and dialogue discourse for mental health chatbots by investigating pragmatic reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Introduces P-ReMe dataset, defines pragmatic phenomena (implicature, presupposition), formulates tasks, and benchmarks models (Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, Qwen). Uses StiPRompts to study stigma with GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, Claude-3.5-haiku.

Result: Mistral and Qwen excel in reasoning; Claude-3.5-haiku handles stigma more responsibly than GPT-4o mini and Deepseek-chat.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in pragmatic reasoning for mental health, with Claude-3.5-haiku leading in stigma handling.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

*Shimanto Bhowmik,Tawsif Tashwar Dipto,Md Sazzad Islam,Sheryl Hsu,Tahsin Reasat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates challenges in Bengali NLP, evaluates 10 LLMs on translated datasets, and identifies performance gaps and tokenization efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bengali is underrepresented in NLP, and its unique linguistic structure and lack of standardized benchmarks hinder progress.

Method: Evaluated 10 LLMs on 8 translated datasets, analyzed errors, and studied tokenization impact.

Result: Performance gaps for Bengali vs. English, robustness in DeepSeek, and an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Highlights need for better datasets and evaluation methods, aiming to advance NLP for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Super Experts' (SEs) in MoE LLMs, which are crucial for model performance. Pruning SEs significantly degrades performance, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning. SEs exhibit rare activation outliers and influence attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the heterogeneous importance of experts in MoE LLMs and identify critical experts (SEs) that significantly impact model performance.

Method: Analyzes SEs through activation patterns, pruning experiments, and task performance evaluation. Investigates their role in attention mechanisms.

Result: SEs are rare but critical; pruning them causes performance drops. They influence attention sinks and are model-specific.

Conclusion: SEs are vital for MoE LLM performance, particularly in reasoning tasks, and their pruning disrupts attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Laura Pinnavaia,Vojimir Ranitovic,Elisabetta Rocchetti,Alice Tuveri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines GPT-4o-mini's implicit moderation of sensitive content, finding systematic sanitization and evaluates its zero-shot sensitivity classification against traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs implicitly moderate sensitive content without explicit training, a less studied aspect compared to explicit moderation.

Method: Empirical analysis of GPT-4o-mini's paraphrasing of sensitive content and evaluation of sensitivity shifts, along with zero-shot classification performance comparison.

Result: GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content to less sensitive classes, reducing derogatory and taboo language, and shows competitive zero-shot classification.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o-mini implicitly sanitize language effectively, suggesting potential for implicit moderation without explicit training.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

*Daeyong Kwon,SeungHeon Doh,Juhan Nam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MusT-RAG enhances LLMs for music tasks using RAG, outperforming fine-tuning with a specialized database (MusWikiDB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack music-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in music-related tasks like MQA.

Method: Proposes MusT-RAG, combining RAG with MusWikiDB for retrieval and context use in inference/fine-tuning.

Result: MusT-RAG outperforms fine-tuning, improving performance on MQA benchmarks and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MusT-RAG effectively adapts general-purpose LLMs for music tasks, with MusWikiDB proving superior to general corpora.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeQoDO is a method for autonomously constructing task-oriented dialogue ontologies using LLMs without supervision, outperforming transfer learning and scaling well for larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack explainability due to reliance on parametric knowledge, while traditional TOD systems require manual ontology construction. TeQoDO aims to bridge this gap.

Method: TeQoDO uses an LLM's SQL capabilities and dialogue theory prompts to autonomously build ontologies without supervision.

Result: TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning, scales to larger datasets, and performs competitively on dialogue state tracking.

Conclusion: TeQoDO advances LLM explainability by enabling unsupervised ontology construction, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPCC benchmark evaluates MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning, revealing significant challenges and poor performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the ability to assess real-world multimodal planning capabilities and ignore constraints across modalities.

Method: Introduces MPCC with three real-world tasks (Flight, Calendar, Meeting Planning) and complex constraints (budget, temporal, spatial) at graded difficulty levels.

Result: Closed-source models achieve 21.3% feasible plans; open-source models average below 11%. MLLMs struggle with constraint complexity and traditional prompting fails.

Conclusion: MPCC formalizes multimodal constraints, provides an evaluation framework, and underscores the need for constraint-aware reasoning advancements.

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Causal2Vec enhances decoder-only LLMs for embedding tasks without altering their architecture or adding computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embedding tasks with decoder-only LLMs either remove causal attention masks (hurting semantic extraction) or use extra input (increasing costs).

Method: Causal2Vec prepends a BERT-style pre-encoded Contextual token to the LLM input and combines hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens for embeddings.

Result: Achieves top performance on MTEB, reduces sequence length by 85%, and cuts inference time by 82%.

Conclusion: Causal2Vec is a lightweight, efficient solution for improving decoder-only LLMs in embedding tasks.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores locally deployable, free language models as alternatives to cloud-based AI for translation, focusing on data privacy and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data privacy, security, and equitable access in cloud-based AI translation solutions.

Method: Evaluates three open-source models on CPU-based platforms, comparing them to commercial chatbots, focusing on functional performance.

Result: Local deployment offers benefits like enhanced data control and privacy, though it introduces challenges.

Conclusion: Supports democratizing AI by making LLMs more accessible, especially for individual translators and small businesses.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum is an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework using multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization to address redundancy and complex document relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-document summarization struggle with single-relational graphs and predefined cluster numbers, limiting their ability to model rich relationships and adaptively reduce redundancy.

Method: The framework constructs a multi-relational graph for semantic and discourse relations, uses structural entropy minimization for adaptive clustering, and employs a position-aware compression mechanism for summary generation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show MRGSEM-Sum outperforms unsupervised methods and rivals supervised models and large language models in performance. Human evaluation confirms high summary quality.

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum effectively addresses redundancy and relationship complexity in multi-document summarization, achieving near-human-level performance.

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

TL;DR: An enhanced Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework for Arabic NLP, featuring Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) to improve semantic relevance modeling and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underrepresentation of Arabic in NLP research and its unique challenges like complex morphology and dialect variations.

Method: Introduces ARS, an adaptive scoring function, and integrates pre-trained Arabic language models with architectural refinements.

Result: Improved retrieval performance and ranking accuracy for Arabic question answering.

Conclusion: The framework advances Arabic NLP by providing a tailored solution for semantic relevance and retrieval, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces proactive critical thinking in AI, where models actively seek missing information to resolve queries, and evaluates it using GSM-MC and GSM-MCE benchmarks. Reinforcement learning improves model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on passive critical thinking (rejecting flawed queries), but proactive critical thinking (seeking missing info) is needed for better user collaboration.

Method: Proposed proactive critical thinking and created GSM-MC (missing info) and GSM-MCE (misleading info) benchmarks. Used reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance model performance.

Result: Models like Qwen3 and Llama struggle with proactive critical thinking, but RL boosts Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC.

Conclusion: Proactive critical thinking improves AI-user collaboration, and RL is effective in enhancing this capability.

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores fine-tuning LLMs to generate role-specific responses in enterprise settings, evaluating three modeling strategies and two datasets for performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in existing safety methods by enabling role-specific access control in LLMs for enterprise use.

Method: Three strategies: BERT-based classifier, LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. Evaluated using two datasets (adapted and synthetic).

Result: Assessed performance across organizational structures and robustness to prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: LLMs can be fine-tuned for role-specific access, with potential for enterprise deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSEDB, a framework to evaluate LLMs in clinical settings, revealing moderate performance with domain-specific models outperforming general ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of LLMs in clinical decision support.

Method: Developed CSEDB with expert consensus, tested six LLMs using 2,069 Q&A items across 26 departments.

Result: Moderate overall performance (57.2%), with domain-specific LLMs outperforming general models, especially in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861).

Conclusion: CSEDB provides a standardized metric for evaluating clinical LLMs, aiding safer and more effective deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

*Keer Lu,Zheng Liang,Youquan Li,Jiejun Tan,Da Pan,Shusen Zhang,Guosheng Dong,Huang Leng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-R³ is a medical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework using progressive reinforcement learning to jointly optimize retrieval and reasoning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack joint optimization of retrieval and reasoning in medical scenarios, rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning, and inadequately address domain-specific demands.

Method: Develops logical reasoning first, then optimizes retrieval adaptively, and finally jointly optimizes retrieval-reasoning coordination using reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R³ surpassing GPT-4o-mini by 3.93% and Qwen2.5-14B + Med-R³ by 13.53%.

Conclusion: Med-R³ effectively addresses the limitations of current methods, demonstrating superior performance in medical retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T-Detect introduces a novel method for detecting machine-generated text by using a heavy-tailed discrepancy score from the Student's t-distribution, outperforming existing zero-shot detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detection methods for machine-generated text, especially adversarial or non-native English texts, which challenge traditional Gaussian-based statistical assumptions.

Method: T-Detect replaces Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's t-distribution, leveraging leptokurtosis observed in adversarial texts.

Result: T-Detect improves AUROC by up to 3.9% and achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC 0.926) on the RAID benchmark.

Conclusion: T-Detect provides a theoretically justified, robust statistical foundation for text detection, validated by superior performance under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffLoRA combines differential attention with LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation, showing mixed results but notable gains in specific tasks like HumanEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Transformer performance by integrating differential attention with LoRA, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: DiffLoRA uses low-rank adapters on positive and negative attention terms, retaining LoRA's efficiency while leveraging differential attention.

Result: Mixed performance across NLP tasks, with a significant +11-point improvement over LoRA in HumanEval.

Conclusion: DiffLoRA shows promise in specific domains but underperforms compared to other fine-tuning methods in most tasks.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting and cleaning hate speech in Arabic text using deep learning and transformers, achieving high accuracy in detection and decent results in text masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing issue of hate speech in social media by developing methods to detect and clean such content in Arabic text.

Method: Used deep learning models and transformers for hate speech detection and treated text cleaning as a machine translation task.

Result: Achieved 92% Macro F1 score and 95% accuracy in detection, and a BLEU score of 0.3 for text masking.

Conclusion: The methods are effective for hate speech detection and cleaning, with results comparable to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules in knowledge graphs, evaluating their correctness and clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of logical rules in knowledge graphs, which are often complex and hard for humans to understand.

Method: Extracts logical rules using AMIE 3.5.1 from datasets FB15k-237, FB-CVT-REV, and FB+CVT-REV, and tests prompting strategies like zero- and few-shot prompting with human and automatic evaluation.

Result: Promising performance in explanation correctness and clarity, though challenges remain.

Conclusion: Large language models show potential for generating understandable explanations for logical rules in knowledge graphs, but further research is needed.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cascaded question disclosure framework to better evaluate LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, showing it provides more accurate comparisons and reduces performance gaps compared to standard QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard QA benchmarks indirectly assess LLMs' problem-solving abilities, leading to overestimated performance differences.

Method: A cascaded question disclosure framework collects model responses stagewise, revealing partial question information to elicit generalized reasoning.

Result: The approach improves model comparisons, induces better reasoning traces, and narrows performance gaps in diverse QA datasets.

Conclusion: The cascaded framework offers a more accurate and scalable evaluation of LLMs' problem-solving capabilities than standard QA benchmarks.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

TL;DR: NeuroAR, a generative autoregressive transformer model, synthesizes brain aging trajectories with high fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like LDM and GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain aging synthesis is crucial for clinical and computational neuroscience but faces challenges like high-dimensional data and subtle structural changes.

Method: NeuroAR uses autoregressive transformers to predict future brain scans by concatenating token embeddings of previous and future scans, guided by cross-attention with age information.

Result: NeuroAR outperforms LDM and GANs in image fidelity and realism, validated by a pre-trained age predictor.

Conclusion: NeuroAR effectively models subject-specific brain aging trajectories, offering superior performance over existing generative models.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: Address gaps in prior research on language coverage, cognitive context, and granularity of LLM involvement in cheating detection.

Method: Dataset of 69 participants completing writing tasks under three conditions (bona fide, paraphrasing, transcribing ChatGPT). Features extracted and evaluated under Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.

Result: Temporal features excel in Cognition-Aware scenarios; rhythmic features generalize better cross-cognition. Models outperform humans, especially in detecting paraphrased responses.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics reliably detect LLM-assisted writing across cognitive demands and strategies, including paraphrasing and transcribing.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of MLPs (poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, difficulty capturing localized features) drive the adoption of KANs, which offer better modeling of complex nonlinear interactions.

Method: The review examines KAN-based models from three perspectives: data-driven learning, physics-informed modeling, and deep operator learning, focusing on architecture, training, and application efficacy.

Result: KANs outperform MLPs in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, demonstrating superior capability in capturing complex dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper identifies challenges in KAN development (e.g., computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees) and suggests future research directions to enhance robustness and scalability.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture using deep learning and XAI, validated with US meteorological data, showing strong predictive accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate extremes threaten agriculture, but traditional single-hazard methods fail to capture complex interactions. A reliable, adaptive EWS is needed.

Method: Combines sequential deep learning (BiLSTM) and XAI (TimeSHAP) to predict and explain multi-hazard events like floods and heatwaves.

Result: Demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, especially with BiLSTM, and provides temporal explanations for climatic feature impacts.

Conclusion: Advances explainable multi-hazard EWS, aiding proactive risk management and interdisciplinary trust in agriculture.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

TL;DR: FedCVD++ is an advanced federated learning framework for predicting coronary heart disease risk, combining parametric and non-parametric models while addressing FL challenges like communication overhead and class imbalance. It achieves state-of-the-art results and reduces bandwidth usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive systems in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction, given its global impact of over 17 million annual deaths.

Method: FedCVD++ integrates parametric (logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) and non-parametric (Random Forest, XGBoost) models. It introduces tree-subset sampling, XGBoost-based feature extraction, and federated SMOTE synchronization.

Result: Achieves F1-scores of 0.80 (federated XGBoost) and 0.81 (federated Random Forest), reduces communication overhead by 70%, and cuts bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while maintaining 95% accuracy.

Conclusion: FedCVD++ is the first practical integration of non-parametric models into federated healthcare systems, offering a scalable, privacy-preserving solution validated under real-world clinical constraints.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model, predicts hyperlocal UTCI for urban heat mitigation, outperforming traditional models in speed and accuracy, and aids in evaluating greening strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities need scalable tools to assess and mitigate outdoor heat stress exacerbated by climate change and urbanization, as traditional models are computationally intensive.

Method: GSM-UTCI uses a multimodal deep learning framework with FiLM architecture, integrating surface morphology, land cover, and meteorological data to predict UTCI.

Result: Achieves R2 of 0.9151 and MAE of 0.41°C, reducing inference time to under five minutes. Demonstrates cooling effects of landscape transformations in Philadelphia.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI is a scalable, precise tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling efficient evaluation of greening strategies.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,

### [193] [Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23009)
*Tom Sühr,Florian E. Dorner,Olawale Salaudeen,Augustin Kelava,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues against using human psychological tests to evaluate LLMs, calling for AI-specific evaluation frameworks instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretations of LLM performance on human tests are seen as flawed due to lack of empirical validation and theoretical justification.

Method: The paper critiques the practice of applying human tests to AI, highlighting issues like validity, bias, and prompt sensitivity.

Result: The authors demonstrate that human tests mischaracterize AI capabilities and traits.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for developing principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks to accurately assess AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [194] [Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010)
*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the inverse capabilities of multimodal latent spaces in AI models, finding they lack semantic coherence for inverse tasks despite optimization efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multimodal latent spaces, optimized for forward tasks, can support meaningful inverse mappings.

Method: An optimization-based framework is applied bidirectionally across Text-Image and Text-Audio modalities to infer input characteristics from outputs.

Result: Optimization produces textually aligned outputs but lacks perceptual coherence and semantic interpretability in inverse mappings.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces lack inherent structure for robust inverse mappings, highlighting the need for further research into invertible spaces.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

TL;DR: KLLM is a hardware-software co-design framework for efficient LLM inference using K-Means quantization and outlier detection, achieving significant speedups and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in weight and activation quantization (WAQ) for LLMs, including accuracy degradation and activation outliers, to enable efficient low-precision inference.

Method: Proposes KLLM with an index-based computation scheme for K-Means-quantized data and an outlier detection engine (Orizuru) for online inference.

Result: Achieves speedups of 9.67x and 7.03x, with energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x and 150.21x compared to A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM successfully addresses WAQ challenges, enabling efficient and accurate LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

*Aurélie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to study temporal and causal dynamics in process mining, revealing actor behavior's direct impact on process performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process mining overlooks temporal and causal dynamics from individual actor behavior, limiting understanding of real-world process complexity.

Method: Combines actor behavior analysis with Granger causality, using Group Lasso for lag selection on real-world event logs to identify influential lags.

Result: Identifies a small set of influential lags showing actor behavior directly impacts process performance, especially throughput time.

Conclusion: Actor-centric, time series-based methods provide nuanced insights into how individual behaviors drive process efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model was developed to predict vancomycin-related kidney injury in ICU patients using routine data, achieving strong accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is challenging but crucial for timely interventions in critically ill patients.

Method: Analyzed 10,288 ICU patients from MIMIC-IV, defined kidney injury by KDIGO criteria, and tested six algorithms with feature selection and interpretability tools (SHAP, ALE, Bayesian analysis).

Result: CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818), with phosphate, bilirubin, and Charlson index as key predictors. Bayesian analysis estimated a 60.5% mean risk in high-risk cases.

Conclusion: The model accurately predicts vancomycin-associated kidney injury, aiding early risk detection and intervention in critical care.

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

TL;DR: The paper explores local differential privacy in the thresholding bandit problem, proposing methods with strong privacy guarantees and theoretical performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in decision-making frameworks for bandit problems by ensuring local differential privacy.

Method: Uses a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism to identify arms with rewards above a threshold in fixed budget and fixed confidence settings.

Result: The methods provide strong privacy guarantees and match derived lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The work offers insights into privacy-preserving decision-making in bandit problems, with algorithms achieving near-optimal performance.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based foundation model for fracture prediction unifies diverse materials and loading conditions, reducing data needs and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fracture prediction is critical for safety and reliability, but current methods are limited by narrow datasets, lack of robustness, and high computational costs.

Method: A transformer-based architecture combines multimodal inputs (structured/unstructured meshes and text embeddings) to adapt flexibly across simulations without architectural changes.

Result: The model generalizes to unseen materials with minimal data, outperforming standard ML, and supports diverse tasks like time-to-failure estimation.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows, unifying fracture prediction under one architecture.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance and energy usage of edge devices (e.g., RPi, INCS, NJn, GCU) for AI inferences, focusing on trade-offs between model accuracy, inference time, power, and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive studies on edge devices' performance and energy usage for AI inferences motivates this research to aid informed device and model selection.

Method: The study rigorously characterizes traditional, neural network, and large language models on edge devices, analyzing trade-offs in F1 score, inference time, power, and memory usage.

Result: Findings highlight the impact of hardware/framework optimizations and model parameter tuning on balancing performance and resource usage for practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing edge AI deployments by addressing performance-energy trade-offs, aiding device and model selection.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiGG-E is an autoregressive model extending BiGG to learn joint distributions over weighted graphs efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep generative models lack joint distribution handling for weighted graphs and ignore nonlocal dependencies between edges and weights.

Method: BiGG-E extends BiGG to model weighted graphs, exploiting sparsity for efficient generation in O((n + m)log n) time.

Result: BiGG-E outperforms benchmarks in capturing weighted graph distributions while remaining scalable.

Conclusion: BiGG-E effectively addresses the limitations of existing models for weighted graph generation.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

TL;DR: FLOSS mitigates missing data impacts in federated learning caused by stragglers and user opt-out, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias and performance degradation in federated learning due to missing data from stragglers and user opt-out.

Method: Propose FLOSS, a system designed to handle missing data in federated learning, tested via simulations.

Result: Empirical simulations demonstrate FLOSS effectively mitigates missing data impacts.

Conclusion: FLOSS successfully addresses missing data challenges in federated learning, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

TL;DR: The paper explores how training conditions and input features impact the robustness and generalization of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions, finding noise-aware training beneficial in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work in computer vision shows correlations between ID and OOD accuracies, but this relationship is underexplored in audio-based models.

Method: Benchmarked neural architectures across evaluation sets, using Fairness (F) and Robustness (R) metrics to assess noise impact.

Result: Noise-aware training improves robustness in certain configurations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for speech model generalization.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

TL;DR: The paper explores observational multiplicity in probabilistic classification, where multiple models perform similarly but predict conflicting outcomes. It introduces regret as a measure of arbitrariness in predictions and proposes a method to estimate it, highlighting its impact on safety and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of arbitrariness in probabilistic classification, where competing models yield conflicting predictions, undermining interpretability and safety.

Method: The authors propose a measure of regret for probabilistic classification, quantifying how predictions could change due to variations in training labels. They also introduce a general-purpose method to estimate regret.

Result: Results show higher regret for certain groups in datasets, and the method demonstrates practical applications for improving safety through abstention and targeted data collection.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that estimating regret can enhance safety and interpretability in probabilistic classification tasks, offering actionable insights for real-world applications.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and difficulty in approximating high-frequency components (AHFC) in existing AI solvers for DEs.

Method: Proposes a DE-ruled first-principles data generation method and a reversible SDO AI solver leveraging Fourier transforms and attention-based Transformers.

Result: Demonstrates consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods on diverse DEs.

Conclusion: Makes AI solvers for DEs practical for broad applications in nature and engineering.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation require accurate spatio-temporal LST data, but satellite trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolution limit this.

Method: FuseTen combines Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS data using a generative architecture with attention, normalization, and PatchGAN discriminator for realism.

Result: FuseTen improves quantitative metrics by 32.06% and visual fidelity by 31.42% over baselines.

Conclusion: FuseTen is the first non-linear method to achieve daily 10 m LST resolution, addressing critical climate challenges.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NaN-propagation detects sparsity in black-box functions by using NaN values to trace dependencies, eliminating false negatives and improving gradient computation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finite-difference methods for sparsity detection in black-box functions produce false negatives due to coincidental zero gradients, leading to corrupted gradient calculations.

Method: The method systematically contaminates inputs with NaN and observes NaN outputs to reconstruct conservative sparsity patterns, leveraging IEEE 754 compliance. Advanced strategies like NaN payload encoding and handling branching code are also introduced.

Result: The approach achieved a 1.52x speedup on an aerospace wing weight model and detected dependencies missed by conventional methods.

Conclusion: NaN-propagation offers a robust, language-agnostic solution for sparsity detection, significantly improving gradient-based optimization workflows.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

TL;DR: DocsRay is a training-free system for understanding multimodal documents by combining pseudo-TOC generation and hierarchical RAG, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in understanding complex multimodal documents due to structural inconsistencies and limited training data.

Method: Uses multimodal LLMs for pseudo-TOC generation, zero-shot multimodal analysis, and hierarchical retrieval to process diverse document elements.

Result: Reduced query latency by 45% (3.89s to 2.12s) and achieved 64.7% accuracy on MMLongBench-Doc.

Conclusion: DocsRay efficiently processes multimodal documents without training, outperforming prior methods in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

*Charles O'Neill,Slava Chalnev,Chi Chi Zhao,Max Kirkby,Mudith Jayasekara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using a generator-agnostic observer model detects AI hallucinations via a linear probe on residual streams, outperforming baselines and enabling causal manipulation of hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of contextual hallucinations in AI-generated text, which remain unsupported by given context.

Method: Uses a linear probe on the residual stream of an observer model to detect hallucinations, identifying a transferable linear direction. Gradient-times-activation localizes the signal to sparse MLP activity.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 5-27 points, shows robust performance across model sizes, and causally manipulates hallucination rates.

Conclusion: Demonstrates internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific MLP sub-circuits, offering actionable insights for detection and mitigation.

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

### [211] [Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257)
*Jiawei Liu,Chenwang Wu,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU), an efficient machine unlearning method inspired by incremental learning, addressing computational challenges of traditional influence-based unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns necessitate machine unlearning, but existing methods like influence-based unlearning are computationally expensive due to Hessian matrix calculations.

Method: The paper links unlearning to incremental learning, proposing IAU, which leverages efficient gradient optimization instead of costly Hessian computations.

Result: IAU achieves a balance between removal guarantee, efficiency, and model utility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: IAU provides a practical solution for machine unlearning by reframing it as an incremental learning problem, supported by cognitive science insights.

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

*Hui Yi Leong,Yuqing Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm is a dynamic multi-agent system (MAS) framework that uses reinforcement learning and adaptive graph selection to improve performance over static collaboration graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks use static collaboration graphs, which limit adaptability and performance. DynaSwarm aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: DynaSwarm employs an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism for stable graph optimization and a dynamic graph selector for adaptive structure choice per input sample. It also fine-tunes the demonstration retriever for in-context learning.

Result: Experiments show DynaSwarm outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines in tasks like question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding.

Conclusion: Sample-aware structural flexibility is crucial for effective LLM-based MAS designs, as demonstrated by DynaSwarm's success.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze how membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit privacy leaks in deep learning, focusing on per-sample vulnerability dynamics during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how models encode membership information during training, addressing gaps in current knowledge about privacy leakage dynamics.

Method: A dynamic analytical framework tracks per-sample vulnerabilities on an FPR-TPR plane throughout training, examining factors like dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice.

Result: A strong correlation exists between a sample's learning difficulty and its privacy risk, with highly vulnerable samples' risks determined early in training.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of privacy risk emergence during training, supporting proactive, privacy-aware model training strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network layer API for sequence modeling, enabling both layer-by-layer and step-by-step execution, with stateful layers for streaming and parallel processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the creation of sequence models that are both flexible (supporting teacher-forced training and autoregressive sampling) and robust (avoiding common bugs in streaming/parallel processing).

Method: Layers define explicit state over time (e.g., Transformer KV cache, RNN hidden state) and a step method for state evolution, ensuring consistency with stateless layer-wise invocation.

Result: Enables immediate streaming, mitigates bugs, and supports composable, declarative API for building production-scale models with correctness guarantees.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers provides a practical and efficient solution for sequence modeling, with implementations available in JAX and TensorFlow 2.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task of predicting forgotten items in supermarket visits, proposing two interpretable algorithms that outperform existing methods by 10-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Next Basket Prediction (NBP) methods focus only on future purchases, neglecting forgotten items and lacking transparency in recommendations.

Method: Two novel interpretable-by-design algorithms are proposed to identify forgotten items with clear explanations.

Result: Experiments on a real-world dataset show the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15%.

Conclusion: The study addresses a gap in NBP by introducing forgotten item prediction and interpretable solutions, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces process reward models (PRMs) to improve RL training for large reasoning models (LRMs) by providing structured, thought-level rewards, leading to faster and more efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL approaches for LRMs rely on sparse outcome-only rewards, causing inefficient training. The study aims to enhance RL training by leveraging intrinsic signals for stepwise correctness evaluation.

Method: Proposes a thought-level evaluation mechanism using intrinsic signals to judge stepwise correctness and aggregate steps into coherent 'thought' units. Introduces a capability-adaptive reward mechanism and integrates these into the TP-GRPO algorithm.

Result: Experiments show higher problem-solving accuracy with fewer training samples compared to outcome-only reward baselines.

Conclusion: Structured process rewards significantly accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks, validated by improved efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

*Qilin Zhou,Haipeng Wang,Zhengyuan Wei,W. K. Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CostCert is a scalable and precise voting-based certified recovery defender for deep learning systems, outperforming PatchGuard by avoiding pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for patch robustness certification struggle with scalability and precision in top-k predictions due to attack budget inflation and combinatorial explosion.

Method: CostCert verifies the true label within top-k predictions by checking if the attack budget is insufficient to exclude the true label, avoiding pairwise comparisons.

Result: CostCert retains up to 57.3% certified accuracy for large patch sizes, significantly outperforming PatchGuard, which drops to zero.

Conclusion: CostCert offers a novel, efficient solution for certified recovery in adversarial patch attacks, improving robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable agent-based simulation is developed for dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced inventory and faster convergence than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bike-sharing systems face imbalanced inventory due to spatiotemporally varying user demands, requiring optimal dynamic pricing to manage demand and reduce relocation costs.

Method: The paper introduces a differentiable agent-based simulation to design dynamic pricing, validated through numerical experiments with varying scales of bicycle stations and time slots.

Result: The approach reduces loss by 73-78% and increases convergence speed by over 100-fold compared to conventional methods, achieving balanced inventory without manual relocation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively minimizes relocation costs and optimizes pricing policies for large-scale bike-sharing systems, with potential cost savings through appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and explaining concept drift is essential for preventing model failures and real-world errors, requiring actionable explanations.

Method: The work extends model-based drift explanations to causal explanations, isolating causally relevant features affected by drift.

Result: The framework is evaluated on multiple use cases, showing practical utility in identifying and addressing drift impacts.

Conclusion: Causal explanations enhance the actionability of drift explanations, enabling targeted interventions in dynamic systems.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLARE introduces a novel offline RL method using vision-language models (VLMs) for preference-based training, eliminating manual reward design and achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL avoids costly online interactions but relies on reward-labeled data, which is expensive to design. PLARE addresses this by using VLMs for preference-based guidance.

Method: PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on visual trajectory segments using a language task description, then trains the policy with supervised contrastive preference learning.

Result: PLARE matches or outperforms state-of-the-art VLM-based reward methods in MetaWorld tasks and shows real-world applicability with a physical robot.

Conclusion: PLARE effectively bypasses manual reward design, offering a scalable and practical solution for offline RL in robotics.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Result: Random forest achieved 98.37% cross-validation accuracy, proving mineral content is effective for detection.

Conclusion: Mineral element profiles are reliable for honey adulteration detection, with random forest as the top-performing classifier.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting

logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for identifying adulteration in coconut milk using infrared spectroscopy and machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system for detecting adulteration in coconut
milk, utilizing infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning-based proposed
system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Motivation: To improve efficiency and flexibility in learning solution operators for time-dependent PDEs by factorizing spatial and temporal dimensions.

Method: Introduces ST-SSM, a structured state-space model that independently models temporal evolution and spatial interactions, enabling parameter efficiency and long-range dynamics.

Result: Outperforms alternatives on PDE benchmarks (e.g., Burgers', Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes) with fewer parameters and better performance under partial observability.

Conclusion: ST-SSM provides a theoretically grounded, efficient, and generalizable approach for PDE modeling, highlighting the benefits of dimensional factorization.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model (EST) predicts all-cause mortality in T2DM patients with high accuracy and interpretability using SHAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mortality risk estimation in T2DM patients is vital for personalized treatment.

Method: Analyzed 554 T2DM patients over 16.8 years, used ML models (EST performed best), and applied SHAP for interpretability.

Result: EST model achieved C-statistic 0.776 and high AUC values (0.86-0.826) for mortality prediction.

Conclusion: The model is clinically interpretable and effective for identifying high-risk T2DM patients.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

### [227] [Incorporating structural uncertainty in causal decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23495)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines when structural uncertainty in causal inference matters and proposes Bayesian model averaging as a solution, identifying key conditions for its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often ignore structural uncertainty in causal inference, which can lead to flawed decisions. This paper aims to address when and how this uncertainty should be accounted for.

Method: The study focuses on bivariate relationships (X→Y vs. X←Y) and uses Bayesian model averaging over competing causal structures. It establishes conditions for its benefit and proves optimality under regularity conditions.

Result: Model averaging is beneficial under moderate-to-high structural uncertainty, when causal effects differ between structures, and when loss functions are sensitive to effect size. Simulations show causal discovery methods can quantify this uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework addresses a typically overlooked source of uncertainty in causal inference, complementing existing robust approaches.

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEA is an adaptive ensemble aggregation method for Q-value estimates in actor-critic frameworks, improving over static rules by learning directional parameters for conservatism and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static ensemble aggregation rules in off-policy RL discard valuable information and lack adaptability to task-specific needs or learning phases.

Method: DEA introduces learnable directional parameters for critic-side conservatism and actor-side exploration, trained using ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors.

Result: DEA outperforms static ensemble strategies across continuous control benchmarks and various learning regimes.

Conclusion: DEA provides a data-driven, adaptive approach to ensemble aggregation, enhancing performance in off-policy RL.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime, proving a Verifier Trade-off Theorem and applying it to complexity class separations and natural problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between certificate length and verifier runtime, and its implications for complexity theory and practical problems.

Method: Proves a Verifier Trade-off Theorem linking verification time reduction to certificate length, and applies it to complexity classes and problems like string periodicity.

Result: Establishes a hierarchy based on certificate complexity and provides insights into separations between complexity classes (e.g., NP and EXPTIME).

Conclusion: The theorem offers a framework for analyzing complexity questions, including the P vs. NP problem, by connecting it to sub-linear certificates.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

*Saleh Vatan Khah,Savelii Chezhegov,Shahrokh Farahmand,Samuel Horváth,Eduard Gorbunov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to convex and non-convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses require increasing clipping thresholds, incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like Gaussian. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Analyzes DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level under heavy-tailed noise (bounded central α-th moment, α ∈ (1,2]).

Result: Converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution faster than existing methods, balancing convergence speed and privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The fixed clipping level enables refined trade-offs between convergence and privacy, advancing DP-compatible optimization.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CL method, Experience Blending, uses synthetic boundary data (SBD) and stored key samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines by 10-13% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of experience replay in continual learning (CL) due to sparse key samples, leading to simplified decision boundaries.

Method: Proposes Experience Blending: (1) DP noise for SBD generation, (2) joint training with stored and synthetic data.

Result: Outperforms 9 CL baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet with accuracy gains of 10%, 6%, and 13%.

Conclusion: Synthetic boundary data improves boundary stability, mitigating forgetting in CL.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks PEFT methods on convolutional architectures for edge devices, finding varied efficiency compared to LLMs and highlighting adapter-based methods' FLOPs reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored application of PEFT methods to smaller models like CNNs on edge devices, addressing computational cost challenges.

Method: Evaluates LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore on convolutional architectures using PyTorch profilers to compare performance and computational costs.

Result: PEFT methods are less memory-efficient with depthwise-separable CNNs but reduce FLOPs by up to 95% for edge-optimized architectures.

Conclusion: Provides guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware, performance, and application needs, with code available online.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

*Piotr Indyk,Michael Kapralov,Kshiteej Sheth,Tal Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a subquadratic-time algorithm for computing matrix-vector products with asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices, validated by experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fast processing of attention matrices, particularly in applications like fast attention computation in large language models (LLMs).

Method: Develops algorithms for matrix-vector products under the assumption that the sum of matrix entries scales linearly in n, not quadratically.

Result: First subquadratic-time algorithm for unrestricted vectors under the linear scaling assumption.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is efficient and experimentally validated for Gaussian kernel matrices in practical settings.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Result: SpiNNaker2 reduces energy by 32x vs. GPU, maintains latency parity, and shows real-time viability.

Conclusion: SpiNNaker2 is promising for scalable, low-energy neuromorphic RL, making it a compelling alternative to GPUs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded
deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative
advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

TL;DR: SA-FDR is a novel algorithm for feature selection using simulated annealing and Fisher discriminant ratio, achieving compact feature subsets with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting minimal yet informative feature subsets in high-dimensional settings, capturing inter-feature dependencies often missed by greedy methods.

Method: Uses simulated annealing for global search over feature subsets, guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio as a proxy for model quality.

Result: SA-FDR selects more compact feature subsets with high predictive accuracy, outperforming greedy approaches.

Conclusion: SA-FDR offers a flexible and effective solution for interpretable models in high-dimensional settings, balancing sparsity, interpretability, and performance.

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-R1 enhances multi-hop reasoning in LLMs using adaptive reinforcement learning, addressing retrieval and over-thinking issues with novel rewards and hybrid retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to rigid heuristics and underutilized LLM reasoning potential.

Method: Proposes GraphRAG-R1 with process-constrained RL (GRPO), Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) and Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) rewards, and hybrid graph-textual retrieval.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on complex reasoning tasks across datasets.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 improves LLM reasoning flexibility and performance, compatible with various retrieval methods.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EB-gMCR, a deep learning-based method for signal unmixing, automating component discovery and improving scalability for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical MCR methods struggle with scalability and require manual component count specification, which is often unknown in real data.

Method: EB-gMCR reformulates MCR as a generative process, using an energy-based deep learning solver to automatically determine the smallest component set for faithful data reconstruction.

Result: EB-gMCR achieved high accuracy (R^2 >= 0.98) and reliably estimated component counts, even with noisy data.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR provides a scalable, adaptable solution for large-scale signal unmixing, with potential applications in chemical and biological research.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method for decentralized MARL using hierarchical message-passing policies to address partial observability and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in MARL like partial observability and non-stationarity by combining coordination (message-passing) and temporal abstraction (HRL).

Method: Uses feudal HRL with a hierarchical graph structure for planning. Lower-level agents receive goals from upper levels and exchange messages. Novel reward-assignment trains lower-level policies to maximize upper-level advantages.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining hierarchical policies and message-passing in MARL is effective for scalable and coordinated multi-agent learning.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

*Tien Huu Do,Antoine Masquelier,Nae Eoun Lee,Jonathan Crowther*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method using neural networks and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to predict patient enrollment in clinical trials, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of patient enrollment is critical for clinical trial success but challenging due to financial and planning demands.

Method: Combines PLMs for document analysis with tabular features via attention, and adds a probabilistic Gamma layer for uncertainty.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in predicting patient enrollment at trial sites, validated on real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses enrollment prediction challenges, enhancing clinical trial planning.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

*Luis Roque,Carlos Soares,Vitor Cerqueira,Luis Torgo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-GTA is a transformer-based generative model for time series augmentation, improving data reliability and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation is crucial for time series tasks like forecasting and classification, but existing methods lack control and reliability.

Method: L-GTA uses a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder to apply controlled latent space transformations for generating synthetic time series.

Result: L-GTA produces more reliable and controllable augmented data, enhancing predictive accuracy and similarity measures.

Conclusion: L-GTA outperforms direct transformation methods, offering a robust solution for time series augmentation.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

### [242] [On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632)
*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why softmax attention outperforms linear attention by analyzing it as a recurrent neural network (RNN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why softmax attention is more expressive than linear attention despite its quadratic complexity.

Method: Derives the recurrent form of softmax attention and analyzes its components using RNN language.

Result: Demonstrates that softmax attention's components and interactions contribute to its superior expressiveness.

Conclusion: Softmax attention's RNN-like structure explains its effectiveness over linear approximations.

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity, compromising model integrity and privacy in medical applications.

Method: OptiGradTrust evaluates gradients via a six-dimensional fingerprint and uses a hybrid RL-attention module for trust scoring. FedBN-Prox combines Federated Batch Normalization with proximal regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving +1.6 percentage points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions and robust performance against diverse attacks.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust and FedBN-Prox provide effective solutions for secure and efficient FL in medical settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage
points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust
performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

TL;DR: A SHAP-guided regularization framework is proposed to enhance model performance and interpretability by incorporating feature importance constraints during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage feature attribution methods like SHAP for guiding model optimization, which remains underexplored.

Method: Uses entropy-based penalties to encourage sparse, stable feature attributions, applicable to regression and classification tasks, starting with TreeSHAP for tree-based models.

Result: Improves generalization performance and ensures robust, interpretable feature attributions in experiments.

Conclusion: Offers a novel, explainability-driven regularization approach for more accurate and reliable models.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

TL;DR: TweakLLM is a lightweight LLM-based routing architecture that dynamically adapts cached responses to improve efficiency and maintain response quality in high-volume LLM deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient response caching in LLMs is challenging due to personalized interactions and limited accuracy of semantic similarity search.

Method: TweakLLM uses a lightweight LLM to dynamically tweak cached responses for incoming prompts.

Result: TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness.

Conclusion: TweakLLM is a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPMD enables 1-step sampling in diffusion policies for faster RL inference without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies are slow due to iterative sampling; FPMD aims to improve responsiveness.

Method: Uses flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations, leveraging variance-discretization error theory.

Result: Matches diffusion policy performance with 100x fewer function evaluations.

Conclusion: FPMD is a faster, efficient alternative to diffusion policies in online RL.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff, a new framework combining diffusion-based modeling and a Dependency-Aware Transformer, outperforms existing methods in microbiome data imputation by leveraging metadata and capturing microbial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microbiome data analysis is hindered by sparsity and noise, and existing imputation methods fail to capture microbial interdependencies and contextual metadata.

Method: DepMicroDiff integrates diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT), uses VAE-based pretraining, and conditions on patient metadata encoded via an LLM.

Result: DepMicroDiff achieves higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE on TCGA datasets.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff is robust and generalizable, significantly improving microbiome data imputation for downstream tasks like biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using anomalous samples in few-shot settings for binary anomaly classification, proposing a multi-score method and augmentation-based validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous data is often scarce, but few-shot settings challenge the assumption that normal samples are sufficient. The study aims to leverage anomalous samples effectively.

Method: Proposes a multi-score anomaly detection method combining zero-shot and memory-based techniques, with augmentation-based validation for score aggregation.

Result: Demonstrates the utility of anomalous samples and compares them to regular samples, showing effectiveness on industrial datasets.

Conclusion: Anomalous samples can significantly improve anomaly classification in few-shot settings, with the proposed method and validation technique proving effective.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

### [249] [Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756)
*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS) for Active Learning (AL) to optimize annotator selection by considering internal factors like mood and fatigue, reducing annotation errors and improving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to minimize misclassifications in AL by addressing the gap in existing strategies that ignore internal annotator factors (e.g., mood, fatigue).

Method: A Knowledge-Based RS ranks annotators using past accuracy, mood, fatigue, and query instance details, simulating realistic annotator behavior.

Result: The approach reduces annotation errors and model uncertainty, with improved accuracy and F1-scores, though gains are modest.

Conclusion: The work pioneers integrating human cognitive factors into AL, demonstrating their impact on annotation quality and model performance.

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CODA is a method for active model selection that reduces annotation effort by 70% by prioritizing data points that differentiate the best candidate model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model selection requires costly validation datasets; CODA aims to minimize annotation effort by leveraging predictions from candidate models.

Method: CODA uses a probabilistic framework to model relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points, guiding label acquisition based on consensus and disagreement.

Result: CODA outperforms existing methods, reducing annotation effort by over 70% on 26 benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: CODA efficiently identifies the best model with minimal labeling, offering a scalable solution for model selection.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

TL;DR: SmartCourse is an AI-driven course management and advising system for CS students, integrating transcript and plan data for personalized recommendations. It outperforms traditional tools by using full context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional advising tools lack student-specific context, limiting their effectiveness. SmartCourse aims to bridge this gap by integrating transcript and plan data for personalized advice.

Method: SmartCourse combines CLI and Gradio web GUI, manages accounts, enrollment, grading, and degree plans, and uses a locally hosted LLM for recommendations. It evaluates recommendations with custom metrics like PlanScore and PersonalScore.

Result: Experiments show full-context recommendations are more relevant than context-omitted ones, proving the necessity of transcript and plan data.

Conclusion: SmartCourse demonstrates the value of transcript-aware AI in enhancing academic advising and planning.

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can

TL;DR: ELMES is an open-source framework for evaluating LLMs in education, featuring modular design and hybrid evaluation to address gaps in pedagogical assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack focus on pedagogical capabilities, and evaluation metrics vary widely in educational scenarios.

Method: ELMES uses a modular architecture for dynamic dialogues and a hybrid evaluation engine with LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.

Result: Benchmarking reveals distinct capability distributions among LLMs in four educational scenarios.

Conclusion: ELMES reduces adaptation barriers and advances LLM implementation in education, available as open-source.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at

TL;DR: A retrieval-based framework automates linking new AI failure reports to existing incidents using semantic similarity, improving scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual association of AI failure reports is inefficient; automation is needed to identify emerging patterns quickly.

Method: Proposes a ranking task using semantic similarity modeling, comparing reports to incidents via embedding cosine similarity. Evaluates lexical methods, cross-encoders, and transformer-based models.

Result: Transformer-based models perform best. Combining titles and descriptions improves accuracy. Performance remains robust across description lengths and improves with larger training sets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for maintaining the AI Incident Database (AIID).

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AutoIndexer uses workload compression and specialized RL models to scale index selection, reducing query execution time by up to 95% and outperforming state-of-the-art RL advisors by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient index selection is critical for database performance, but existing RL-based methods struggle with scaling workloads due to large action spaces and trial-and-error inefficiencies.

Method: AutoIndexer combines workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to simplify index selection while maintaining quality.

Result: AutoIndexer reduces query execution time by up to 95%, outperforms other RL advisors by 20%, and cuts tuning time by over 50%.

Conclusion: AutoIndexer is practical for large-scale workloads, offering significant performance and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise modeling of detector energy response is critical for next-gen neutrino experiments, but computational challenges arise due to lack of analytical likelihoods.

Method: Develops two neural density estimators (conditional normalizing flows and transformer-based regressor) for likelihood modeling, integrated with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference.

Result: Achieves uncertainties limited by statistics with near-zero systematic biases, offering flexibility via unbinned (normalizing flows) and binned (transformer) analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides a template for similar applications in neutrino and particle physics, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino

### [257] [A Smoothing Newton Method for Rank-one Matrix Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23017)
*Tyler Maunu,Gabriel Abreu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) for phase retrieval by revealing its connection to Newton's method and introducing a smoothing framework for stable superlinear convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the instability and limited theoretical guarantees of BWGD for rank-one matrix recovery in phase retrieval.

Method: The authors analyze BWGD as Newton's method with a nonsmooth objective and propose a smoothing framework to regularize it.

Result: Experiments show the smoothed method achieves superior stability while maintaining fast convergence.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in theory and practice for BWGD, providing stable superlinear convergence guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

### [258] [Optimal Transport Learning: Balancing Value Optimization and Fairness in Individualized Treatment Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23349)
*Wenhai Cui,Xiaoting Ji,Wen Su,Xiaodong Yan,Xingqiu Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to ensure fairness in individualized treatment rules (ITRs) using optimal transport theory, balancing value optimization and fairness with adjustable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITRs influenced by sensitive attributes can unfairly advantage/disadvantage groups, necessitating fair solutions.

Method: Uses optimal transport theory to transform ITRs into fair ones, introduces an improved trade-off ITR, and a smoothed fairness constraint for parameter adjustment.

Result: Theoretical upper bound on value loss is established; method is validated via simulations and a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances fairness and value in ITRs, with demonstrated performance in simulations and applications.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

### [259] [DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23736)
*Kyle Naddeo,Nikolas Koutsoubis,Rahul Krish,Ghulam Rasool,Nidhal Bouaynaya,Tony OSullivan,Raj Krish*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A hybrid de-identification framework combining rule-based and AI-driven techniques for secure PHI/PII removal from medical imaging data, with uncertainty quantification for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and secure sharing of medical imaging data is hindered by PHI/PII in DICOM files, necessitating robust de-identification methods.

Method: Two-tiered rule-based system, LLM for NER, and uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN for pixel data, with OCR and NER for redaction.

Result: Achieves robust performance across benchmarks (DICOM, HIPAA, TCIA) with scalable automation and quality assurance.

Conclusion: The framework enables secure, ethical release of imaging data for research by addressing de-identification challenges.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

### [260] [Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767)
*Jonathan R. Landers*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel method uses dynamic pricing distributions to identify unique signatures in the secondary ticket resale market, improving artist classification accuracy with Random Forests and implicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover distinct economic signatures in event pricing data and enhance classification accuracy in the secondary ticket resale market.

Method: Model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions, estimate parameters via quantile matching and method of moments, and integrate into Random Forest classifiers.

Result: Improved pairwise artist classification accuracy and empirical evidence of implicit regularization in Random Forests.

Conclusion: The approach effectively identifies unique pricing signatures and enhances model robustness, validated on ticket pricing and UCI ML datasets.

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

### [261] [Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768)
*Nathan Wycoff,Ali Arab,Lisa O. Singh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian approach for transfer learning when source datasets are limited and misaligned with the target dataset, improving uncertainty quantification and predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transfer learning methods struggle with limited and misaligned source datasets, lacking Bayesian formalism.

Method: Proposes a joint prior distribution for source and target parameters, using a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters, enabling Bayesian uncertainty quantification and Gibbs sampling.

Result: Demonstrates superior predictive performance, especially with limited source data, and links to minimax-frequentist techniques.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach enhances transfer learning by addressing limitations of existing methods and improving performance in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

### [262] [DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906)
*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage sensing framework for a green MIMO structure (H2AD) to estimate the number and direction of multi-emitters, achieving high accuracy and low complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high energy consumption, cost, and complexity in massive MIMO by using the H2AD architecture, while solving the open problem of intelligently sensing multi-emitters.

Method: A two-stage framework with three target number sensing methods (improved EDC, enhanced DNN, improved 1D-CNN) and a low-complexity DOA estimation method (OMC-DOA). Theoretical CRLB is derived for performance benchmarking.

Result: Simulations show 100% target sensing accuracy at moderate-to-high SNRs, with improved 1D-CNN excelling in low SNR. OMC-DOA outperforms existing DOA methods in multi-source environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the sensing challenges in H2AD MIMO, offering high accuracy and low complexity for future wireless networks.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize a framework for geosimulation platforms by examining agent-based approaches and their linkages.

Method: Comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches over two decades, focusing on principles and linkages in multi-agent systems.

Result: LLMs can be effectively integrated as agent components if they adhere to a structured architecture for fundamental agent activities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for next-generation geosimulation systems, with LLMs as viable agent components.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify
the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and
information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a
framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated
as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to
fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we
formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation

TL;DR: A federated learning framework with a quantum-enhanced LSTM model improves fraud detection by 5% and introduces 'FedRansel' for better security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rise in fraudulent digital transactions and the limitations of traditional detection methods.

Method: Combines quantum-enhanced LSTM with privacy-preserving techniques, including 'FedRansel' for attack defense.

Result: 5% performance improvement in fraud detection and 4-8% reduction in model degradation from attacks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances fraud detection accuracy and data security in financial transactions.

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent
activities, challenging traditional detection methods in the financial sector.
To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework
that uniquely combines a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
with advanced privacy preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into
the LSTM architecture, our approach adeptly captures complex
cross-transactional patters, resulting in an approximate 5% performance
improvement across key evaluation metrics compared to conventional models.
Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend
against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and
inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy
mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances
fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of
sensitive financial data.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores a neuron model's dual functional behaviors—signal propagation and generation—through parameter analysis and introduces a metric for state monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of the neuron model's dynamics and functional diversity, inspired by biological neurons' dual roles.

Method: Systematic parameter exploration, mathematical analysis, and introduction of an intermediate-state metric (on-road energy) for simulations.

Result: The model exhibits two behaviors: stable signal propagation and self-excited oscillations (signal generation), with controllable transitions and oscillation suppression.

Conclusion: The findings align with biological neurons' dual functions, providing a theoretical foundation for neuromorphic engineering applications.

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

TL;DR: LLMs can generate code for simple visualizations (e.g., bar, pie charts) and answer basic questions about them, but struggle with complex tasks like violin plots or nuanced questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capabilities of LLMs in generating visualization code and understanding common visualizations, identifying strengths and limitations.

Method: Evaluated popular LLMs by prompting them to generate visualization code and answer questions about visualizations.

Result: LLMs succeeded in simpler tasks (e.g., bar charts) but failed in complex ones (e.g., violin plots) and made errors in nuanced questions.

Conclusion: Insights can guide improvements in both LLMs and visualization systems, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cognitive Infrastructure Studies (CIS) to analyze how AI systems, as 'cognitive infrastructures,' invisibly reshape human cognition and societal reasoning, proposing new methodologies to study their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked influence of AI systems on pre-conscious human cognition and societal reasoning, bridging gaps in cognitive science, digital sociology, and computational approaches.

Method: Introduces CIS, using narrative scenarios and 'infrastructure breakdown methodologies' to reveal AI's cognitive and societal impacts.

Result: AI systems act as cognitive infrastructures, automating relevance judgments and shifting epistemic agency, reshaping cognition and social epistemologies.

Conclusion: CIS provides a framework to study AI's invisible influence, integrating interdisciplinary methods to understand its impact on distributed cognition.

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Motivation: Robots often face novel scenarios post-deployment, necessitating performance improvement without expert intervention.

Method: The system uses MLLM for interactive learning, employs a chain of questions to clarify user intent, and leverages dual-modality retrieval to learn from interactions.

Result: Experiments show quantitative and qualitative improvements in adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: The system introduces a novel approach for robotics, enhancing adaptability and user experience through interactive learning.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: RecUserSim is an LLM-based user simulator for conversational recommender systems, improving realism, diversity, and explicit ratings for better evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating CRS is challenging due to lack of realistic and diverse user simulators with explicit rating mechanisms.

Method: RecUserSim uses LLM agents with modules for user personas, memory, bounded rationality-based decision-making, and response refinement.

Result: RecUserSim produces diverse, controllable, and realistic dialogues, with consistent ratings across LLMs.

Conclusion: RecUserSim effectively addresses gaps in CRS evaluation by enhancing simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

TL;DR: An autonomous AI doctor (Doctronic) was evaluated in urgent-care telehealth, showing high diagnostic and treatment alignment with human clinicians, with AI sometimes outperforming humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global healthcare workforce shortage and reducing administrative burden by leveraging AI in clinical practice.

Method: Retrospective comparison of Doctronic (multi-agent LLM-based AI) and clinicians across 500 urgent-care telehealth cases, assessing diagnostic concordance, treatment consistency, and safety.

Result: 81% diagnostic match, 99.2% treatment alignment, no clinical hallucinations. AI outperformed humans in 36.1% of discordant cases.

Conclusion: Autonomous AI systems can match or exceed human clinicians in decision-making, offering a viable solution to healthcare shortages.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

*Ehsan Latif,Zirak Khan,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: SketchMind is a multi-agent framework for evaluating student-drawn scientific sketches, outperforming baselines with improved accuracy and human-rated feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI solutions for sketch evaluation lack interpretability and pedagogical alignment, prompting the need for a cognitively grounded approach.

Method: SketchMind uses modular agents for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback, enabling personalized evaluation.

Result: SketchMind achieved 77.1% accuracy (vs. 55.6% baseline) and human evaluators rated its feedback significantly higher (4.1/5 vs. 2.3/5).

Conclusion: SketchMind demonstrates potential for supporting conceptual growth in education through guided revision and transparent evaluation.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch

*Ismail Hossain,Mridul Banik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A hybrid EEG-BCI and LLM framework for real-time adaptive language rehabilitation in neurological conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAC systems lack real-time adaptability to users' cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological disorders like aphasia or ALS.

Method: Combines EEG-based BCIs for neural intent detection with LLMs for tailored language content, enabling mental command navigation and dynamic personalization.

Result: Proposes a system for real-time language rehabilitation, personalized exercises, and adaptive task difficulty based on cognitive effort.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework offers a promising solution for adaptive language rehabilitation in severe speech or motor impairments.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: An AI system for voice-guided stroke evaluations improves accuracy and speed but requires human oversight due to some errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inconsistent and inaccurate stroke recognition by first responders, which causes dangerous treatment delays.

Method: Voice-driven AI guides users through stroke evaluations, capturing video for expert review. Tested with non-medical volunteers on simulated cases.

Result: AI identified 84% of stroke signs, 75% of likely LVOs, and 86% of actual strokes, but had some false positives. Expert review corrected all diagnoses.

Conclusion: The AI system shows promise but needs refinement. Future advancements could enable highly accurate, human-level assessments.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

### [275] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for automatic label placement (ALP) using LLMs, supported by the MAPLE dataset, and shows promising results in aligning with cartographic standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label placement is crucial for map clarity but is often manual and hard to scale. Existing automated systems lack context-awareness and adaptability.

Method: Formulates ALP as a data editing problem, using LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to integrate labeling guidelines and generate coordinates.

Result: LLMs, guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, achieve accurate spatial edits, matching expert standards.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable AI-assisted framework for map finishing and highlights LLMs' potential in structured data editing.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

*William Huang,Xia Su,Jon E. Froehlich,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Accessibility Scout uses LLMs to provide personalized accessibility assessments of built environments from photos, balancing scalability with individual needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual accessibility assessments are labor-intensive and lack personalization, while automated methods often ignore individual user needs.

Method: Accessibility Scout leverages LLMs to analyze photos of built environments, tailoring assessments to users' mobility levels and preferences through Human-AI collaboration.

Result: The system generates personalized accessibility scans beyond traditional ADA standards, validated by technical and user studies.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of LLMs for scalable, personalized accessibility assessments and suggests future improvements.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DUET is an LLM-based tool designed to provide scalable, personalized feedback on UML and ER diagrams, addressing challenges in traditional teaching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional teaching methods struggle with providing scalable, personalized feedback for UML and ER diagrams, which require abstract thinking and contextual understanding.

Method: DUET converts reference and student diagrams into textual representations, using a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare them and generate structured feedback.

Result: Evaluated via interviews, DUET showed strengths in accessibility and scalability but faced limitations like reliability. Participants suggested improvements like bulk uploads.

Conclusion: DUET is a promising LLM-based tool for modeling education, with potential for future classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five digital literacy interventions to improve deepfake detection, finding they boost discernment by up to 13% without undermining trust in real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten trust in institutions and elections, but scalable solutions for improving detection are lacking.

Method: Compared five interventions (textual guidance, visual demonstrations, gamified exercise, implicit learning, and AI explanations) with 1,200 U.S. participants.

Result: Interventions improved deepfake detection by up to 13 percentage points while preserving trust in real images.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable, effective, and suitable for diverse populations to enhance deepfake discernment.

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended FMA framework for optimizing TCM compositions and structures, outperforming Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance and reduce costs of next-gen devices like solar cells and displays by developing novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs).

Method: Extends the FMA framework with binarization of variables, Hopfield network utilization, adaptive random flips, and bit-string local search.

Result: Achieves faster, more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms, validated on Kaggle data. Effective in multi-objective optimization for band gap and formation energy.

Conclusion: The method is promising for complex material designs and advancing materials informatics under realistic experimental conditions.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topic models are widely used but risk being treated as opaque tools; this study aims to improve their interpretability and responsible application.

Method: Analyzes 1140 BERTopic model runs to identify trade-offs in parameter optimization.

Result: Provides insights into optimizing topic model parameters and their implications.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for scrutiny and responsible use of topic models to avoid misinterpretation.

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an
accurate summary without scrutiny. This article evaluates topic models from a
database perspective, drawing insights from 1140 BERTopic model runs. The goal
is to identify trade-offs in optimizing model parameters and to reflect on what
these findings mean for the interpretation and responsible use of topic models

*Jiayu Li,Ziyi Ye,Guohao Jian,Zhiqiang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Qingyao Ai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiDu, a method to quantify a recommender's self-awareness by measuring uncertainty, showing it correlates with performance and offers insights into model states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable label-free performance estimation and informed decision-making in recommender systems by assessing their self-awareness.

Method: Proposes LiDu, a probability-based method to measure uncertainty in ranking lists derived from item prediction distributions.

Result: LiDu correlates better with performance than other label-free estimators and provides insights into model states during training and inference.

Conclusion: LiDu connects recommendation uncertainty to performance, advancing transparent and self-evaluating recommender systems.

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

*Wei-Wei Du,Takuma Udagawa,Kei Tateno*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IntervalLLM integrates dynamic time intervals into sequential recommendation tasks, improving performance by 4.4% and addressing cold-start scenarios from a novel interval perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook dynamic time intervals between purchases, which are crucial for user profiling and recommendation accuracy.

Method: Proposes IntervalLLM, a framework with interval-infused attention to jointly model items and intervals, and introduces interval-based evaluation for warm/cold scenarios.

Result: Achieves 4.4% average improvement and best performance in warm/cold scenarios, with interval-based cold challenges showing the most significant performance drop.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of interval information in sequential recommendations and calls for further research on interval-based cold challenges.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

*Fan Li,Chang Meng,Jiaqi Fu,Shuchang Liu,Jiashuo Zhang,Tianke Zhang,Xueliang Wang,Xiaoqiang Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) to optimize page navigation in multi-page platforms, proposing KLAN, a hierarchical framework, which improves user engagement metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on in-page interactions, neglecting page navigation. The paper aims to address this gap by optimizing landing page selection for better user engagement.

Method: Proposes KLAN, a framework with three components: KLAN-ISP (static preferences), KLAN-IIT (dynamic interest transitions), and KLAN-AM (adaptive integration).

Result: KLAN improves Daily Active Users (DAU) by +0.205% and user Lifetime (LT) by +0.192%, deployed at full traffic on Kuaishou.

Conclusion: KLAN effectively addresses PLPM, enhancing user engagement. The dataset and code will be released for further research.

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to generate smart contract code from business process descriptions, introducing an automated evaluation framework to test LLM performance on larger datasets. Results show LLMs fall short of perfect reliability for smart contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional rule-based code generation by leveraging LLMs for smart contract code generation from business process descriptions.

Method: An exploratory study using an automated evaluation framework to test LLMs of different types and sizes on larger datasets of process models, assessing properties like process flow, resource allocation, and data-based conditions.

Result: LLM performance is insufficient for perfect reliability in smart contract development, highlighting gaps in execution correctness.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on responsible LLM integrations in code generation tools, with the proposed framework serving as a foundation for evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate introduces a competitive multi-agent debate framework to improve issue resolution in software engineering by encouraging diverse reasoning paths and consolidated fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent-based issue resolution methods often get stuck in local solutions and miss broader issue patterns.

Method: SWE-Debate creates fault propagation traces, organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, and integrates the consolidated fix plan into an MCTS-based code modification agent.

Result: SWE-Debate achieves state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench benchmark, outperforming baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The framework enhances issue localization and resolution by leveraging competitive multi-agent debates.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp enhances LLM agents by distilling reusable experience from past repairs, improving issue resolution rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack memory, leading to redundant exploration and missed opportunities to reuse successful repair methods.

Method: SWE-Exp introduces a multi-faceted experience bank capturing successful and failed repair attempts at various levels.

Result: Achieves 41.6% Pass@1 resolution rate on SWE-bench-Verified, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp shifts software engineering agents from trial-and-error to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

### [287] [AutoBridge: Automating Smart Device Integration with Centralized Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23178)
*Siyuan Liu,Zhice Yang,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge automates IoT integration code generation, reducing human effort by using a divide-and-conquer strategy and multi-stage debugging, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual IoT integration is complex and requires expertise; automating this process can save time and effort.

Method: AutoBridge uses a divide-and-conquer approach: generating device control logic and synthesizing platform-compliant code, with multi-stage debugging for correctness.

Result: Achieves 93.87% success rate and 94.87% function coverage without human input; reaches 100% with minimal feedback.

Conclusion: AutoBridge significantly outperforms human experts, even with LLM assistance, demonstrating its effectiveness in IoT integration.

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper advocates for eXplainable Autonomous Business Processes (XABPs) to address concerns like trust, accountability, and bias in AI-driven workflows, proposing a systematic approach to their design and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABPs improve efficiency but raise issues like trust, accountability, and compliance, necessitating explainability (XABPs) to mitigate these concerns.

Method: The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, detailing their forms, explainability structures, and key BPM research challenges.

Result: XABPs are proposed as a solution to enhance transparency and trust in autonomous workflows.

Conclusion: The paper identifies key challenges and a framework for implementing XABPs to balance efficiency with accountability and compliance.

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of

agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to

*Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Jiru Xu,Roger D. Soberanis Mukul,Hao Ding,Grayson Byrd,Yu-Chun Ku,Jose L. Porras,Masaru Ishii,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Perception Agent for natural human-machine interaction in surgery, using LLMs, SAM, and tracking models to segment known and unseen elements, outperforming rigid AI solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven surgical solutions are rigid and limit natural interaction. The work aims to enhance flexibility and intuitiveness in human-machine interfaces for real-time surgical assistance.

Method: The Perception Agent integrates speech-prompted LLMs, SAM, and tracking models, with a memory repository and novel segmentation mechanisms for unseen elements.

Result: Quantitative analysis shows performance comparable to manual-prompting, while qualitative tests demonstrate flexibility in segmenting novel elements like instruments and gauze.

Conclusion: The Perception Agent advances human-machine symbiosis in surgery, offering adaptable and intuitive real-time assistance.

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

TL;DR: A closed-loop visuomotor controller for robotic pruning is introduced, trained in simulation and tested in real-world orchards with moderate success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive, necessitating automation for efficiency in modern orchards.

Method: The controller uses optical flow images from a wrist-mounted camera, avoiding full 3D reconstruction, and is trained in a simulated orchard environment.

Result: Achieved a 30% success rate in real-world deployment, half the performance of an oracle planner.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for robotic pruning but requires improvement to match human or oracle performance.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

TL;DR: The paper presents an integrated navigation framework for autonomous robots in agriculture, combining DTSP for global path planning and NMPC for local control, achieving smoother and shorter paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient navigation in unstructured agricultural environments, minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to protect soil and vegetation.

Method: Combines a global path planner (DTSP) for curvature-constrained path generation with a local NMPC controller for accurate waypoint tracking and trajectory optimization.

Result: Simulations showed a 16% reduction in path length and smoother trajectories compared to decoupled methods, with NMPC ensuring constraint adherence.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for efficient autonomous navigation in agriculture, balancing global and local planning effectively.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: H-RDT leverages human manipulation data to improve robot learning, outperforming existing methods by 13.9% (simulation) and 40.5% (real-world).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of large-scale robot demonstration data and challenges in cross-embodiment training motivate the use of human data for robotic manipulation.

Method: Two-stage training: pre-training on human manipulation data, then fine-tuning on robot-specific data using a diffusion transformer with flow matching.

Result: H-RDT achieves significant improvements over baseline methods, validating human data as a foundation for robotic policies.

Conclusion: Human manipulation data effectively enhances robotic learning, demonstrated by H-RDT's superior performance.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSFusion is a LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system addressing 3DGS challenges like sparse data and alignment, improving rendering quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of camera-based 3DGS (computational load, poor texture/illumination, short range) and LiDAR integration challenges (alignment, optimization time).

Method: Uses surfel-to-surfel constraint for global pose-graph optimization, pixel-aware Gaussian initialization, and bounded sigmoid constraint.

Result: Outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Conclusion: GSFusion effectively integrates LiDAR with 3DGS, improving performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Motivation: To enhance the generalization of robot manipulation policies by improving latent action representation and integration into VLA pre-training.

Method: Proposes ViLLA-X, a framework that refines latent action learning and its incorporation into VLA models.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in simulated environments (SIMPLER, LIBERO) and real-world setups (gripper, dexterous hand manipulation).

Conclusion: ViLLA-X establishes a strong foundation for future research in latent action modeling for robot manipulation.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Result: Superior performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning in urban intersection scenarios with construction zones.

Conclusion: Language-augmented cognitive frameworks like PLA can improve safety, interpretability, and scalability in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating structured and executable robotic task plans, given their strong generative capabilities but uncertain effectiveness in planning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLMs prompted with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) files, comparing their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across benchmarks. Success rates and plan executability were measured.

Result: LLMs perform well on simpler tasks but struggle with complex scenarios requiring precise resource management, state tracking, and constraint compliance.

Conclusion: The study identifies gaps in LLM-based planning and suggests integrating LLMs with classical planners to improve reliability and scalability in autonomous robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate UX assessment in HRI is needed for adaptive robot behaviors, but existing methods focus on isolated aspects like sentiment or engagement.

Method: Constructs a UX dataset and develops a Transformer-based model with multi-instance learning to capture short- and long-term interaction patterns.

Result: Outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation by providing a holistic representation of temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more comprehensive UX estimation for HRI, enhancing adaptability in social robots.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

Motivation: Overcoming RL's tendency to overfit specific tasks and environments to enable generalizable behaviors in diverse settings.

Method: Cross-view goal specification for unified multi-task RL and automated task synthesis in Minecraft, supported by a distributed RL framework.

Result: RL boosts interaction success rates by 4× and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial reasoning across diverse environments.

Conclusion: RL training in customizable 3D environments like Minecraft holds significant potential for advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated

### [302] [On the Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Nonconvex Simple Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23155)
*Jincheng Cao,Ruichen Jiang,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a first-order algorithm for solving nonconvex bilevel optimization problems, focusing on stationarity rather than global optimality. It achieves polynomial-time complexity for joint stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization problems are challenging, especially without convexity or PL conditions. The paper aims to address this by defining a practical notion of stationarity and designing an efficient algorithm.

Method: A variant of dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) is proposed to find stationary points for nonconvex bilevel problems, with a focus on joint upper- and lower-level stationarity.

Result: The algorithm achieves a complexity of O(max(ε_f^(-(3+p)/(1+p)), ε_g^(-(3+p)/2))), ensuring joint stationarity for both levels in polynomial time.

Conclusion: This is the first work to provide a complexity guarantee for joint stationarity in general nonconvex bilevel problems, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information bottleneck asset pricing model to address overfitting in DNNs for financial data by compressing low signal-to-noise data and retaining critical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs in financial asset pricing often overfit to noise, leading to poor performance. The goal is to filter out noise while preserving essential information.

Method: The model uses mutual information constraints to compress data, reducing irrelevant input information while enhancing relevant output prediction information.

Result: The model effectively filters noise and retains critical financial data relationships, improving asset pricing accuracy.

Conclusion: The information bottleneck approach enhances DNN performance in financial asset pricing by balancing noise reduction and information retention.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

### [304] [Adjoint-Based Aerodynamic Shape Optimization with a Manifold Constraint Learned by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23443)
*Long Chen,Emre Oezkaya,Jan Rottmayer,Nicolas R. Gauger,Zebang Shen,Yinyu Ye*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: An adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework integrates a diffusion model to learn viable shapes, enforcing it as a constraint. It computes adjoint gradients via automatic differentiation, achieving superior performance without ad hoc tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance aerodynamic shape optimization by integrating AI-generated priors (diffusion models) with adjoint methods for robustness and performance.

Method: Uses a diffusion model trained on existing designs to create a smooth manifold of viable shapes. Computes adjoint gradients via automatic differentiation, backpropagating through the model.

Result: Eliminates ad hoc tuning, maintains robustness, and outperforms conventional methods in transonic RANS airfoil design.

Conclusion: AI-generated priors effectively integrate with adjoint methods, enabling robust, high-fidelity aerodynamic optimization.

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

*Lijia Liu,Takumi Kondo,Kyohei Atarashi,Koh Takeuchi,Jiyi Li,Shigeru Saito,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SE+CFE, a framework combining Standard Evaluation (SE) and Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE) to detect blind prompt injection attacks in LLM-based evaluation systems, improving security with minimal trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To defend LLM-based evaluation systems against blind prompt injection attacks, where deceptive answers are crafted independently of the true answer.

Method: Augments SE with CFE, re-evaluating submissions against false ground-truth answers to detect attacks if validated under both conditions.

Result: SE+CFE significantly improves attack detection compared to standard evaluation, which is highly vulnerable.

Conclusion: The SE+CFE framework effectively counters blind attacks with minimal performance impact, enhancing LLM evaluation security.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

### [306] [LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611)
*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based method to analyze infection screenshots for IoCs, infection vectors, and malware campaigns, demonstrating its effectiveness with the Aurora infostealer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of infostealer logs is impractical at scale, and current research overlooks infection artifacts like screenshots.

Method: Uses gpt-4o-mini to analyze screenshots for IoCs, infection vectors, and campaign tracking.

Result: Extracted 337 URLs and 246 files from 1000 screenshots, identifying three malware campaigns.

Conclusion: LLM-driven analysis of screenshots offers a scalable, reactive approach for threat intelligence and early intervention.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

### [307] [LLMs Between the Nodes: Community Discovery Beyond Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22955)
*Ekta Gujral,Apurva Sinha*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs like GPT-4o for community detection in social networks, introducing CommLLM, a two-step framework that combines semantic and structural data. Evaluations on real-world datasets show improved accuracy with graph-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional community detection methods rely on graph structure alone, missing semantic context. LLMs offer a way to integrate language understanding, enhancing detection quality.

Method: CommLLM, a two-step framework using GPT-4o and prompt-based reasoning, merges LLM outputs with graph structure. Evaluated on six datasets with metrics like NMI, ARI, VOI, and cluster purity.

Result: LLMs, especially with graph-aware strategies, perform well in small to medium-sized graphs. Instruction-tuned models and engineered prompts boost accuracy and coherence.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for community detection when tailored to graph data, emphasizing the need for structured model interactions.

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The author reflects on creating two AI-generated music albums, exploring authorship, identity, and AI's role in music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the creative and philosophical implications of using AI for music generation, questioning authorship and personal identity in AI-assisted art.

Method: Created two albums using prompt-based AI platforms, one experimenting with unconventional inputs (junk mail) and the other challenging AI's polished output. Used an LLM to interview the author about the process.

Result: Raised deeper questions about authorship, personal identity in AI-generated art, and the evolving role of human creativity alongside AI.

Conclusion: Reflects on the process and suggests LLM-mediated self-reflection as a valuable method for exploring AI's impact on artistic identity.

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

### [309] [Noise-Coded Illumination for Forensic and Photometric Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23002)
*Peter F. Michael,Zekun Hao,Serge Belongie,Abe Davis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to combat fake videos by embedding subtle, noise-like modulations in scene illumination, creating a temporal watermark that aids verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of advanced video manipulation tools has made fake videos harder to detect, favoring malicious actors. The paper aims to create an information asymmetry to favor verification.

Method: The approach involves coding subtle modulations into scene illumination, creating a temporal watermark that encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene.

Result: The method makes it harder for adversaries to create plausible fake videos, even if they know the technique is being used.

Conclusion: This technique is promising for protecting high-stakes settings where video manipulation is likely and illumination can be controlled.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

*Dian Chen,Yansong Qu,Xinyang Li,Ming Li,Shengchuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: XSpecMesh accelerates auto-regressive mesh generation by using speculative decoding and distillation, achieving 1.7x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-regressive models for mesh generation are slow due to sequential token predictions.

Method: Uses lightweight multi-head speculative decoding for parallel token prediction, verification, resampling, and distillation to align predictions.

Result: Achieves 1.7x speedup while preserving mesh quality.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh effectively reduces latency in mesh generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces polar parameters for Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) to enhance ASR by capturing speech dynamics and reducing spectral variation. Combined with MFCCs, these parameters improve Vietnamese ASR performance, showing lower word error rates and better gender independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ASR performance by capturing dynamic speech characteristics and minimizing spectral variation, especially for tonal languages like Vietnamese.

Method: Characterized acoustic transitions in SSCFs using polar parameters, combined them with MFCCs, and used SSCF0 as a pseudo-feature for F0 to robustly describe tonal information.

Result: The proposed parameters significantly reduced word error rates and demonstrated greater gender independence compared to baseline MFCCs.

Conclusion: The SSCF-based polar parameters combined with MFCCs enhance ASR performance, particularly for tonal languages, by better capturing dynamic speech characteristics.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: MECAT is a benchmark for fine-grained audio understanding, created using expert models and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and evaluated with a novel metric, DATE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack the ability to distinguish between generic and detailed audio model outputs, limiting nuanced comprehension.

Method: MECAT integrates expert model analysis and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate fine-grained captions and QA pairs, evaluated using DATE.

Result: The benchmark and DATE metric provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art audio models.

Conclusion: MECAT and DATE advance audio understanding by enabling more detailed and discriminative evaluation.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a multi-center 3D MRI dataset for pancreas segmentation, addressing cross-center and cross-sequence domain shifts, and proposes a semi-supervised method outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook variability in MR sequences, and pancreas segmentation is challenging due to low contrast and under-representation in datasets, despite its clinical importance.

Method: A large-scale dataset (563 MRI scans from six institutions) with pixel-accurate masks is created. A semi-supervised approach leverages anatomical invariances.

Result: The method achieves 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on test centers, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging, highlighting the need for specialized solutions for cross-sequence shifts.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data fusion and downstream applications caused by resolution differences across satellite sensors.

Method: Develop a framework using HLS10 as reference to align and harmonize HLS30 imagery, bridging resolution gaps.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the method's effectiveness in enhancing super-resolved Landsat imagery.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility for heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and suggests future advancements.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited datasets for skin disease classification due to privacy, cost, and demographic gaps; T2I-DPMs are promising but underexplored in dermatology.

Method: LesionGen uses structured, concept-rich captions from expert annotations and pseudo-reports to fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for image synthesis.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data match real-image performance, with improved worst-case subgroup accuracy.

Conclusion: LesionGen effectively addresses dataset limitations in dermatology, enabling high-quality synthetic data for training.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

*Yang Ren,Hai Jiang,Wei Li,Menglong Yang,Heng Zhang,Zehua Sheng,Qingsheng Ye,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based framework for RAW image downscaling, preserving details and avoiding artifacts, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sRGB downscaling methods blur details and introduce artifacts; RAW images lack specialized frameworks.

Method: Uses wavelet transformation with LASDM and HFPM modules, plus an energy-maximization loss, for coarse-to-fine downscaling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively downscales RAW images, preserving structural and textural integrity.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Method: EMedNeXt builds on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision, optimized post-processing, a larger ROI, improved nnU-Net v2 architecture, and robust ensembling.

Result: Achieved LesionWise DSC of 0.897 and NSD of 0.541 (0.5mm) and 0.84 (1.0mm) on validation.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt offers a viable solution for accurate glioma segmentation in resource-limited settings like sub-Saharan Africa.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

*Huayu Fu,Jiamin Li,Haozhi Qu,Xiaolin Hu,Zengcai Guo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An improved framework for automatic segmentation of neuronal topology using deep learning, addressing challenges like occlusions and proposing a novel evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling large-scale neuroimaging data requires efficient neuron annotation and analysis, but intricate neuronal morphology and occlusions complicate deep learning-based segmentation.

Method: Proposes a deep network for pixel-level embedding vectors with a tailored loss function, an end-to-end pipeline for SWC-formatted neuron trees, and a novel topological evaluation metric.

Result: Significantly reduces error rates in neuronal topology reconstruction compared to classical methods, as demonstrated on an fMOST imaging dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses segmentation challenges and improves accuracy in neuronal topology reconstruction, validated by a new evaluation metric.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

*Oliver Bause,Julia Werner,Paul Palomero Bernardo,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN with 63,000 parameters achieves 93.06% accuracy on Bayer images for Video Capsule Endoscopy, saving 89.9% energy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are unsuitable for low-power sensor edge devices due to large model sizes and high computational demands. Bayer-to-RGB conversion is energy-intensive, and skipping it could save energy.

Method: Uses a CNN with 63,000 parameters and Viterbi decoding for time-series analysis, evaluated directly on Bayer images. Implemented on a PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a RISC-V core and hardware accelerator.

Result: Achieves 93.06% accuracy on Bayer images, requires only 5.31 µJ per image, and saves 89.9% energy compared to classic video capsules.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables energy-efficient AI-based image classification for resource-constrained devices, particularly beneficial for medical applications like Video Capsule Endoscopy.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: JPNeO is a backward-compatible JPEG algorithm using neural operators to improve chroma preservation and reconstruction fidelity, with reduced memory usage and parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardizing learning-based lossy compression while maintaining backward compatibility with JPEG is challenging.

Method: Incorporates neural operators in encoding and decoding stages to enhance performance.

Result: Improved chroma preservation, reconstruction fidelity, and reduced resource usage.

Conclusion: JPNeO offers a high-performance, out-of-the-box image compression solution without altering source coding protocols.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores continual learning (CL) to improve malaria CAD models' robustness against domain shifts, testing four CL strategies on multi-site data. Rehearsal-based methods show significant improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria diagnosis in low-resource settings lacks expert microscopy, and existing CAD systems struggle with generalization across varying conditions.

Method: The study frames the problem as domain-incremental learning, using a YOLO-based detector and evaluating four CL strategies (two rehearsal-based, two regularization-based) on multi-site clinical data.

Result: Rehearsal-based CL methods notably enhance model performance, demonstrating adaptability to new sites while retaining prior domain knowledge.

Conclusion: Continual learning, especially rehearsal-based approaches, holds promise for developing deployable malaria CAD tools by improving robustness to domain shifts.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

*Liu Li,Qiang Ma,Cheng Ouyang,Johannes C. Paetzold,Daniel Rueckert,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel topology-aware segmentation method using Euler Characteristic (χ) improves topological correctness in medical images while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional metrics like Dice score often fail to ensure clinically acceptable topological accuracy in medical image segmentation, especially for constraints like continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.

Method: Proposes a fast χ computation for 2D/3D data, uses χ error as a topological metric, identifies violations via a topological violation map, and refines results with a correction network.

Result: Experiments on 2D/3D datasets show significant improvement in topological correctness without compromising pixel-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses topological constraints in segmentation, offering a practical solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

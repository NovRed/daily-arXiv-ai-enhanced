To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it.

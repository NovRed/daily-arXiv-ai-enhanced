### [1] [3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996)
*Lingdong Kong,Wesley Yang,Jianbiao Mei,Youquan Liu,Ao Liang,Dekai Zhu,Dongyue Lu,Wei Yin,Xiaotao Hu,Mingkai Jia,Junyuan Deng,Kaiwen Zhang,Yang Wu,Tianyi Yan,Shenyuan Gao,Song Wang,Linfeng Li,Liang Pan,Yong Liu,Jianke Zhu,Wei Tsang Ooi,Steven C. H. Hoi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive survey of 3D/4D world modeling, establishing definitions, taxonomy (VideoGen, OccGen, LiDARGen), and systematic evaluation for advancing the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmentation in world modeling research due to lack of standardized definitions and taxonomy, and bridge the gap between 2D-focused generative methods and emerging 3D/4D representations.

Method: Systematic literature review establishing precise definitions, structured taxonomy spanning video-based, occupancy-based, and LiDAR-based approaches, with comprehensive dataset and metric analysis.

Result: Provides coherent foundational reference with standardized framework, taxonomy, and systematic summary of 3D/4D world modeling literature and evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational groundwork for advancing 3D/4D world modeling, identifies open challenges, and highlights promising research directions for the field.

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

*Shahid Shafi Dar,Bharat Kaurav,Arnav Jain,Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet is a novel deep learning framework for urban flood classification that integrates hierarchical cross-modal attention, heterogeneous convolutional attention, and cascading transformer feature refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple flood datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood detection methods rely on unimodal data and static rule-based systems that fail to capture dynamic, non-linear flood relationships. Existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches have limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal integration, and adaptability to noisy environments.

Method: XFloodNet integrates three novel components: 1) Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention for dynamic visual-textual feature alignment, 2) Heterogeneous Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention with frequency-enhanced channel and spatial attention, and 3) Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature Refinement for hierarchical feature harmonization.

Result: XFloodNet achieves state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33% on Chennai Floods, 82.24% on Rhine18 Floods, and 88.60% on Harz17 Floods, significantly surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: XFloodNet redefines urban flood classification through advanced deep learning techniques, providing robust and noise-resistant flood detection that addresses the limitations of traditional methods and existing attention mechanisms.

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)
*Hyungjin Chung,Hyelin Nam,Jiyeon Kim,Hyojun Go,Byeongjun Park,Junho Kim,Joonseok Lee,Seongsu Ha,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) enables VideoLLMs to process more frames without increasing context window by running parallel inference streams on disjoint frame subsets and aggregating outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs face computational bottlenecks when increasing input frames for temporal detail, leading to prohibitive costs and performance degradation from long context lengths.

Method: VPS runs multiple parallel inference streams, each processing unique disjoint subsets of video frames, then aggregates output probabilities to integrate richer visual information without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments across 2B-32B models on benchmarks like Video-MME and EventHallusion show VPS consistently and significantly improves performance, scaling better than alternatives like Self-consistency.

Conclusion: VPS provides a memory-efficient and robust framework that effectively contracts the Chinchilla scaling law, enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities of VideoLLMs without increasing computational burden.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

### [4] [Two Stage Context Learning with Large Language Models for Multimodal Stance Detection on Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08024)
*Lata Pangtey,Omkar Kabde,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal stance detection framework combining text and visual information through hierarchical fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on climate change stance detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in existing stance detection approaches that focus only on textual data, while real-world social media increasingly combines text with visual elements.

Method: Uses LLM for stance-relevant text summaries, domain-aware image caption generator for visual content interpretation, and specialized transformer module for joint modeling of text-image interactions.

Result: Achieved 76.2% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on MultiClimate dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively integrates textual and visual information for robust stance classification, demonstrating superior performance over text-only methods.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

transfer learning model for detecting multiple vehicles in UAV images. It
combines three pre-trained Faster R-CNN feature extractor models (InceptionV3,
ResNet50, GoogLeNet) with five transfer classifiers (KNN, SVM, MLP, C4.5,
Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

### [6] [MCTED: A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset for Digital Elevation Model Generation From Mars Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08027)
*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New MCTED dataset for Martian DEM prediction with 80,898 samples from CTX instrument data, featuring optical image patches, DEM patches, and masks for missing/altered data. Small U-Net trained on this dataset outperforms zero-shot DepthAnythingV2 foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Martian DEMs often contain artefacts and missing data points due to complex processing pipelines, creating a need for high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets for Martian surface elevation modeling.

Method: Created comprehensive pipeline to process high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from CTX instrument data. Developed tools to mitigate artefacts and missing data. Divided data into training/validation splits without mutual area coverage. Trained small U-Net architecture on the dataset.

Result: Generated MCTED dataset with 80,898 samples covering diverse Martian surface. Small U-Net trained on MCTED outperformed zero-shot performance of DepthAnythingV2 foundation model for elevation prediction.

Conclusion: Specialized datasets like MCTED enable better Martian DEM prediction than general-purpose foundation models, demonstrating the value of domain-specific data collection and processing for planetary science applications.

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APML is a differentiable one-to-one matching loss for point cloud prediction that overcomes limitations of Chamfer-based losses and EMD, offering near-quadratic runtime and improved performance without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud loss functions like Chamfer Distance suffer from many-to-one correspondences causing point congestion and poor coverage, while Earth Mover Distance has prohibitive cubic complexity.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML) using Sinkhorn iterations on temperature-scaled similarity matrix with analytically computed temperature to guarantee minimum assignment probability.

Result: APML achieves faster convergence, superior spatial distribution (especially in low-density regions), and improved quantitative performance on ShapeNet benchmarks and WiFi-based 3D human point cloud generation.

Conclusion: APML provides an efficient, differentiable alternative to existing point cloud losses with better structural preservation and practical runtime, eliminating manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

### [8] [Lightweight Deep Unfolding Networks with Enhanced Robustness for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08205)
*Jingjing Liu,Yinchao Han,Xianchao Xiu,Jianhua Zhang,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-RPCANet is a lightweight infrared small target detection framework that improves parameter efficiency and noise robustness through hierarchical bottleneck structures, noise reduction modules, and channel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks for infrared small target detection face challenges in parameter lightweightness and noise robustness, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Proposes L-RPCANet based on robust principal component analysis, featuring hierarchical bottleneck structure for channel-wise feature refinement, noise reduction module for robustness, and squeeze-and-excitation networks for channel attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on ISTD datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods including RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++.

Conclusion: The proposed L-RPCANet achieves excellent performance while maintaining both lightweight parameter design and robustness against complex noise in infrared small target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) strategy for video compressive imaging reduces power consumption by using only one sub-frame per spatial location, enabling 10-100X power reduction with higher dynamic range than random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital cameras consume unsustainable power (~20W for 4K at 30fps), making gigapixel cameras at 100-1000fps impractical. Compressive measurement can reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X.

Method: Proposes USS regime where only one sub-frame is set to 1 per spatial location. Built DMD encoding system and developed BSTFormer - a sparse Transformer with local block attention, global sparse attention, and temporal attention to handle measurement mismatch.

Result: Extensive results on simulated and real-world data show significant outperformance over all previous state-of-the-art algorithms. USS strategy provides higher dynamic range than random sampling and enables fixed exposure time for on-chip implementation.

Conclusion: USS strategy is an effective approach for video compressive imaging that reduces power consumption while maintaining performance, with advantages in dynamic range and suitability for on-chip implementation.

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

### [10] [GTA-Crime: A Synthetic Dataset and Generation Framework for Fatal Violence Detection with Adversarial Snippet-Level Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08232)
*Seongho Kim,Sejong Ryu,Hyoukjun You,Je Hyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTA-Crime dataset and framework for fatal video anomaly detection using GTA5, with domain adaptation to improve real-world violence detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video anomaly detection struggles with rare fatal incidents like shootings and stabbings due to data scarcity and ethical collection issues.

Method: Created synthetic dataset using GTA5 with fatal scenarios, multi-view CCTV perspectives, and diverse conditions. Proposed snippet-level domain adaptation with Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge synthetic-real feature gap.

Result: Experimental validation shows GTA-Crime dataset enhances real-world fatal violence detection accuracy when combined with domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: GTA-Crime provides ethical synthetic data solution for rare fatal incidents, with domain adaptation effectively transferring synthetic learning to real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at
https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.

### [11] [RepViT-CXR: A Channel Replication Strategy for Vision Transformers in Chest X-ray Tuberculosis and Pneumonia Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08234)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepViT-CXR uses channel replication to adapt single-channel chest X-rays for Vision Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on TB and pneumonia detection across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers are typically pretrained on 3-channel natural images but chest X-rays are grayscale (single-channel), creating an incompatibility that hinders their application to medical imaging tasks.

Method: Proposed RepViT-CXR with channel replication strategy that converts single-channel CXR images into ViT-compatible format without information loss, evaluated on three benchmark datasets.

Result: Achieved 99.9% accuracy/AUC on TB-CXR, 99.0% accuracy on Pediatric Pneumonia, and 91.1% accuracy on Shenzhen TB dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Simple channel replication enables ViTs to effectively leverage their power on grayscale medical images, establishing new SOTA for TB/pneumonia detection with strong clinical deployment potential.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

### [12] [Symmetry Interactive Transformer with CNN Framework for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Structural MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08243)
*Zheng Yang,Yanteng Zhang,Xupeng Kou,Yang Liu,Chao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel end-to-end network combining 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, focusing on brain asymmetry caused by atrophy to achieve 92.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either rely on pretraining or ignore the asymmetrical characteristics caused by brain disorders in Alzheimer's disease, limiting diagnostic performance.

Method: Proposed network with 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive Transformer (SIT) that aligns left and right hemisphere features using inter-equal grid block fetch operation to focus on asymmetric regions caused by structural changes.

Result: Achieved 92.5% diagnostic accuracy on ADNI dataset, outperforming several CNN methods and CNN-transformer combinations. Visualization shows better focus on brain atrophy regions and asymmetric pathological characteristics.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures asymmetric brain changes in AD, demonstrating improved diagnostic performance and interpretability through attention to atrophy regions.

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.

*Chi Zhang,Xiang Zhang,Chenxu Jiang,Gui-Song Xia,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVDI++ is a self-supervised framework that uses event cameras to deblur videos and interpolate frames, achieving state-of-the-art results through learnable double integration and adaptive fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frame-based cameras with long exposure times cause visual blurring and information loss between frames, degrading video quality. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but need effective integration methods.

Method: Uses Learnable Double Integral (LDI) network to map reference frames to sharp images, learning-based division reconstruction for varying exposures, and parameter-free fusion strategy using event confidence. Self-supervised training with real-world blurry videos and events.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets for video deblurring and interpolation tasks. Demonstrates generalizability with real-world data captured using DAVIS346c camera.

Conclusion: EVDI++ effectively leverages event camera data to solve motion blur and frame interpolation problems through a unified self-supervised framework that works well in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

*Long Gao,Yunhe Zhang,Yan Jiang,Weiying Xie,Yunsong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyMamba is a new hyperspectral object tracking network that uses state space modules to unify spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperspectral trackers fail to capture intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions, limiting their effectiveness in challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes HyMamba with Spectral State Integration (SSI) module and Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module that uses three directional scanning state space modules to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously, constructing joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs.

Result: Achieves 73.0% AUC score and 96.3% DP@20 score on HOTC2020 dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HyMamba effectively addresses limitations of existing hyperspectral trackers by unifying spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules, providing superior object tracking performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

*Saurav Sengupta,Nazanin Moradinasab,Jiebei Liu,Donald E. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs rely on training biases and fail on specific visual questions. Minor image/prompt changes cause large performance variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often disregard visual evidence when answering specific questions about images, relying instead on inherent biases learned during training. This research aims to systematically understand which input characteristics cause these performance differences.

Method: Developed a multi-dimensional examination framework using open-source VLMs. Analyzed how attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters including image size, number of objects, background color, and prompt specificity.

Result: Even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt specificity lead to large changes in how VLMs formulate answers and their overall performance. VLMs particularly struggle with highly specific questions requiring focus on particular image areas.

Conclusion: Vision Language Models are highly sensitive to input variations, and their performance can be significantly impacted by subtle changes in both visual and textual inputs. This highlights the need for better understanding and characterization of VLM behavior under different input conditions.

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

*Hyeonseok Kim,Byeongkeun Kang,Yeejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E3DPC-GZSL is a novel method for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation that addresses biased predictions in generalized zero-shot learning by integrating evidence-based uncertainty estimation and dynamic calibration to reduce overconfidence towards seen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D point cloud segmentation models tend to make biased predictions favoring seen classes due to smaller training data scales compared to image-based tasks, requiring better handling of unseen classes in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: Integrates evidence-based uncertainty estimator into classifier, uses dynamic calibrated stacking factor to adjust prediction probabilities based on pointwise uncertainty, and employs novel training strategy merging learnable parameters with text-derived features to refine semantic space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets including ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Conclusion: The proposed E3DPC-GZSL effectively reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes and improves uncertainty estimation, demonstrating superior performance in 3D point cloud zero-shot segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

### [17] [Dual-Thresholding Heatmaps to Cluster Proposals for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08289)
*Yuelin Guo,Haoyu He,Zhiyuan Chen,Zitong Huang,Renhao Lu,Lu Shi,Zejun Wang,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised object detection framework that addresses three key limitations in existing methods through heatmap-guided proposal selection, enhanced detection network architecture, and improved optimization with negative supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSOD methods suffer from three main problems: 1) pseudo GT boxes either focus only on discriminative parts or fail to distinguish adjacent instances, 2) WSDDN lacks background class representation and has semantic gaps between branches, 3) discarded proposals slow convergence.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Heatmap-Guided Proposal Selector (HGPS) with dual thresholds for better proposal selection, 2) Weakly Supervised Basic Detection Network (WSBDN) with background class representation and heatmap pre-supervision, 3) Negative certainty supervision loss for ignored proposals to accelerate convergence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and 55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, outperforming existing WSOD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the three key limitations in WSOD through innovative heatmap guidance, enhanced network architecture, and improved optimization techniques, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCroP is a vision-language pre-training framework for chest CT scans that addresses spatial sparsity of lesions and complex report-radiograph relationships through similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT scans have spatially sparse lesion distributions and complex implicit relationships between pathological descriptions and corresponding radiograph sub-regions, making medical vision-language pre-training challenging.

Method: Uses multi-modal masked modeling for low-level semantics, similarity-driven alignment to match report sentences with correct patches, and cross-granularity fusion integrating instance-level and word-patch level information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art medical self-supervised learning and vision-language pre-training methods on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets.

Conclusion: SimCroP effectively captures key pathology structures in sparse radiographs and improves performance for multi-scale downstream medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

TL;DR: BTS-EE is a sequential training method for early-exit CNNs that addresses covariance shift by aligning branch training with inference distributions, achieving 45% computation reduction with only 2% accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms requires balancing accuracy with latency/power budgets. Conventional early-exit training suffers from covariance shift where downstream branches are trained on full datasets but only process harder samples at inference.

Method: Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE) with sequential training where each branch is trained and calibrated before the next. Uses lightweight 1D convolution branch architecture and Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration for per-class threshold tuning.

Result: On CINIC-10 dataset with ResNet18 backbone, BTS-EE outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45% computation reduction with only 2% accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: BTS-EE expands design space for deploying CNNs in real-time systems, offering practical efficiency gains for industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV monitoring applications.

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNNs neglect clinical metadata and require extensive preprocessing, while VLMs trained on general data lack clinical specificity for melanoma diagnosis.

Method: Proposed a retrieval-augmented VLM framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into diagnostic prompts to enable informed predictions.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over conventional baselines without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support in melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Conclusion: InsFusion effectively mitigates error accumulation in 3D object detection pipelines and delivers superior performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for disentangling videos into motion and content components using transformer architecture and vector quantization, with diffusion model for representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general video disentanglement method with fewer assumptions than previous works, enabling better separation of dynamic motion from static content in videos.

Method: Transformer-based architecture with implicit features for motion and content, low-bitrate vector quantization as information bottleneck, and denoising diffusion model for self-supervised learning.

Result: Validated on talking head videos for motion transfer and generation tasks, and generalized to 2D cartoon character videos, demonstrating effective disentanglement.

Conclusion: Presents a novel perspective on self-supervised video representation learning that contributes to video analysis and generation with improved disentanglement capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing modular pipelines for 3D semantic occupancy prediction suffer from cascading errors due to independent optimization and pre-configured inputs, lacking holistic supervision.

Method: Designs a causal loss based on 2D-to-3D semantic causality principle to regulate gradient flow, making pipeline differentiable. Proposes three components: Channel-Grouped Lifting, Learnable Camera Offsets, and Normalized Convolution guided by this loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Occ3D benchmark with significant robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: The causal loss enables holistic end-to-end supervision, unifying learning process and making previously non-trainable components fully learnable, resulting in superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

TL;DR: Proposes Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) for real-time license plate image enhancement in traffic surveillance, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods with minimal parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle images in traffic surveillance often suffer from noise and blur due to adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion, which severely degrades license plate recognition accuracy, especially when plates occupy small regions in images.

Method: VRAE architecture with enhancement strategy using auxiliary blocks that inject input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide representation learning and preserve general information better than conventional autoencoders.

Result: Outperforms AE, GAN, and Flow-Based approaches - improves PSNR by ~20%, reduces NMSE by ~50%, enhances SSIM by 1%, with only ~1% parameter increase compared to AE at same depth.

Conclusion: VRAE provides effective real-time image enhancement for license plate recognition in challenging traffic surveillance conditions, demonstrating superior performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Motivation: Traditional BEV projection methods suffer from feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by object scale variations with distance, which degrades tracking accuracy and detection performance in multi-view scenarios.

Method: Combines three techniques: 1) Sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection, 2) Density-aware weighting for adaptive feature fusion based on spatial confidence and camera distance, 3) Multi-view consistency loss to encourage discriminative feature learning before fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 95.9% IDF1 score on WildTrack and 89.2% MODP on MultiviewX, outperforming baseline TrackTacular method.

Conclusion: SCFusion effectively mitigates limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust, accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking applications.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE is a novel framework that generates video counterfactual explanations using latent diffusion models, achieving better performance and faster inference than previous methods while maintaining temporal coherence and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based AI systems in safety-critical domains need interpretable decisions, but existing explanation techniques suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and lack of actionable causal insights.

Method: LD-ViCE operates in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model to reduce computational costs, with an additional refinement step to produce realistic and interpretable counterfactuals.

Result: LD-ViCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 68% increase in R2 score and reduces inference time by half across three diverse video datasets (EchoNet-Dynamic, FERV39k, Something-Something V2).

Conclusion: LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, representing a valuable step toward trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

*Xia Yue,Anfeng Liu,Ning Chen,Chenjia Huang,Hui Liu,Zhou Huang,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTTA is a unified framework that enhances hyperspectral image classification robustness against various degradations through a multi-degradation dataset, spectral-spatial transformer classifier, and lightweight test-time adaptation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by real-world degradations like noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects, requiring robust solutions.

Method: Constructed multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset with 9 degradation types; designed spectral-spatial transformer classifier with multi-level receptive field and label smoothing; developed confidence-aware entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter for test-time adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show HyperTTA outperforms existing baselines across various degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances model robustness through both its classification backbone and TTA scheme, enabling dynamic adaptation without source data or target annotations.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

*Ivan Stoyanov,Fabian Bongratz,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBDM: A spherical Brownian bridge diffusion model for accurate cortical thickness trajectory forecasting on brain surfaces using spherical convolutions and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of individualized cortical thickness trajectories is essential for detecting neurodegenerative changes and enabling early interventions, but challenging due to the cortex's non-Euclidean geometry and need for multi-modal integration.

Method: Proposed Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM) with bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge process and conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet) combining spherical convolutions with dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular data.

Result: SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors compared to previous approaches on ADNI and OASIS datasets, and can generate both factual and counterfactual cortical thickness trajectories.

Conclusion: SBDM provides a novel framework for accurate cortical thickness forecasting and exploring hypothetical cortical development scenarios, offering improved precision for neurodegenerative disease monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

*Yujie Zhu,Xinyi Zhang,Yekai Lu,Guang Yang,Faming Fang,Guixu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSSM improves Mamba for super-resolution by incorporating token correlations through first-order hold discretization, achieving state-of-the-art results without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Mamba-based vision models focus on architecture and scan paths, neglecting the SSM module itself. The authors want to explore SSM's potential for lightweight super-resolution tasks.

Method: Modified SSM calculation process using first-order hold condition to derive new discretized form, analyzed cumulative error, and incorporated token correlations to enhance Mamba module.

Result: FSSM improves MambaIR performance on five benchmark datasets without additional parameters, surpassing current lightweight SR methods with state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The First-order State Space Model (FSSM) effectively enhances SSM performance for vision tasks by better handling token correlations through improved discretization methodology.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [31] [Maximally Useful and Minimally Redundant: The Key to Self Supervised Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08469)
*Yash Kumar Sharma,Vineet Nair,Wilson Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-view contrastive self-supervised learning method using mutual information theory to handle imbalanced datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive self-supervised learning performs poorly on imbalanced datasets despite working well on balanced data. The paper addresses this limitation by extending the multi-view framework beyond two views as suggested by Yann LeCun.

Method: Develops a theoretical justification using mutual information for more than two views, introduces a loss function to filter extreme features and segregate intra/inter discriminatory characteristics, and applies it to both contrastive and non-contrastive frameworks.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 2% on Cifar10-LT, 5% on Cifar100-LT, and 3% on Imagenet-LT using ResNet architectures, setting new state-of-the-art accuracy for self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification.

Conclusion: The multi-view objective with more than two views effectively addresses dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning by extracting better representations of tail classes through improved feature discrimination.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified pipeline for prompt-driven image analysis that combines detection, segmentation, inpainting, and description into a single workflow with transparent debugging and both UI/CLI interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, reliable system that converts natural language instructions into multiple image processing steps (locate, segment, edit, describe) through a single prompt interface.

Method: Combines open-vocabulary detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and vision-language description into an end-to-end workflow with intermediate artifact retention for debugging.

Result: Achieved over 90% usable mask production with 85% accuracy in single-word prompts, identified inpainting as the main performance bottleneck (60-75% of runtime), and established reliable operational practices.

Conclusion: The study provides implementation guidance and a transparent pattern for assembling vision models behind single prompts, improving reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal tasks.

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This review paper systematically analyzes challenges in underwater object detection (UOD) and explores the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to address issues like image degradation, small object detection, and data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UOD is crucial for marine applications but faces significant challenges including image quality degradation, target-related issues, and computational constraints that current methods fail to fully address.

Method: The review categorizes UOD challenges into five areas, analyzes progression from traditional to modern approaches, explores LVLMs' multi-modal capabilities, and presents case studies using DALL-E 3 for synthetic data generation and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM.

Result: Three key insights: current UOD methods are insufficient for dynamic underwater environments; synthetic data generation shows potential but needs refinement; LVLMs hold promise but real-time applications require further optimization research.

Conclusion: LVLMs represent a promising direction for advancing UOD capabilities, though significant research is needed to address real-time implementation challenges and ensure synthetic data realism for practical underwater applications.

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

*Piyush Bagad,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces chiral action recognition to measure time-sensitivity in video representations and proposes a self-supervised method to enhance time awareness in frozen image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop compact video representations sensitive to visual changes over time, addressing the limitation that many video embeddings poorly represent temporally opposite actions like opening/closing doors.

Method: Self-supervised adaptation recipe using an auto-encoder with perceptual straightening-inspired latent space to inject time-sensitivity into frozen image feature sequences.

Result: Outperforms larger video models on chiral action recognition across Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade datasets, and improves classification performance when combined with existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully creates compact, time-sensitive video representations that excel at distinguishing temporally opposite actions and enhances standard video classification benchmarks.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuMo is a unified Human-Centric Video Generation framework that addresses multimodal coordination challenges through a two-stage training approach with specialized strategies for subject preservation and audio-visual synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HCVG methods struggle to effectively coordinate heterogeneous modalities (text, image, audio) due to scarce paired training data and difficulties in collaborating subject preservation with audio-visual sync tasks.

Method: Two-stage progressive multimodal training: 1) Minimal-invasive image injection for subject preservation, 2) Focus-by-predicting strategy for audio-visual sync with time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance during inference.

Result: HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in sub-tasks and establishes a unified framework for collaborative multimodal-conditioned HCVG.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses multimodal coordination challenges in human-centric video generation through progressive training and specialized strategies, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MESH is a new benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in Large Video Models (LVMs) that uses a bottom-up QA framework aligned with human perception, showing LVMs struggle with fine details and multi-subject actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks rely on manual categorization and neglect human perception processes, creating a need for systematic evaluation that aligns with natural video interpretation.

Method: MESH uses Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances, following bottom-up evaluation of basic objects, coarse-to-fine features, and subject-action pairs.

Result: LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features but show significantly increased hallucinations when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.

Conclusion: MESH provides an effective and comprehensive approach for systematically identifying hallucinations in LVMs, revealing their limitations in complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViewSparsifier approach using multi-view plant imaging with random view selection won both plant age prediction and leaf count estimation tasks in the GroMo Grand Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view classification/regression models often fail to capture all information needed for accurate phenotypic trait estimation, affecting plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.

Method: Multi-view dataset with plants photographed from multiple heights and angles. Used ViewSparsifier approach with 24-view selection vectors and experimented with randomized view selection across 120 total views (5 height levels).

Result: Won both tasks (Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation) in the ACM Multimedia 2025 GroMo Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: Multi-view approach with view-invariant embeddings significantly outperforms single-view methods for plant phenotyping, with potential for further improvement through expanded view selection matrices.

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

TL;DR: Proposes EM Aggregation and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder to address multimodal fusion challenges in medical image segmentation, improving cross-modal correspondence and bridging semantic gaps between text and medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models underperform in medical domain due to semantic gap between abstract textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, and resulting feature dispersion issues.

Method: Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism to cluster features into compact semantic centers, and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder to leverage domain-invariant textual knowledge for guiding visual representations.

Result: Outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks on public cardiac and fundus datasets.

Conclusion: The synergy between EM Aggregation and Text-Guided Pixel Decoder significantly improves model generalization ability in medical image segmentation by addressing multimodal fusion challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate

TL;DR: This paper introduces an implicit shape prior method to reduce manual segmentation workload in medical 3D imaging by using sparse slice annotations and automatically selecting the most informative slices for multi-organ segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the manual workload for medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks like radiotherapy planning and degenerative disease diagnosis, where organs at risk must be accurately identified and muscle volume measurements require manual segmentation.

Method: Proposes an implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations generalized for multi-organ cases, with a framework for automatically selecting the most informative slices to minimize subsequent interactions.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates effectiveness on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation of at-risk organs for brain cancer patients and accelerating database creation for patients with sarcopenia with unseen muscle shapes.

Conclusion: The method successfully reduces manual segmentation burden in medical imaging applications, showing promise for improving efficiency in radiotherapy planning and degenerative disease diagnosis workflows.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

*Jinhan Li,Haoyang He,Lei Xie,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed EfficientIML model with EfficientRWKV backbone for detecting diffusion-based image manipulations, outperforms SOTA methods in localization, efficiency, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors lack exposure to diffusion-based forgeries and face computational constraints with high-resolution images.

Method: Lightweight three-stage EfficientRWKV backbone combining state-space and attention networks with multi-scale supervision.

Result: Outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in localization performance, FLOPs, and inference speed.

Conclusion: Suitable for real-time forensic applications with efficient high-resolution manipulation detection.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Shahrooz Faghihroohi,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLAPS is a novel automated segmentation method that uses CLIP-based image encoding, GroundingDINO for automatic prompt generation, and SAM for precise segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across diverse retinal imaging tasks without manual prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in medical image segmentation including modality ambiguity in textual descriptions, reliance on manual prompting for SAM workflows, and lack of unified frameworks for diverse retinal imaging tasks and modalities.

Method: Pre-train CLIP-based image encoder on multi-modal retinal data, use GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting lesions, employ text prompts with modality signatures to resolve ambiguity, and guide SAM for automated segmentation.

Result: Achieves performance on par with specialized expert models and surpasses existing benchmarks across most metrics on 12 diverse datasets covering 11 critical segmentation categories.

Conclusion: CLAPS demonstrates broad generalizability as a foundation model, providing a fully automated and unified pipeline for precise segmentation across diverse retinal imaging tasks and modalities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdsQA, a novel benchmark using advertisement videos to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand complex marketing content beyond basic visual perception. The authors also propose ReAd-R, a reinforcement learning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this challenging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend LLM capabilities beyond general-purpose domains by testing them on advertisement videos, which contain rich marketing logic, persuasive strategies, and audience engagement elements that require deeper expertise and understanding.

Method: Created AdsQA benchmark with 1,544 ad videos (10,962 clips, 22.7 hours) featuring 5 challenging tasks. Proposed ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that reflects on questions and generates answers through reward-driven optimization.

Result: Benchmarked 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA. The proposed ReAd-R model achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong competitors with long-chain reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Conclusion: Advertisement videos provide a valuable test-bed for evaluating LLMs' advanced perception abilities beyond basic visual content understanding. The ReAd-R model demonstrates effective performance on these challenging marketing-focused tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

*Eric Slyman,Mehrab Tanjim,Kushal Kafle,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMB, a multimodal Bayesian prompt ensemble method that improves accuracy and calibration for text-to-image evaluation by dynamically weighting prompts based on visual characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs used as judges for TTI systems suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across image domains, and standard ensembling methods don't work well for multimodal tasks.

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB) using Bayesian prompt ensemble augmented by image clustering to dynamically assign prompt weights based on visual characteristics.

Result: MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and enhances calibration, outperforming baselines on HPSv2 and MJBench benchmarks with better alignment to human annotations.

Conclusion: Multimodal-specific strategies like MMB are crucial for reliable judge calibration and provide a promising approach for large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

### [45] [UOPSL: Unpaired OCT Predilection Sites Learning for Fundus Image Diagnosis Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08624)
*Zhihao Zhao,Yinzheng Zhao,Junjie Yang,Xiangtong Yao,Quanmin Liang,Daniel Zapp,Kai Huang,Nassir Navab,M. Ali Nasseri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unpaired multimodal framework called UOPSL that uses OCT-derived spatial priors to enhance fundus image-based disease recognition without requiring paired multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images is expensive and limited, with OCT data scarcity and modality imbalance hindering progress. Existing approaches fail to capture fine-grained spatial information from different imaging modalities.

Method: UOPSL uses contrastive learning on unpaired OCT and fundus images to learn predilection sites matrix in OCT latent space, then leverages this matrix to assist fundus image classification when OCT data is unavailable.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 diverse datasets across 28 categories demonstrate superior performance over existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges unpaired fundus and OCT data using spatial priors, enabling improved disease recognition with limited multimodal data availability.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADB is a semi-supervised framework that uses partially paired data to bridge domain gaps in diffusion models, enabling sample-to-sample translation without full supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of diffusion models in data-scarce domains where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are required, providing a solution for scenarios with incomplete data annotation.

Method: Aligns source and target distributions in shared latent space, integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM) trained on partially paired latent representations.

Result: Superior performance in depth-to-image translation under partial supervision, successfully extended to multi-source translation (depth maps + segmentation masks) and multi-target translation in class-conditioned style transfer.

Conclusion: LADB provides a scalable and versatile solution for real-world domain translation, particularly effective when data annotation is costly or incomplete, balancing fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

TL;DR: DSLNet introduces a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that separates gesture morphology and trajectory modeling using wrist-centric and facial-centric coordinate systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance on sign language recognition benchmarks with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR methods struggle with morphologically similar but semantically distinct gestures due to geometric ambiguity from using single reference frames, limiting their ability to distinguish between similar signs.

Method: Dual-reference dual-stream architecture with wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling, using specialized networks (topology-aware graph convolution for shape, Finsler geometry encoder for trajectory) integrated via geometry-driven optimal transport fusion.

Result: Achieved 93.70% on WLASL-100, 89.97% on WLASL-300, and 99.79% on LSA64 datasets, setting new state-of-the-art with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Conclusion: DSLNet successfully addresses geometric ambiguity in sign language recognition by decoupling shape and trajectory modeling in complementary coordinate systems, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

TL;DR: FractalPINN-Flow is an unsupervised deep learning framework for optical flow estimation that learns from consecutive grayscale frames without ground truth, using a fractal-inspired recursive encoder-decoder architecture with TV regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an optical flow estimation method that doesn't require ground truth annotations and can handle high-resolution data effectively, addressing limitations of traditional supervised approaches.

Method: Uses Fractal Deformation Network (FDN) with recursive encoder-decoder nesting and skip connections. Minimizes energy functional with L1/L2 data fidelity terms for brightness constancy and total variation regularization for spatial smoothness.

Result: Produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow fields. Effective for high-resolution data and scenarios with limited annotations, as demonstrated on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow provides an effective unsupervised approach for optical flow estimation that leverages fractal geometry principles and variational regularization to achieve high-quality results without requiring ground truth data.

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

TL;DR: CrowdQuery (CQ) is a novel method that enhances transformer-based detectors by embedding object density maps into object queries, improving crowd detection in both 2D and 3D without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd detection methods struggle with crowded scenes and typically rely on head positions or object-based spatial statistics. There's a need for a universal approach that works for both 2D and 3D detection while effectively handling density information.

Method: Developed CQ module that predicts and embeds object density maps, extending density definitions to include bounding box dimensions. Integrated density information into decoder via density-guided queries. Created CQ2D and CQ3D architectures for 2D and 3D transformer-based detectors.

Result: Significant performance improvements on STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods. Further improved performance on CrowdHuman dataset when integrated with state-of-the-art crowd detector.

Conclusion: CrowdQuery effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in crowded environments, is universally applicable without additional data, and demonstrates strong generalizability across different datasets and detection domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

TL;DR: ArgoTweak is the first dataset providing realistic map priors, current maps, and sensor data to address the sim2real gap in HD mapping, enabling more reliable prior integration and self-updating maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic priors due to lack of public datasets with the required triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data, creating inconsistencies and sim2real gaps.

Method: Uses a bijective mapping framework that breaks large-scale map modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the element level for interpretability and high fidelity preservation of unchanged elements.

Result: Training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors, with extensive ablations showing the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations.

Conclusion: ArgoTweak establishes a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping and advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions by providing realistic data and tools for reliable prior integration.

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The

Conclusion: The framework shows deep learning's potential for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable arsenicosis diagnosis from mobile images, serving as practical diagnostic aid in resource-limited communities for early detection and intervention.

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

### [55] [Quantifying Accuracy of an Event-Based Star Tracker via Earth's Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08794)
*Dennis Melamed,Connor Hashemi,Scott McCloskey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based cameras achieve 18.47 arcseconds RMS accuracy for star tracking using Earth's rotation as ground truth, demonstrating potential for low-cost, low-latency attitude determination systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras show promise for star tracking but lack accurate ground truth validation in prior studies. This research aims to quantify EBC accuracy using Earth's regular rotation as a precise reference.

Method: Static event camera mounted on ground telescope captures night sky events. Earth's rotation provides known motion reference. Event streams processed for orientation estimates compared against IERS Earth orientation measurements.

Result: Achieved 18.47 arcseconds RMS error and 78.84 arcseconds about error. Demonstrates EBCs can provide accurate star tracking while offering benefits like sparser data, higher dynamic range, lower energy consumption, and faster update rates.

Conclusion: Event cameras are viable for low-cost, low-latency star tracking applications, with accuracy sufficient for many attitude determination needs while providing computational and energy efficiency advantages over traditional framing sensors.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

*Matthieu Vilain,Rémi Giraud,Yannick Berthoumieu,Guillaume Bourmaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER introduces a novel dense image matching approach that predicts multiple correspondent hypotheses per pixel at each scale using beam search, improving robustness in challenging cases like depth discontinuities and strong zoom-ins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dense matching methods produce single correspondent hypotheses per pixel, which fails in challenging scenarios where neighboring correspondences are widely spread, leading to erroneous matches.

Method: Proposes a beam search strategy to propagate multiple hypotheses at each scale and integrates these hypotheses into cross-attention layers, creating the BEAMER architecture that preserves and propagates multiple correspondences across scales.

Result: BEAMER demonstrates significantly improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly at depth discontinuities and when handling strong zoom-in scenarios between source and target images.

Conclusion: Predicting multiple correspondent hypotheses per pixel using beam search and cross-attention integration provides a more effective approach for dense image matching, especially in challenging cases where single-hypothesis methods fail.

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

*Jenna Kang,Maria Silva,Patsorn Sangkloy,Kenneth Chen,Niall Williams,Qi Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeneVA is a large-scale annotated dataset for benchmarking spatio-temporal artifacts in text-to-video generation models, addressing the lack of systematic evaluation tools for video generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models produce unpredictable artifacts in videos (impossible physics, temporal inconsistency), but current benchmarks focus mainly on images, leaving a gap for systematic video quality evaluation.

Method: Created GeneVA - a large-scale artifact dataset with rich human annotations specifically designed for spatio-temporal artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts.

Result: The paper introduces a comprehensive dataset that enables systematic benchmarking of video generation models, addressing the unique challenges of spatio-temporal consistency in generated videos.

Conclusion: GeneVA fills a critical gap in video generation evaluation and will enable better benchmarking and quality improvement for text-to-video generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

### [58] [RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826)
*Jie Wu,Yu Gao,Zilyu Ye,Ming Li,Liang Li,Hanzhong Guo,Jie Liu,Zeyue Xue,Xiaoxia Hou,Wei Liu,Yan Zeng,Weilin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardDance is a scalable reward modeling framework that introduces a generative reward paradigm to overcome limitations in existing approaches, enabling scaling to 26B parameters and resolving reward hacking issues in visual generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for visual generation suffer from architectural constraints, modality limitations, and misalignment with VLMs' next-token prediction. The RLHF optimization process is plagued by reward hacking where models exploit reward signal flaws without improving true quality.

Method: RewardDance reformulates reward scoring as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token indicating generated image outperforms reference image. This aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures and enables scaling across model size (up to 26B parameters) and context (instructions, references, chain-of-thought).

Result: Extensive experiments show RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Large-scale RMs exhibit high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: RewardDance resolves the persistent reward hacking challenge and greatly relieves mode collapse problems that plague smaller models, providing a scalable solution for reward modeling in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

*David Stotko,Reinhard Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel approach combining 3D geometry reconstruction and appearance estimation for fabrics using only monocular RGB video, with improved reconstruction accuracy and realistic rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D dynamic scenes, particularly fabrics, from monocular video while overcoming depth ambiguity issues and achieving high-quality deformations and renderings.

Method: Combines physical simulation of cloth geometry with differentiable rendering, introduces two novel regularization terms to address depth ambiguity in monocular 3D reconstruction.

Result: Reduced 3D reconstruction error by factor of 2.64 compared to recent methods, with medium runtime of 30 min per scene. Achieved sufficient motion quality for appearance estimation and recovery of sharp details.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully performs both 3D reconstruction and appearance estimation for deforming fabrics from single monocular video, demonstrating significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy while maintaining practical runtime.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

*Abigail Breitfeld,Alberto Candela,Juan Delfa,Akseli Kangaslahti,Itai Zilberstein,Steve Chien,David Wettergreen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning-based dynamic targeting for Earth observation satellites using reinforcement and imitation learning outperforms heuristic methods by 10-13.7% in scientific data collection efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observing satellites have limitations in orbital flexibility, sensor field of view, and resource allocation. They need to optimize data collection by focusing on the most informative measurements through intelligent targeting.

Method: Two learning-based approaches: reinforcement learning and imitation learning, building on a dynamic programming solution to plan sampling location sequences. Both methods are trained with relatively small datasets.

Result: Imitation learning performed 10.0% better than the best heuristic method, while reinforcement learning performed 13.7% better on average. Both learning methods were effective with small training data.

Conclusion: Learning-based approaches significantly improve dynamic targeting performance for Earth observation satellites, enabling more efficient scientific data collection compared to conventional heuristic methods.

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

*Linyao Chen,Zimian Peng,Yingxuan Yang,Yikun Wang,Wenzheng Tom Tang,Hiroki H. Kobayashi,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX is an AI framework that transforms GitHub repositories into intelligent agents capable of natural language interaction and collaboration, automating software reuse through environment setup, autonomous task execution, and inter-agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current software reuse from open-source repositories is manual, error-prone, and disconnected, requiring developers to navigate documentation, understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to efficient software component utilization.

Method: EnvX uses Agentic AI to agentize repositories through a three-phase process: TODO-guided environment initialization, human-aligned agentic automation for autonomous task execution, and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for multi-agent collaboration, combining LLM capabilities with structured tool integration.

Result: On the GitTaskBench benchmark with 18 repositories across multiple domains, EnvX achieved 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks and demonstrating effective multi-repository collaboration through A2A protocol.

Conclusion: EnvX represents a paradigm shift from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent, interactive agents, significantly improving accessibility and collaboration in the open-source ecosystem by automating the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality.

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [62] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a 2TSD model using LAM-driven teacher-student architecture to efficiently evaluate device trustworthiness for collaborative computing tasks, reducing evaluation time and resource consumption while improving selection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional independent trust evaluation by each task owner causes significant overhead from frequent data exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes, leading to deteriorated trust assessment.

Method: Uses LAM-driven teacher-student agent architecture where teacher agent on server handles multidimensional trust data collection, task-specific trust semantics extraction, and matching analysis, then transfers semantics to student agents for rapid collaborator selection.

Result: Experimental results show reduced collaborator evaluation time, decreased device resource consumption, and improved accuracy of collaborator selection.

Conclusion: The 2TSD model effectively addresses trust evaluation challenges in collaborative computing by leveraging centralized semantic distillation and transfer learning approach.

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

TL;DR: ExRAP framework enhances LLM-based embodied agents for continual instruction following in dynamic environments through exploration-augmented planning and memory-based query evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of embodied agents performing continual instruction following tasks in dynamic, non-stationary environments where traditional LLMs struggle with grounding task planning in time-varying contexts.

Method: Proposes Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework that combines information-based exploration with LLM-based planning, uses environmental context memory for query evaluation, and implements temporal consistency refinement to handle knowledge decay.

Result: Demonstrates robustness across VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA environments, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches in goal success rate and execution efficiency across various instruction scales/types and non-stationarity degrees.

Conclusion: ExRAP effectively balances environmental context memory validity with exploration load, improves task performance in dynamic environments, and addresses knowledge decay through temporal consistency refinement, making it a robust solution for continual embodied instruction following.

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach represents a new era in compliance reporting, bringing AI agent benefits to regulatory processes for scalable, reliable, and transparent SAR generation while maintaining human-in-the-loop collaboration.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from

greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI

TL;DR: TCPO method improves embodied AI decision-making by aligning intermediate reasoning processes and using stepwise preference optimization, achieving 26.67% success rate in ALFWorld with 6% improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision language models struggle with dynamic embodied tasks due to sluggish responses, hallucinations, and model degradation issues in changing environments. Existing post-SFT methods suffer from sparse rewards and poor sample efficiency.

Method: Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) with stepwise preference-based optimization that transforms sparse rewards into richer step samples, plus Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC) for output consistency.

Result: Achieved 26.67% average success rate in ALFWorld environment, representing a 6% improvement over RL4VLM baseline, demonstrating effective mitigation of model degradation.

Conclusion: TCPO successfully integrates preference-based learning with chain-of-thought processes to enhance vision-language models' decision-making capabilities for embodied agents, addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

TL;DR: Using logical consistency between disagreeing LLM judges to detect misaligned evaluators without ground truth knowledge


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the infinite monitoring chain problem when using LLMs to evaluate other LLMs without knowing ground truth or wanting to trust experts completely

Method: Formalizing logical consistency between disagreeing LLM judges as a Linear Programming problem in integer response count space to compute possible evaluation scores

Result: Development of no-knowledge alarms that can detect with no false positives when at least one member of an LLM judge ensemble violates specified grading ability requirements

Conclusion: Logical consistency analysis provides a reliable method to monitor LLM judges without requiring ground truth knowledge, enabling detection of misaligned evaluators through disagreement patterns

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Jiawei Shen,Jingjiang Liu,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel failure attribution framework for multi-agent systems using multi-granularity causal inference, achieving 36.2% step-level accuracy and boosting task success rates by 22.4% through automated optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic tools for multi-agent systems are inadequate, achieving less than 15% accuracy in locating root-cause failures, severely hampering practical deployment of MAS.

Method: Two key contributions: (1) performance causal inversion principle that reverses data flow in execution logs combined with Shapley values for agent-level blame assignment, (2) CDC-MAS causal discovery algorithm that handles non-stationary MAS interaction data.

Result: Achieves up to 36.2% step-level accuracy on Who&When and TRAIL benchmarks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Generated optimizations boost overall task success rates by an average of 22.4%.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and effective solution for debugging complex agent interactions, enabling more reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems through automated optimization loops.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: Novel dual-process Theory of Mind framework combining fast graph-based reasoning (System 1) and slow meta-adaptive learning (System 2) with dynamic balancing through context gate mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge artificial intelligence and cognitive theory by creating AI systems that exhibit human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities, inspired by dual-process theories from cognitive science.

Method: Integrated graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for fast habitual reasoning (System 1) with meta-learning techniques for context-sensitive adaptive learning (System 2), using a learned context gate mechanism to dynamically balance intuitive and deliberative reasoning.

Result: The model closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust generalization to unseen contexts, and successfully replicates hallmark cognitive biases including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing effects, and priming effects on false-belief tasks.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges AI and cognitive theory, demonstrating that dual-process architectures can produce nuanced human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making, paving the way for more psychologically plausible AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

*Ziming Luo,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Nihar B. Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI scientist systems have potential but risk hidden failures. Paper identifies 4 failure modes, tests them on real systems, finds issues, and recommends requiring workflow artifacts for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI scientist systems can accelerate research but their internal workflows lack scrutiny, risking flawed outputs that undermine scientific integrity and trustworthiness.

Method: Designed controlled experiments to isolate four failure modes: inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc selection bias. Assessed two prominent open-source AI scientist systems.

Result: Found presence of several failures across a spectrum of severity that can be easily overlooked in practice. Showed that access to trace logs and code enables much more effective failure detection than examining final papers alone.

Conclusion: Recommends journals and conferences mandate submission of workflow artifacts (trace logs and code) alongside AI-generated papers to ensure transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Experimental platform combining reinforcement learning with language model reasoning to study how narrative frameworks influence AI decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between AI's decision-making capabilities and narrative reasoning, which have been studied separately, to explore how narrative elements can shape reward-based learning.

Method: Dual-system architecture with RL policy for action suggestions and language model processing through narrative frameworks. Implemented in configurable gridworld environment with modular design for controlled testing.

Result: Preliminary implementation provides foundation for studying narrative framework effects on decisions and exploring interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning.

Conclusion: The platform enables initial experimentation with narrative elements while maintaining consistent environment structures, facilitating future research on narrative influence in AI decision-making.

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

TL;DR: Bilingual language identification for Wolaita and Gofa languages using BERT+LSTM approach achieves 0.72 F1 score, addressing challenges from language similarities in Ethiopian multilingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language identification is crucial for multilingual communities where text often contains multiple languages. The task becomes challenging for Wolaita and Gofa languages due to their similarities and differences, particularly in southern Ethiopia where these languages coexist.

Method: Employed various experimental approaches, with the best performance coming from a combination of BERT-based pretrained language model and LSTM architecture for bilingual language identification.

Result: The BERT+LSTM approach achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test set, effectively distinguishing between Wolaita and Gofa languages despite their similarities.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution for bilingual language identification that can help address social media issues in multilingual communities and serves as a foundation for further research in this area.

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote is a bi-level optimization method that makes LLMs resistant to malicious fine-tuning by training them to nullify adversarial weight modifications while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight LLMs face security risks from malicious fine-tuning that can erase safety safeguards. Current methods struggle to balance safety preservation with maintaining model utility against determined adversaries.

Method: Uses bi-level optimization with an auxiliary adversary hypernetwork that generates malicious LoRA weights conditioned on the defender model's activations. The defender LLM is trained to nullify these adversarial weight additions.

Result: 27.4% more robust against 52 red-teaming attacks (jailbreak prompts, latent space manipulation, weight-space attacks) with minimal utility loss (<0.5% degradation on MMLU, HellaSwag, GSM8K benchmarks).

Conclusion: Provides a practical and compute-efficient methodology for building open-weight models with more integral and resilient safety properties.

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized

Motivation: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating bottlenecks for knowledge synthesis. General-purpose LLMs fail to capture scientific nuances and struggle with complex scientific tasks, limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research.

Method: Built on Qwen3 architecture with three innovations: (1) low-cost domain distillation via two-stage pipeline, (2) Sparse Mixture-of-Experts attention mechanism for memory efficiency, (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to bridge interdisciplinary gaps.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o in core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference. Shows strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks with 55% memory reduction for 32,000-token documents.

Conclusion: SciGPT demonstrates potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery through effective domain adaptation and efficient long-document processing capabilities.

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

*Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Paul Röttger,Nino Scherrer,Emanuele Borgonovo,Elmar Plischke,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona prompting in LLMs can cause false refusals, but the effect is smaller in more capable models and influenced by model choice and task type rather than just sociodemographic personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of sociodemographic personas on false refusal rates in LLMs, as previous work suggested persona prompting leads to false request refusals but lacked comprehensive measurement.

Method: Tested 15 sociodemographic personas across 16 models, 3 tasks (NLI, politeness, offensiveness classification), and 9 prompt paraphrases using a Monte Carlo-based approach for sample efficiency.

Result: More capable models show less persona impact on refusal rates. Model choice and task type significantly influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Some personas increase false refusal in certain models, indicating alignment biases.

Conclusion: Persona effects on false refusals have been overestimated and are more influenced by model capabilities and task context than sociodemographic factors alone.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop human-like efficient semantic categorization systems through Information Bottleneck principles, similar to human language evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can evolve efficient human-like semantic systems despite not being explicitly trained for Information Bottleneck optimization, using color categorization as a test case.

Method: Replicated two human behavioral studies with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct): 1) English color-naming study comparing with native speakers, 2) Simulated cultural evolution via iterated in-context learning to test if LLMs restructure systems toward IB-efficiency.

Result: Gemini aligned well with English speakers and achieved high IB-efficiency, Llama showed efficient but lower complexity system. Both LLMs iteratively restructured random systems toward greater IB-efficiency and cross-linguistic patterns, similar to humans.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems driven by the same Information Bottleneck efficiency principle that governs human language semantics.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

TL;DR: MERLIN is a two-stage model-stacking framework that uses curriculum learning and DoRA weights to significantly improve reasoning accuracy in low-resource languages, outperforming existing methods and GPT-4o-mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex reasoning in low-resource languages (LRLs), and existing encoder-decoder methods leave a large performance gap for these languages.

Method: Two-stage model-stacking framework with curriculum learning strategy (from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data) using only a small set of DoRA weights for adaptation.

Result: +12.9 pp improvement over MindMerger on AfriMGSM benchmark, outperforms GPT-4o-mini, and consistent gains on MGSM (+0.9 pp) and MSVAMP (+2.8 pp) across both low and high-resource settings.

Conclusion: MERLIN effectively addresses the reasoning gap in low-resource languages through its curriculum learning approach and lightweight adaptation, demonstrating strong performance across diverse language resource settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biases in pre-trained LLMs transfer to adapted models through prompting, and current debiasing methods don't consistently prevent this transfer across models, tasks, and demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that biases don't transfer from pre-trained LLMs to adapted models, particularly through prompt adaptations which are widely used in real-world applications.

Method: Studied bias transfer hypothesis in causal models under prompt adaptations, examining correlation between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation across demographics (gender, age, religion) and tasks (co-reference resolution, question answering). Evaluated various few-shot composition parameters and prompt-based debiasing strategies.

Result: Found strong correlations between intrinsic and adapted biases (rho >= 0.94 for gender, >= 0.98 for age, >= 0.69 for religion). Biases remained strongly correlated across different few-shot parameters (rho >= 0.90). Prompt-based debiasing strategies showed distinct strengths but none consistently reduced bias transfer.

Conclusion: Correcting bias in intrinsic models may be necessary to prevent bias propagation to downstream tasks, as biases transfer through prompting and current mitigation methods are inconsistent.

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbalized Algorithms (VAs) use classical algorithms with LLMs as simple operation oracles instead of one-shot querying for complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability of LLMs on reasoning tasks by limiting their scope to simple, well-defined operations within established algorithmic frameworks.

Method: Decompose tasks into elementary natural language operations, use LLMs as binary comparison oracles within classical algorithms like bitonic sorting networks.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on sorting and clustering tasks through reliable performance using simple LLM operations.

Conclusion: VAs provide a more reliable approach than one-shot LLM querying by leveraging classical algorithms and limiting LLMs to simple, well-defined operations.

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

### [83] [Balancing Quality and Variation: Spam Filtering Distorts Data Label Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08217)
*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing annotator filtering methods designed for objective tasks often remove legitimate disagreement instead of spam, hurting label diversity in subjective tasks. Conservative filtering (<5% removal) works best, and spammers tend to be less random than real annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance annotator reliability and representation in machine learning datasets, ensuring both quality filtering and preservation of diverse opinions in subjective labeling tasks.

Method: Empirical evaluation of various annotator filtering heuristics on subjective tasks, analyzing how they affect label variation preservation and comparing performance on synthetic spam data.

Result: Most filtering methods remove disagreeing annotators rather than spammers, increasing error from true average labels. Spammers are distributionally similar to real annotators but tend to give fixed (not random) answers.

Conclusion: Existing spam filtering methods are ill-suited for subjective tasks requiring variation preservation. New methods are needed that account for label diversity and recognize that spammers are typically less random than legitimate annotators.

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

*Yehudit Aperstein,Alon Gottlib,Gal Benita,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for modeling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR) using QA-based approach to classify document pairs into equivalence, inclusion, or semantic overlap based on information alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how information is shared across documents regardless of format is critical for information retrieval, summarization, and content alignment tasks.

Method: QA-based approach using answerability of shared questions across documents as indicator of semantic coverage. Synthetic dataset from SQuAD with paraphrased passages and controlled information omission. Benchmarking generative models and training transformer classifiers.

Result: Discriminative models outperform generative approaches. RoBERTa-base achieved highest accuracy (61.4%) and Random Forest showed best balance (macro-F1 52.9%). QA effectively assesses semantic relations across diverse texts.

Conclusion: QA provides effective lens for assessing semantic relations, offering insights into models' capacity to reason about information beyond surface similarity. Dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Motivation: To enhance transparency of automated writing scores by providing detailed subtrait assessment that demystifies scores for educators and students.

Method: Prototyping explainability and subtrait scoring using generative language models to assess latent-trait components of writing.

Result: Modest correlation observed between human subtrait and trait scores, and between automated and human subtrait scores.

Conclusion: The approach provides detailed scoring explanations that can help educators and students better understand automated writing assessment results.

Abstract: Subtrait (latent-trait components) assessment presents a promising path
toward enhancing transparency of automated writing scores. We prototype

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of regularly updating detection models in production systems to maintain effectiveness

Abstract: In high-stakes English Language Assessments, low-skill test takers may employ
memorized materials called ``templates'' on essay questions to ``game'' or fool

*Sergey Pletenev,Daniil Moskovskiy,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated synthetic toxic data performs worse than human data for text detoxification training, with up to 30% performance drop due to limited lexical diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLM-generated synthetic toxic data can effectively replace human-generated data for training detoxification models in sensitive domains.

Method: Used Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models to generate synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets, then compared fine-tuned models on synthetic vs human data.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data consistently performed worse than those trained on human data, with up to 30% performance drop in joint metrics, due to LLMs generating toxic content with limited, repetitive vocabulary.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in generating diverse toxic content, highlighting the continued importance of human-annotated data for building robust detoxification systems.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETLCH is a billion-parameter LLaMA model fine-tuned with LoRA on minimal data (few hundred to 1k samples per task) for structured data extraction tasks, outperforming larger models at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller teams struggle with high costs of large LLMs and dataset preparation for structured data extraction in domains like finance, legal, and multilingual knowledge bases. Limited evidence exists on whether small models can work reliably in low-resource, multi-task conditions.

Method: Developed ETLCH - a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. Demonstrates stable and accurate structured outputs despite small scale.

Conclusion: Well-tuned small models can deliver reliable structured data extraction at a fraction of computational cost, enabling cost-effective information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: New large-scale real-human speech dataset (CommonVoice-SpeechRE) and novel framework (RPG-MoGe) for speech relation extraction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SpeechRE datasets rely heavily on synthetic data and lack diversity, while current models suffer from rigid generation templates and weak semantic alignment.

Method: Proposed RPG-MoGe framework with multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy and CNN-based latent relation prediction heads for explicit relation prompts and cross-modal alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both benchmark dataset and effective solution for real-world SpeechRE applications.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key limitations in SpeechRE by introducing diverse real-human speech data and an advanced generative ensemble framework with improved cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

*Fanzhen Liu,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Surya Nepal,Cecile Paris,Jia Wu,Jian Yang,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on adversarial attacks against automated fact-checking systems, analyzing attack methodologies, defenses, and research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads rapidly and automated fact-checking systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate claims, evidence, or their relationships, undermining system reliability.

Method: Comprehensive literature review and categorization of existing adversarial attack methodologies targeting fact-checking systems, evaluation of their impacts, and examination of adversary-aware defense mechanisms.

Result: Identified various attack strategies that can distort truth and mislead decision-makers, highlighting the vulnerability of current fact-checking models to adversarial manipulations.

Conclusion: Urgent need for developing resilient fact-checking frameworks that can withstand adversarial attacks while maintaining high verification accuracy, with several open research questions requiring further exploration.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

### [91] [Acquiescence Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08480)
*Daniel Braun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a bias towards answering 'no' in surveys, opposite to human acquiescence bias where people tend to agree regardless of beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Since LLMs are trained on human data and are influenceable by input changes, researchers wanted to investigate if they exhibit the same acquiescence bias (tendency to agree) that humans show in surveys.

Method: Conducted a study across different LLM models, tasks, and languages (English, German, Polish) to test for acquiescence bias patterns.

Result: Contrary to human behavior, LLMs displayed a consistent bias towards answering 'no' regardless of whether it indicated agreement or disagreement with statements.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit an opposite response pattern to humans in survey-like contexts, showing a systematic 'no' bias rather than the expected acquiescence bias found in human respondents.

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

*Pia Sommerauer,Giulia Rambelli,Tommaso Caselli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona-prompting in LLMs doesn't effectively modulate linguistic abstraction levels, potentially propagating stereotypes even when simulating marginalized groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic abstraction (a marker of stereotyping) when LLMs generate texts about socio-demographic categories with stereotypical/non-stereotypical attributes.

Method: Analyzed outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to generic AI assistant responses. Used Linguistic Expectancy Bias framework and introduced Self-Stereo dataset from Reddit. Measured abstraction through concreteness, specificity, and negation metrics.

Result: Persona-prompting has limited effectiveness in modulating abstraction in language, confirming concerns about personas as representative of socio-demographic groups and showing risk of propagating stereotypes even when simulating marginalized voices.

Conclusion: The study highlights the ecological limitations of persona-prompting for representing social groups and raises concerns about unintentional stereotype propagation through this technique.

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

TL;DR: TrinityX is a modular alignment framework using Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) to optimize LLM outputs across Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty dimensions simultaneously, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods optimize individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. MoE architectures offer modularity but suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting effectiveness in alignment tasks.

Method: Proposes TrinityX framework with separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrated through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into unified alignment-aware representations within Transformer architecture.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 32.5% win rate improvement, 33.9% safety score boost, and 28.4% truthfulness increase on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA benchmarks. Reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE approaches.

Conclusion: TrinityX effectively addresses multi-dimensional alignment challenges through calibrated expert routing, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse LLM backbones while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CM-Align improves multilingual LLM alignment by using consistency-based data selection to create high-quality preference pairs, addressing limitations of current methods that use potentially low-quality English references and biased approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods show performance gap in multilingual alignment due to using potentially low-quality English responses as references and biased/heuristic approaches for constructing preference pairs, leading to noisy data.

Method: Consistency-based data selection with two components: 1) consistency-guided English reference selection, and 2) cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction for DPO training.

Result: Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the method.

Conclusion: The approach shows the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data for improving multilingual alignment performance.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zero-shot LLM ensembles achieve state-of-the-art performance on biomedical Yes/No QA tasks without fine-tuning, outperforming individual models and rivaling domain-specific systems through effective RAG pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical QA requires precise interpretation of specialized knowledge from vast, complex datasets, but traditional approaches need costly fine-tuning and labeled data.

Method: Ensemble approach aggregating outputs from multiple LLM variants (Anthropic and Google models) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, focusing on zero-shot learning without domain-specific tuning.

Result: Ensembles outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems on BioASQ challenge tasks, while maintaining generalizability. Found that expanded contexts can cause information dilution despite providing more evidence.

Conclusion: Ensemble-based zero-shot approaches with effective RAG pipelines provide a practical, scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical QA, with precise retrieval being critical for LLM performance.

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of LLM memorization in medicine, showing it's more prevalent than in general domain and categorized into beneficial, uninformative, and harmful types with practical recommendations for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent and nature of memorization in LLMs applied to medicine, as memorization affects both development and adoption of medical LLMs but remains an open question despite widespread applications.

Method: Systematic analysis of three adaptation scenarios: continued pretraining on medical corpora, fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and fine-tuning on real-world clinical data including 13,000+ inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System.

Result: Memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than in general domain, categorized into three types: beneficial (accurate recall of guidelines/references), uninformative (repeated disclaimers/templates), and harmful (regeneration of sensitive clinical content).

Conclusion: Provides practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization for enhanced reasoning, minimize uninformative memorization for deeper learning, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent patient information leakage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

TL;DR: OTESGN model combines syntactic graph attention and semantic optimal transport attention for aspect-based sentiment analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved noise resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ABSA methods struggle with complex semantic relationships and noisy similarity from irrelevant words, failing to capture nonlinear associations and properly identify key opinion terms.

Method: Proposes Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph Network (OTESGN) with Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative Attention, including Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for global syntax and Semantic Optimal Transport Attention for fine-grained semantic alignments, plus Adaptive Attention Fusion and contrastive regularization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30% F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks compared to previous best models.

Conclusion: OTESGN effectively captures sentiment signals obscured by noise through optimal transport and syntactic-semantic collaboration, demonstrating superior performance in opinion word localization and noise resistance.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

*Hyunjun Kim,Junwoo Ha,Sangyoon Yu,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated framework that evolves multi-turn-to-single-turn red-teaming templates through LLM-guided evolution, achieving 44.8% success rate on GPT-4.1 and demonstrating transferable structural improvements across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior M2S compression methods relied on limited manually written templates, creating a need for automated discovery and optimization of effective red-teaming prompts.

Method: X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S framework using language-model-guided evolution with smart sampling from 12 sources, LLM-as-judge evaluation, and maintaining selection pressure with success threshold θ=0.70.

Result: Achieved 44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1, discovered 5 evolutionary generations and 2 new template families. Cross-model evaluation showed structural gains transfer but vary by target model, with positive correlation between prompt length and success score.

Conclusion: Structure-level search provides reproducible improvement for single-turn red-teaming probes, highlighting the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation for robust results.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are
available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM) is a streaming sequence-to-sequence framework that uses pre-processed delays between multimodal streams to enable efficient streaming inference with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequence-to-sequence models operate offline (complete input before output) or require complex streaming policies. DSM aims to provide a simpler, more flexible streaming approach for multimodal tasks.

Method: DSM models time-aligned streams with decoder-only language models, moving alignment to pre-processing by introducing appropriate delays between input and output streams.

Result: DSM achieves state-of-the-art performance and latency on ASR and TTS tasks, supports arbitrary long sequences, and is competitive with offline baselines.

Conclusion: DSM provides a flexible and effective framework for streaming multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning that simplifies streaming inference while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

*Minyeong Choe,Haehyun Cho,Changho Seo,Hyunil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Qwen models show different factual recall patterns than GPT models - attention modules in early layers contribute more than MLPs, unlike previous findings on GPT-style models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if findings about factual recall mechanisms in GPT models generalize to other autoregressive Transformer architectures like LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of factual recall across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek), analyzing where and how factual information is encoded and accessed.

Result: Qwen-based models behave differently - attention modules in earliest layers contribute more to factual recall than MLP modules, contrary to GPT patterns.

Conclusion: Architectural variations within autoregressive Transformer family lead to fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall, challenging generalization of previous findings.

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CAI Ratio metric for unsupervised evaluation of LLM annotation quality using student-teacher collaboration and majority voting without oracle feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM annotation quality is challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail.

Method: Agentic annotation paradigm where student model collaborates with noisy teacher (LLM) using user preference-based majority voting to assess annotation consistency, introducing CAI Ratio metric.

Result: CAI Ratio shows strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy across ten NLP datasets and four LLMs, enabling robust model selection in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: CAI Ratio is an essential unsupervised evaluation tool for LLM annotation quality and model selection in real-world environments without requiring oracle feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

*Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot,Dren Fazlija,Wolfgang Nejdl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoVoC is a morpheme-aware subword tokenization method that integrates morphological analysis with BPE to preserve morphological boundaries in Geez script languages, showing improved linguistic fidelity despite no significant translation quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological boundaries, which is particularly problematic for low-resource, morphologically complex languages like those using the Geez script.

Method: Developed MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and trained MoVoC-Tok tokenizer that combines morpheme-based segmentation with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to maintain morphological integrity while preserving lexical meaning.

Result: While no significant improvements in automatic translation quality were observed, consistent improvements were seen in intrinsic metrics (MorphoScore and Boundary Precision), demonstrating enhanced linguistic fidelity and token efficiency.

Conclusion: The morphology-aware segmentation approach provides value for low-resource morphologically rich languages, and the released annotated datasets and tokenizer will support further research in this area.

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scalable methods for building high-quality web-based training corpora for non-English languages, demonstrated with a 120B token Portuguese corpus that achieves competitive results through language-specific filtering and preprocessing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for languages other than English, as most existing work focuses on English and there's limited research on multilingual LLM data development.

Method: Developed scalable web-based corpus building methods, applied to create 120B token Portuguese corpus using language-specific filtering pipelines (including STEM classifiers and toxic content detection), and conducted continual pretraining experiments transitioning English-trained models to Portuguese.

Result: The Portuguese corpus achieved competitive results comparable to industrial-grade corpora. Language-specific filtering and preprocessing strategies significantly improved LLM performance when adapting English-trained models to Portuguese.

Conclusion: High-quality, language-specific data is crucial for effective multilingual LLM development. The methods demonstrated for Portuguese are scalable and applicable to other languages, emphasizing the value of targeted data selection and preprocessing strategies.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM hacking refers to systematic biases and errors in research caused by implementation choices when using LLMs for data annotation, leading to incorrect statistical conclusions in approximately one-third to half of hypotheses tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the risk of biased results in social science research when using LLMs for data annotation tasks, as implementation choices can introduce systematic errors that propagate to downstream analyses.

Method: Replicated 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published studies using 18 different LLM models, analyzing 13 million labels and testing 2,361 hypotheses to measure how researcher choices affect statistical conclusions.

Result: Found incorrect conclusions in ~33% of hypotheses for state-of-the-art models and ~50% for smaller models; higher task performance reduces but doesn't eliminate risk; common correction techniques are ineffective; intentional hacking is surprisingly simple.

Conclusion: LLM hacking poses significant risks to research validity, requiring rigorous verification, human annotations for validation, and awareness that even accurate models don't eliminate the risk of biased conclusions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Motivation: RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into reasoning models, but faces challenges in computational resources, algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure that need to be addressed for scaling toward Artificial SuperIntelligence.

Method: Comprehensive review and examination of research applying RL to LLMs and reasoning models, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications since DeepSeek-R1 release.

Result: The survey identifies RL as achieving remarkable success in advancing LLM capabilities for complex logical tasks like mathematics and coding, establishing it as a key methodology for reasoning models.

Conclusion: The review aims to promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models by identifying opportunities and directions in this rapidly evolving field, with the goal of enhancing scalability toward ASI.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly

*Federico Fontana,Anxhelo Diko,Romeo Lanzino,Marco Raoul Marini,Bachir Kaddar,Gian Luca Foresti,Luigi Cinque*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes deepfake detection as a continual learning problem, proposing an efficient framework that adapts to new manipulation techniques while retaining knowledge of past generators, with significant speed improvements but limited future generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generation technologies are evolving rapidly, making traditional detection methods that require frequent retraining impractical and expensive. There's a need for systems that can continuously adapt to new threats while maintaining knowledge of previous ones.

Method: Proposed a continual learning framework that simulates real-world chronological evolution of deepfake technologies over 7 years, using lightweight visual backbones for real-time performance. Introduced two novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) and Forward Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC).

Result: The framework achieved efficient adaptation (155 times faster than full retraining) and robust retention of historical knowledge. However, generalization to future generators without additional training remained near-random (FWT-AUC ≈ 0.5), leading to the Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.

Conclusion: While continual learning enables efficient adaptation to new deepfake technologies with strong historical retention, current approaches cannot generalize to unseen future generators without training, suggesting each generator leaves a unique imprint that requires specific detection models.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why existing unlearnable examples (UEs) fail to maintain cross-task unlearnability, proposes new metrics to quantify unlearnability, and benchmarks current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearnable methods don't work across multiple tasks despite models' powerful learning capabilities, raising questions about true unlearnability.

Method: Analyze model optimization differences between clean and poisoned models, use loss landscape analysis, propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) metric and Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure unlearnability.

Result: Found that UEs still perform well in tasks like semantic segmentation, revealing limitations of existing unlearnable methods.

Conclusion: Proposed SAL and UD metrics help quantify unlearnability boundaries and promote awareness of current method limitations.

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity linking is critical for connecting unstructured text with knowledge graphs, enabling access to curated data. At JPMorgan, news analytics benefits multiple teams with over $2M annual external vendor costs, making efficient entity linking essential for daily operations.

Method: JEL uses a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural network architecture for entity linking, designed to handle the challenge of linking mentions to thousands of potential entities in knowledge graphs.

Result: The model beats current state-of-the-art entity linking models, demonstrating superior performance in accurately linking entities to mentions in textual sources.

Conclusion: JEL provides an effective solution for entity linking that can significantly improve news analytics platforms and reduce reliance on external vendors, offering both technical superiority and practical business value.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative AI in healthcare requires moving beyond quantitative benchmarks to include human expertise and computational models for better generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for generative AI in healthcare rely heavily on quantitative benchmarks, which can suffer from overfitting and lack generalizability across different clinical tasks and environments.

Method: The paper discusses state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies that leverage human expertise and utilize cost-effective computational models as evaluators, rather than relying solely on quantitative benchmarks.

Result: The analysis reveals limitations in current benchmark-based evaluation approaches and highlights the need for more comprehensive assessment strategies that account for real-world clinical implementation variability.

Conclusion: Effective evaluation of generative AI in healthcare requires a multifaceted approach that combines quantitative metrics with human expertise and computational model evaluation to ensure generalizability and practical clinical utility.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

*Lucas Fenaux,Zheng Wang,Jacob Yan,Nathan Chung,Florian Kerschbaum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New adaptive backdoor attack breaks existing FL defenses with just 1-2 malicious clients, while proposed Hammer and Anvil defense (Krum+) successfully counters adaptive attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks from malicious clients, and existing defenses fail against adaptive attackers who can bypass current protection mechanisms.

Method: Devised a new powerful adaptive adversary that requires minimal malicious clients, then created Hammer and Anvil - a principled defense combining two orthogonal defense mechanisms to create robust protection.

Result: The new adaptive attack breaks state-of-the-art defenses with only 1-2 malicious clients out of 20, while the proposed Krum+ defense successfully counters both the new adaptive adversary and existing attacks.

Conclusion: Combining orthogonal defense principles creates robust protection against adaptive backdoor attacks in Federated Learning, with Krum+ demonstrating effectiveness against powerful adversaries.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of

TL;DR: PhysioCLR is a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that incorporates ECG domain knowledge to improve arrhythmia classification with limited labeled data, achieving 12% AUROC improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based ECG analysis is limited by scarce labeled data. Self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, but existing methods lack integration of physiological knowledge, limiting clinical relevance and generalizability.

Method: PhysioCLR uses contrastive learning with ECG physiological similarity cues, ECG-specific augmentations that preserve category information, and a hybrid loss function to learn clinically meaningful representations from unlabeled ECG data.

Result: Evaluated on Chapman, Georgia, and private ICU datasets, PhysioCLR achieved 12% mean AUROC improvement relative to the strongest baseline, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization for multilabel and binary ECG classification.

Conclusion: Integrating physiological knowledge into contrastive learning enables learning of clinically meaningful and transferable ECG features, showing promise for more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics through physiology-informed SSL.

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

*Konstantin Burlachenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes five key challenges in Federated Learning (FL) - data/device heterogeneity, communication issues, and privacy concerns - and proposes novel approaches to bridge theoretical advancements with practical implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL training occurs in decentralized, less controlled environments compared to data centers, creating unique challenges that require addressing the gap between theoretical methods and real-world applicability.

Method: The authors identify five core FL challenges and develop novel approaches that consider both theoretical algorithm design and practical implementation aspects, including a reverse process of adapting practical insights back into theory.

Result: The work advances FL algorithms and systems by creating a framework that translates theoretical methods into efficient real-world implementations while also informing theoretical design through practical perspectives.

Conclusion: This research provides a comprehensive guide for navigating FL complexities, demonstrating that practical implementation insights can reveal new dimensions of algorithms and enhance both theoretical and applied FL development.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Credibility Transformer with in-context learning using similar instances to enhance CLS token representations and improve predictive accuracy, especially for unseen categorical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model learning and predictive performance by incorporating additional context from similar instances, enabling better adaptation to risk patterns and generalization to new categorical feature levels not seen during training.

Method: Augments the Credibility Transformer architecture with an in-context learning mechanism that uses a context batch of similar instances to enhance CLS token representations through additional information and fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical verification shows enhanced predictive accuracy through adaptation to similar risk patterns and improved generalization to new instances with previously unseen categorical feature levels.

Conclusion: In-context learning successfully enhances the Credibility Transformer's performance by leveraging similar instances, providing better predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities for novel categorical features.

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

TL;DR: A framework combining LLMs with multi-model ML architecture for rare event prediction, achieving 9.8X-11.1X precision over random baseline in VC startup evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting rare, high-impact outcomes in domains like Venture Capital where investors must make decisions with limited and noisy early-stage data, requiring both predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Integrates LLM-powered feature engineering to extract signals from unstructured data, uses layered ensemble of models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression) to produce continuous success likelihood estimates, then thresholds for binary rare-event prediction.

Result: Strong performance with precision 9.8X-11.1X random classifier baseline across three test subsets. Feature analysis shows startup category (15.6% influence) and founder count as top predictors, with education and domain expertise having smaller consistent effects.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines black-box model strength with interpretability for reliable rare-event prediction, demonstrating practical value in VC startup evaluation through both high performance and interpretable success drivers.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing performance and fairness in classification, particularly with intersectional biases and conflicting fairness definitions, amid growing regulatory demands for equitable AI.

Method: Leverages boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically optimize model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse fairness violations, supporting multi-objective optimization.

Result: Enables users to deploy context-specific fair models while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: mmm-fair provides a comprehensive open-source solution combining multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, no-code interface, LLM explanations, and deployment-ready models - a unique combination in fairness tools.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

*Ho Ming Lee,Katrien Antonio,Benjamin Avanzi,Lorenzo Marchi,Rui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distance covariance regularization framework for achieving demographic parity fairness in regression and classification tasks, addressing multiple protected attributes and fairness gerrymandering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods focus on binary classification and fail to handle continuous attributes or multiple protected attributes simultaneously, often ignoring intersectional subgroup disparities (fairness gerrymandering).

Method: Proposed distance covariance regularization to mitigate association between predictions and protected attributes. Extended framework with two multivariate dependence measures: joint distance covariance (JdCov) and novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov). Includes regularization calibration using Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Result: Framework effectively addresses fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks with various protected attribute types. Applied successfully to COMPAS recidivism dataset and large motor insurance claims dataset.

Conclusion: The distance covariance regularization approach provides an effective solution for achieving demographic parity across multiple protected attributes, including continuous ones, while preventing fairness gerrymandering in intersectional subgroups.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARLINE is a novel multi-source transfer learning approach that handles concept drift in data streams by projecting target concepts to source concept spaces, enabling ensemble predictions even when source and target concepts don't match.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches assume at least one source model matches the target concept, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. There's a need for methods that can benefit from multiple sources even when concepts don't align.

Method: Projects target concept to each source concept space, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers to contribute to predictions through an ensemble approach in non-stationary environments.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets showed MARLINE achieved higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data stream learning approaches.

Conclusion: MARLINE effectively handles concept drift by leveraging multiple data sources without requiring source-target concept matching, demonstrating superior performance in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift independently or in relation to other labels, and transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate adaptation, but research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams remains limited.

Method: Proposed two methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE extends this by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance learning performance.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show that both methods outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary environments.

Conclusion: The methods demonstrate the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer for improved predictive performance in multi-label data streams with concept drift.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers learn to dynamically handle varying causal structures through Selective Induction Heads that identify correct lags and copy tokens from context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies use fixed Markov chains to analyze induction heads, but natural language has dynamic causal relationships that change with context, requiring more flexible mechanisms.

Method: Proposed framework with interleaved Markov chains of different lags but fixed transition probabilities. Constructed 3-layer transformer to implement Selective Induction Heads that identify correct causal structure.

Result: Transformers learn to predict next tokens by selecting the correct lag and copying corresponding tokens from past context. The mechanism asymptotically converges to maximum likelihood solution.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of how transformers select causal structures dynamically, providing new insights into transformer functioning and interpretability through Selective Induction Heads.

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study compares WGAN-GP and diffusion models for generating realistic EEG artifact segments for data augmentation, finding WGAN-GP achieves better spectral alignment but both models have weak class-conditional recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG artifacts are costly to label at scale and confound automated analysis, so researchers want to use generative models to synthesize realistic artifact segments for augmentation and stress-testing.

Method: Used TUH EEG Artifact corpus with subject-wise splits and fixed-length windows. Compared conditional WGAN-GP with projection discriminator to 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance. Evaluated fidelity, specificity, and utility metrics.

Result: WGAN-GP achieved closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data. Both models exhibited weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and reveals opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage in future generative models for EEG artifacts.

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

TL;DR: A new method for improving reduced-order models (ROMs) for PDEs by introducing a flexible finite-difference scheme and Rollout loss to maintain accuracy over long time horizons, demonstrated on 2D Burgers equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving complex partial differential equations are computationally expensive, and while reduced-order models offer faster approximations, their predictive accuracy degrades significantly over long time periods.

Method: The approach combines (1) a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme with (2) a novel Rollout loss function that trains ROMs to maintain accuracy over arbitrary time horizons.

Result: The method was successfully demonstrated on the 2D Burgers equation, showing improved predictive performance over extended time periods compared to conventional ROM approaches.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution to the long-standing problem of predictive degradation in reduced-order models for PDEs, enabling more accurate and efficient long-term simulations of complex physical systems.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular framework called Prescribe-then-Select (PS) that constructs a library of candidate policies and learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for given covariates in contextual stochastic optimization problems with hard constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In contextual stochastic optimization, multiple candidate policies from different modeling paradigms show heterogeneous performance across covariate space, with no single policy uniformly dominating others.

Method: PS framework first builds a library of feasible candidate policies, then learns a meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy Trees trained via cross-validation to select the best policy for observed covariates.

Result: PS consistently outperforms the best single policy in heterogeneous covariate regimes and converges to the dominant policy when heterogeneity is absent, across newsvendor and shipment planning problems.

Conclusion: The Prescribe-then-Select framework provides an effective data-driven approach for policy selection in contextual stochastic optimization with hard constraints, adapting to heterogeneous performance across covariate space.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

### [125] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM) combines gradient compression sketching with Gaussian noise for federated learning, providing stronger privacy guarantees than isolated approaches while maintaining communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for both communication efficiency and privacy in federated learning by jointly analyzing sketching and Gaussian mechanisms rather than treating them separately.

Method: Introduces SGM that directly combines sketching (for compression) with Gaussian noise (for privacy), uses Rényi-DP for joint privacy analysis, and applies it to FL with gradient descent or adaptive optimizers.

Result: SGM provides privacy proportional to 1/√b (where b is sketching dimension), offering stronger privacy than original GM with same noise. Experiments show competitive or superior performance to non-sketching private FL variants.

Conclusion: SGM enables more flexible and sharper privacy analysis, achieves better privacy-utility trade-offs, and works effectively with adaptive server optimization while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed

*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAPM is a pruning-based method that uses task vector overlap with pre-trained parameters to quantify catastrophic forgetting, achieving minimal forgetting (0.25%) while maintaining high downstream task accuracy (99.67%) without modifying training or architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models suffer from catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, which degrades their performance on original capabilities while adapting to new tasks.

Method: Proposes Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM) that uses the ratio of task vectors to pre-trained parameters as a pruning criterion to balance catastrophic forgetting and downstream performance, requiring no training modifications or auxiliary data.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 diverse datasets show FAPM limits catastrophic forgetting to only 0.25% while maintaining 99.67% accuracy on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FAPM effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting through a novel pruning approach that leverages task vector analysis, providing a simple yet powerful solution without architectural changes or additional data requirements.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Motivation: Accurate rainfall forecasting is crucial for flood management, hydropower operation, and disaster preparedness in Vietnam's diverse climatic conditions with strong geographical variability.

Method: Matrix Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE) - a regime-switching framework that dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model forecasts with redundancy-aware weighting.

Result: MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines across eight major basins and multiple forecast horizons.

Conclusion: The proposed MPWE framework demonstrates improved accuracy and stability in rainfall forecasting across diverse Vietnamese river basins and various time horizons.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based AMR models require massive labeled data, making repeated training and hyperparameter tuning time-consuming and energy-intensive.

Method: Records prediction trajectories during full training, constructs three importance metrics based on training dynamics to select a representative coreset.

Result: Maintains high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization using only 1%-30% of original data across multiple AMR datasets.

Conclusion: FoQuS effectively reduces training overhead while preserving model performance, making AMR development more efficient.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of

\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvolKV is an adaptive framework that uses evolutionary search to optimize layer-wise KV cache compression, achieving better performance than heuristic methods while using significantly less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods rely on heuristics that ignore layer-specific feature patterns and task performance interactions, leading to degraded generalization.

Method: Reformulates cache allocation as multi-objective optimization problem and uses evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while maximizing downstream performance.

Result: Outperforms all baseline methods on 11 tasks, achieves up to 7% improvement on GSM8K, and surpasses full KV cache performance on code completion using only 1.5% of original budget.

Conclusion: EvolKV demonstrates the untapped potential of learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation, showing that adaptive optimization can significantly improve both memory efficiency and task performance.

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM tutoring accelerates RL convergence while maintaining optimal performance, with advice reuse further reducing training time but causing less stable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL algorithms require long training in complex environments with sparse rewards, and existing acceleration techniques are domain-specific and require expert knowledge.

Method: Used student-teacher architecture with pre-trained LLMs (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek) as tutors for RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C) across environments (Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four) with 54 configurations, testing LLM-generated guidance and advice reuse.

Result: LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance. Advice reuse further improves training duration but results in less stable convergence dynamics.

Conclusion: LLM tutoring generally improves RL convergence, with effectiveness depending on specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

TL;DR: MoEpic is an efficient MoE inference system that vertically splits experts into top/bottom segments to improve cache hit rates and reduce loading latency, achieving significant GPU cost savings and latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures for large language models impose heavy GPU memory demands, hindering widespread adoption. Existing offloading approaches suffer from poor cache hit rates and substantial expert loading latency during inference.

Method: Proposes MoEpic with expert split mechanism - vertically divides each expert into top and bottom segments. Caches top segments of hot experts to improve cache hit rate. Predicts and prefetches activated experts for next layer. Uses divide-and-conquer algorithm for adaptive cache configuration.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoEpic saves about half of GPU cost while lowering inference latency by 37.51%-65.73% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MoEpic effectively addresses GPU memory constraints in MoE inference through expert segmentation and intelligent prefetching, enabling more efficient deployment of large MoE language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a gradient perturbation method that combines prediction and decision loss gradients to improve decision-focused learning stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) optimizes prediction accuracy but ignores downstream decision quality, while decision-focused learning (DFL) directly optimizes decisions but suffers from unstable convergence due to flat-and-sharp loss landscapes.

Method: Perturbs decision loss gradient using prediction loss gradient with sigmoid-like decaying parameter, requiring no additional training and compatible with any DFL solvers.

Result: Achieves lower regret with more stable training across three stochastic optimization problems, outperforming PFL and DFL baselines even in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient perturbation approach effectively combines the stability of PFL with the decision quality focus of DFL, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replacing FFREEDA backbone with frozen vision foundation models improves accuracy and reduces costs in class-imbalanced federated learning without complex parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address class imbalances in both source and target domains, label shifts between domains and clients in federated learning scenarios where target data remains unlabeled.

Method: Replace FFREEDA backbone with frozen vision foundation model (VFM) instead of enhancing aggregation and domain adaptation methods.

Result: VFMs effectively mitigate domain gaps, class imbalances, and non-IID-ness among target clients, improving overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Strong feature extractors (VFMs) are more important than complex adaptation or FL methods for success in real-world federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

TL;DR: Cutmax enables efficient encrypted text generation by providing HE-friendly argmax and sampling methods with 24x-35x speedup over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns with LLMs processing sensitive data on untrusted servers, and performance bottlenecks of non-polynomial decoding methods under homomorphic encryption.

Method: Introduces cutmax (HE-friendly argmax algorithm) and first HE-compatible nucleus sampling method, both polynomial and differentiable for efficient encrypted inference.

Result: Achieves 24x-35x latency reduction over baseline methods while maintaining provable privacy guarantees for secure text generation.

Conclusion: Cutmax enables practical privacy-preserving text generation with significant performance improvements and strong theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

TL;DR: MoT addresses domain generalization conflicts in graph foundation models by introducing Information Tinker and Regularization Tinker components to prevent model degradation and representation collapse, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph foundation models suffer from domain generalization conflicts that cause imperceptible pitfalls - model degradation where encoder/codebook fail to capture input diversity, and representation collapse where embeddings lose semantic separability due to narrow representation subspaces.

Method: Proposes MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) with: (1) Information Tinker using edge-wise semantic fusion and mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity, (2) Regularization Tinker with two additional regularizations to improve gradient supervision.

Result: Experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains show MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MoT effectively addresses information bottleneck and regularization deficit challenges in graph foundation models, adheres to scaling laws, and provides a flexible architecture with controllable model scale for cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Method: Used a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2 VLM and benchmarked it against state-of-the-art CNN architectures similar to those used in NOvA and DUNE experiments.

Result: VLMs outperformed CNNs in classification performance while providing greater flexibility for integrating auxiliary information and more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions.

Conclusion: VLMs show strong potential as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

### [141] [An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for General Insurance Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08467)
*Patrick J. Laub,Tu Pho,Bernard Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANAM is an interpretable deep learning model for insurance pricing that uses separate neural networks for each covariate and interaction term, maintaining predictive power while providing full transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional actuarial methods' interpretability and neural networks' predictive power, creating a model that offers both transparency and strong performance for insurance pricing applications.

Method: Assigns dedicated neural networks to each covariate and pairwise interaction term with architectural constraints for interpretability (sparsity, smoothness, monotonicity), grounded in a mathematical framework for insurance interpretability.

Result: Outperforms traditional actuarial and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in most cases on both synthetic and real insurance datasets while maintaining complete transparency.

Conclusion: The Actuarial Neural Additive Model successfully combines neural networks' predictive capabilities with full interpretability, making it suitable for practical insurance pricing applications where transparency is essential.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

### [142] [SHAining on Process Mining: Explaining Event Log Characteristics Impact on Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08482)
*Andrea Maldonado,Christian M. M. Frey,Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula,Ludwig Zellner,Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAining is the first approach to quantify how different event log characteristics affect process mining algorithm metrics, analyzing over 22,000 logs to identify which characteristics most impact performance across fitness, precision, and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing process mining evaluations lack systematic analysis of how specific event log characteristics impact algorithm performance, and fail to account for characteristic co-occurrence in real-world processes.

Method: Introduces SHAining to measure marginal contributions of event log characteristics, analyzing over 22,000 event logs covering diverse characteristics using process discovery as downstream task.

Result: Identifies which event log characteristics most significantly affect algorithm metrics across fitness, precision, and complexity, and provides insights on characteristic value correlation with impact.

Conclusion: The approach offers novel understanding of algorithm robustness by quantifying characteristic contributions, addressing a gap in process mining evaluation methodology.

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

*Minqi Jiang,João G. M. Araújo,Will Ellsworth,Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDR framework uses generative models to transform datasets with undesirable content into refined training data, addressing data scarcity while maintaining privacy and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training data is becoming scarce as web data growth can't keep up with model training needs, and user-generated content contains privacy risks and undesirable content.

Method: Generative Data Refinement (GDR) uses pretrained generative models to conditionally transform problematic datasets into safe, diverse synthetic data that matches web-scale dataset characteristics.

Result: GDR outperforms industry-grade anonymization solutions, enables detoxification of unsafe datasets, and naturally produces diverse synthetic data without complex prompting.

Conclusion: GDR provides a simple yet effective solution to scale training data for frontier models by safely leveraging user-generated content while avoiding privacy leaks and undesirable content.

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

*Matias D. Cattaneo,Boris Shigida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum is equivalent to plain gradient descent with a modified loss on attractive manifolds, with precise approximation bounds and combinatorial analysis revealing hidden polynomial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mathematical foundations of heavy-ball momentum optimization and provide rigorous approximation bounds for its behavior compared to plain gradient descent.

Method: Prove equivalence between HB momentum and modified-loss gradient descent on invariant manifolds, conduct combinatorial analysis of memoryless approximations, derive continuous modified equations with arbitrary approximation order, and analyze both full-batch and mini-batch variants.

Result: Established global approximation bounds O(h^R) for any finite order R≥2, discovered rich polynomial families (Eulerian and Narayana) in the combinatorics, derived continuous modified equations with rigorous bounds, and generalized principal flow approximations.

Conclusion: The analysis provides new insights into heavy-ball momentum optimization, reveals hidden mathematical structures, and establishes a framework for similar analysis of other optimization algorithms with rigorous approximation guarantees.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AgentGym-RL is a new reinforcement learning framework for training LLM agents from scratch without supervised fine-tuning, featuring modular architecture and supporting diverse real-world scenarios with a novel ScalingInter-RL training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a unified interactive RL framework that can effectively train autonomous LLM agents from scratch across diverse environments without relying on supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Introduces AgentGym-RL framework with modular architecture and ScalingInter-RL approach that balances exploration-exploitation by gradually increasing interaction horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies.

Result: Agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments, demonstrating stability and effectiveness of both the framework and training approach.

Conclusion: The framework enables development of more diverse and stable autonomous agents, with plans to open-source the complete system to empower research community in developing next-generation intelligent agents.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

### [146] [Heart Disease Prediction: A Comparative Study of Optimisers Performance in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08499)
*Chisom Chibuike,Adeyinka Ogunsanya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of 10 optimizers for heart disease prediction using MLP, finding RMSProp most effective with balanced performance across metrics like precision (0.765), recall (0.827), and AUC (0.841).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of systematic approach for optimizer selection in deep learning training, need to understand how optimizers perform based on different evaluation metrics.

Method: Evaluated 10 optimizers on MLP model with heart disease dataset using consistent training paradigm, measuring convergence speed, stability, AUC, precision, and recall.

Result: Trade-offs between convergence speed and stability observed. RMSProp performed best overall with 0.765 precision, 0.827 recall, 0.841 AUC, and faster training time, though not the most stable.

Conclusion: Recommend thorough optimizer evaluation in less compute-constrained environments to improve scientific rigor and model performance in deep learning training.

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

*Alicia Tierz,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining VRRAEs and DeepONets for generative thermal design that addresses computational cost and latent space discontinuity issues in conventional generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of thermal simulations and limitations of conventional generative models (AEs/VAEs) that produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, restricting design exploration and physically consistent solutions.

Method: Combines Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). VRRAE uses truncated SVD for continuous, interpretable latent representations, while DeepONet uses the compact encoding for efficient temperature gradient prediction.

Result: Enhanced quality of generated geometries, improved gradient prediction accuracy, and substantial inference efficiency advantages over traditional numerical solvers.

Conclusion: Structured latent representations are crucial for operator learning, and combining generative models with operator networks shows great potential for thermal design and broader engineering applications.

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-based active clustering algorithm using sparse graphs to improve efficiency, reduce computational costs, and minimize user annotation requirements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient and scalable pairwise constraint-based active clustering for large-scale data processing in applications like data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model pre-training.

Method: Uses two sparse graphs: one for representing data relationships (data skeleton) and another for updating the data skeleton, working together to refine connected subgraphs and create nested clusters.

Result: Empirical analysis shows the algorithm achieves more accurate clustering with dramatically fewer user-provided constraints, outperforms counterparts in computational performance and scalability, and maintains robustness across various distance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach successfully addresses efficiency, scalability, and annotation reduction goals while delivering superior clustering performance.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT) is a lightweight framework that efficiently distills reasoning capabilities from multiple teachers into compact students by alternating teacher-specific fine-tuning and weight-space merging, achieving superior performance with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning distillation assumes a single oracle teacher, but multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora are practically available. Different students have different "best teachers," and the best teacher can vary across datasets for the same student.

Method: MoT alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities while overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision.

Result: On competition math benchmarks using only ~200 high-quality CoT samples, MoT applied to Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1. It consistently outperforms single-teacher distillation and naive multi-teacher union, mitigates overfitting, shows robustness to distribution shifts, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and improves general reasoning beyond mathematics.

Conclusion: MoT provides a simple, scalable route to efficiently distill long chain-of-thought capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students, with consensus-filtered reasoning features transferring broadly across domains.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Conclusion: MAESTRO presents a powerful unified framework demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting, with publicly available modular pipeline.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web

spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.

TL;DR: Interpretability should be a core design principle for AI alignment, not just a diagnostic tool, as mechanistic approaches provide causal insights into internal failures that behavioral methods may miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large neural models deployed in high-stakes settings raise concerns about reliable alignment with human values, requiring internal transparency through interpretability.

Method: Advocates treating mechanistic interpretability approaches (circuit tracing, activation patching) as primary alignment methods rather than post-hoc correlational techniques like LIME or SHAP.

Result: Mechanistic interpretability provides causal insight into internal failures including deceptive reasoning that behavioral methods (RLHF, red teaming, Constitutional AI) may overlook.

Conclusion: Progress on safe and trustworthy AI depends on making interpretability a first-class objective to ensure systems are auditable, transparent, and aligned with human intent.

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

TL;DR: Comparison of deep learning vs classical machine learning for classifying 24-hour movement behaviors from wrist accelerometer data, showing DL with raw signals performs slightly better (80-85% accuracy) than feature-based methods (70-81% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether deep learning algorithms using raw acceleration signals outperform classical machine learning methods with handcrafted features for classifying sleep, sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

Method: Used data from 151 adults wearing wrist accelerometers. Compared 4 DL algorithms (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN) trained on raw signals and handcrafted features against 6 classical ML algorithms (RF, SVM, XGBoost, LR, ANN, DT) trained on 104 handcrafted features. Data split into training (121), validation (15), and test (15) sets with 10-second non-overlapping windows.

Result: DL algorithms with raw signals achieved 80-85% overall accuracy, while both DL and classical ML with handcrafted features achieved 70-81% accuracy. Higher confusion occurred between MVPA and LPA classifications compared to sleep and sedentary categories.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods using raw acceleration signals showed only slightly better performance than both DL and classical ML methods trained with handcrafted features for predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities.

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

TL;DR: XNNTab is an interpretable neural architecture for tabular data that uses sparse autoencoders to learn semantically meaningful features, achieving performance comparable to black-box models while providing full interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data applications in finance and healthcare require both high predictive performance and interpretability, but current DNNs for tabular data are blackboxes with little interpretability.

Method: Uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to learn a dictionary of monosemantic features in the latent space, then applies automated methods to assign human-interpretable semantics to these features, representing predictions as linear combinations of meaningful components.

Result: Empirical evaluations show XNNTab achieves performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art black-box neural models and classical machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: XNNTab provides a fully interpretable neural architecture for tabular data that maintains competitive predictive performance while offering transparent, semantically meaningful explanations for predictions.

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear

### [154] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to derive data-dependent upper bounds for silhouette width, providing more realistic and attainable quality metrics for clustering evaluation than the standard theoretical maximum of 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard silhouette coefficient upper limit of 1 is often unattainable in practice, making it difficult to assess how close a clustering result is to the optimal outcome for a specific dataset.

Method: The authors derive sharp upper bounds for each data point's silhouette width based on the dataset characteristics, then aggregate these individual bounds to create a canonical data-dependent upper bound for the average silhouette width.

Result: The proposed bounds are provably near-tight across synthetic and real datasets, often assuming values well below 1, and significantly enrich cluster quality evaluation by providing realistic, dataset-specific quality metrics.

Conclusion: These data-dependent upper bounds enable better assessment of clustering quality, indicate whether individual points can be well-placed, allow for early stopping in optimization loops, and help determine how close a clustering result is to the best possible outcome for a given dataset.

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

*Eric Eaton,Marcel Hussing,Michael Kearns,Aaron Roth,Sikata Bela Sengupta,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First provably efficient replicable reinforcement learning algorithms for linear function approximation, addressing the challenge of result replication in ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replication of experimental results is a major challenge in machine learning, especially in reinforcement learning where algorithms are known to be unstable. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular RL, extending these guarantees to practical function approximation settings remained an open problem.

Method: Developed replicable methods for linear function approximation in RL. Introduced two efficient algorithms for replicable random design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, then leveraged these tools to create replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both generative model and episodic settings.

Result: Successfully developed the first provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear MDPs. Experimental evaluation showed these algorithms can inspire more consistent neural policies.

Conclusion: This work makes significant progress in addressing replicability challenges in RL by providing the first efficient replicable algorithms for linear function approximation settings, with practical implications for developing more consistent neural policies.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

### [156] [Signal Fidelity Index-Aware Calibration for Dementia Predictions Across Heterogeneous Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08679)
*Jingya Cheng,Jiazi Tian,Federica Spoto,Alaleh Azhir,Daniel Mork,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) to quantify diagnostic data quality in dementia EHRs and SFI-aware calibration to improve ML model performance across healthcare systems without outcome labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models trained on EHRs degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional shift, particularly diagnostic signal decay - variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions.

Method: Built simulation framework with 2,500 synthetic datasets. Derived SFI from six components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory stability. Applied SFI-aware calibration with multiplicative adjustment optimized across simulation batches.

Result: At optimal parameter (α=2.0), SFI-aware calibration significantly improved all metrics (p<0.001): 10.3% Balanced Accuracy, 32.5% Recall, 31.9% Precision, 26.1% F1-score. Performance approached reference standards with substantial improvements.

Conclusion: Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides practical, label-free strategy to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, especially for administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

### [157] [Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08683)
*Delio Jaramillo-Velez,Charul Rajput,Ragnar Freij-Hollanti,Camilla Hollanti,Alexandre Graell i Amat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel secure aggregation method for federated learning using torus instead of finite fields, achieving perfect privacy without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in federated learning by preventing information leakage from local models while maintaining model accuracy, overcoming limitations of finite field approaches that suffer from accuracy-complexity tradeoffs.

Method: Proposes secure parameter aggregation using the torus (rather than finite fields) which provides uniform distribution for masking operations, enabling perfect privacy protection while avoiding accuracy losses associated with fixed-point modular arithmetic.

Result: Experimental results show the torus-based protocol performs similarly to non-secure aggregation models while maintaining perfect privacy, and significantly outperforms finite field secure aggregation in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity in some cases.

Conclusion: Torus-based secure aggregation provides a safer choice for federated learning by guaranteeing perfect privacy without sacrificing model accuracy, making it superior to finite field approaches.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

*James Gong,Raymond Luo,Emma Wang,Leon Ge,Bruce Li,Felix Marattukalam,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAUST integrates Forward-Forward algorithm with similarity learning to eliminate multiple forward passes during inference, improving accuracy while maintaining biological plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation has biological implausibility issues like backward locking and global error propagation. Forward-Forward algorithm offers biological plausibility but suffers from accuracy gaps and inefficient inference requiring multiple forward passes.

Method: Proposed FAUST algorithm that combines Forward-Forward with similarity-based tuplet loss frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward passes during inference while maintaining the biological plausibility benefits.

Result: FAUST substantially improves accuracy on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. On CIFAR-10, achieved 56.22% accuracy with MLP, approaching backpropagation's 57.63% benchmark.

Conclusion: FAUST successfully bridges the accuracy gap between Forward-Forward and backpropagation while eliminating inference inefficiency, making biologically plausible training more practical and competitive.

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three-layered architecture for log analysis in AIOps: autonomous log labeling and anomaly classification, flexible anomaly detection with high F1-scores, and root cause analysis that identifies 90-98% of root causes in top 10 candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing complexity challenges DevOps teams face in maintaining system stability and reliability through effective log analysis methods.

Method: Three-layered architecture: 1) Log Investigation with autonomous labeling and anomaly taxonomy, 2) Anomaly Detection adaptable to different training modes, 3) Root Cause Analysis that identifies minimal log sets and key services.

Result: Achieved F1-scores between 0.98-1.0 for anomaly detection, and consistently detected 90-98% of root cause log lines within top 10 candidates.

Conclusion: The integrated three-layer architecture provides DevOps teams with robust methods to efficiently resolve failures and enhance IT system reliability through optimized log analysis.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

*Nikasadat Emami,Amirhossein Khalilian-Gourtani,Jianghao Qian,Antoine Ratouchniak,Xupeng Chen,Yao Wang,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models using ECoG data can predict speech-critical brain regions with high accuracy, matching ESM performance without being invasive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) is invasive and time-consuming for identifying speech-critical brain regions during presurgical evaluation. Non-invasive alternatives are needed.

Method: Analyzed ECoG data from 16 participants performing speech tasks. Developed classification models combining neural activity signals, anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features. Used trial-level RBF-kernel SVM with MLP-based aggregation for electrode classification.

Result: Best model achieved ROC-AUC: 0.87 and PR-AUC: 0.57 on held-out participants. Models combining region and connectivity features outperformed single-feature models and matched full feature set performance.

Conclusion: Combining spatial and network information with non-linear modeling improves functional mapping for presurgical evaluation, offering a less invasive alternative to ESM.

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

### [161] [Securing Private Federated Learning in a Malicious Setting: A Scalable TEE-Based Approach with Client Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08709)
*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel server extension using ephemeral TEEs to achieve maliciously secure DP-FTRL in federated learning, providing verifiable proofs with minimal client overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-FTRL approaches assume semi-honest servers and cannot handle client dropouts or corruption. TEEs alone introduce forking attacks and availability issues due to state management problems.

Method: Introduces a trusted computing base (TCB) implemented with ephemeral TEE modules on the server to produce verifiable proofs of server actions. Selected clients audit these proofs with small additional communication and computational demands.

Result: Formal proofs demonstrate privacy guarantees in malicious settings. Experimental results show the framework adds only small constant overhead to clients in realistic settings.

Conclusion: The solution reduces TCB size while maintaining system scalability and liveness, enabling practical maliciously secure DP-FTRL without the limitations of traditional TEE implementations.

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid pruning framework combining channel and layer pruning to compress CNN models, reducing complexity and latency on edge devices with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size and complexity of CNNs pose deployment challenges on edge devices, requiring effective model compression techniques.

Method: Proposes a hybrid pruning approach inspired by EfficientNet, applying reverse scaling principles through combined channel and layer pruning.

Result: Experiments showed significant complexity reduction with minimal accuracy degradation, resulting in reduced latency on NVIDIA JETSON TX2 devices.

Conclusion: The hybrid pruning framework effectively compresses CNN models for edge deployment while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

TL;DR: SAPO is a decentralized asynchronous RL algorithm for post-training language models that enables scalable reinforcement learning across heterogeneous compute networks without centralized bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL post-training for language models requires significant parallelization with high technical challenges and costs. There's a need for a decentralized approach that can scale efficiently across diverse hardware.

Method: SAPO uses a fully decentralized network where each node manages its own policy models and shares rollouts with others. No assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware are required, enabling asynchronous operation.

Result: SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments. It was successfully tested on a network with thousands of nodes running on diverse hardware during an open-source demo.

Conclusion: SAPO provides an effective decentralized solution for RL post-training that avoids scaling bottlenecks while enabling knowledge propagation across heterogeneous networks, making RL more accessible and scalable.

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

*Xuefeng Gao,Jiale Zha,Xun Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion model-based approach for generating SDE sample paths without requiring explicit drift/diffusion coefficients, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing financial portfolio optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating stochastic differential equations require explicit specification of drift and diffusion coefficients, which can be limiting when these parameters are unknown. The paper aims to develop a model-free, data-driven alternative using generative AI.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic sample paths from finite sets of observed SDE paths. The approach is model-free and data-driven, requiring only sample path data rather than explicit coefficient specifications.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness through simulation experiments, outperforming benchmark methods including neural SDEs. Empirical study shows synthetic paths enhance reinforcement learning performance for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection.

Conclusion: Diffusion models show promising applications in financial analysis and decision-making, providing a powerful alternative to traditional SDE simulation methods that can improve portfolio optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep equilibrium model approach that recycles intermediate neural network features from previous time steps in molecular dynamics simulations, improving accuracy and speed by 10-20% while being more memory efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the continuous nature of molecular dynamics simulations where successive states are extremely similar, which hasn't been explored as prior information compared to other symmetries like rotation and translation.

Method: Recast a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium model to recycle intermediate neural network features from previous time steps.

Result: Achieved 10-20% improvements in both accuracy and speed on MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets compared to the non-DEQ base model, with much more memory efficient training.

Conclusion: The deep equilibrium model approach successfully leverages the temporal continuity in molecular dynamics simulations, enabling more expressive models on larger systems with improved performance.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemBOMAS is an LLM-enhanced multi-agent system that combines knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization with data-driven fine-grained optimization to significantly accelerate Bayesian optimization in chemistry, achieving 96% optimal objective in real-world experiments compared to experts' 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization in chemistry is hindered by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms, requiring a more efficient approach to accelerate chemical discovery.

Method: Uses LLMs to decompose search space through knowledge reasoning (coarse-grained optimization), then enhances BO with pseudo-data generation in candidate regions (fine-grained optimization) through a multi-agent system.

Result: Achieved 96% optimal objective in wet-lab experiments under pharmaceutical protocols, significantly outperforming domain experts (15%) and various BO algorithms in benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS is a powerful tool that significantly enhances optimization effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating practical utility for accelerating chemical discovery in real-world applications.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms haven't been systematically evaluated under practical edge device constraints with diverse resource limitations, lacking quantitative analysis on various data scenarios and performance metrics.

Method: Constructed PracMHBench platform to classify and test diverse model heterogeneity algorithms on multiple data tasks and metrics under different edge device constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments were performed to observe algorithm applicability and corresponding heterogeneity patterns under various edge constraints.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive re-evaluation of model-heterogeneous FL paradigm through systematic benchmarking, offering insights into practical applicability of different algorithms under real-world edge device limitations.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

*Mominul Rubel,Adam Meyers,Gabriel Nicolosi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLM is a novel neural network architecture that represents multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier series using cosine activations, learning frequencies, amplitudes and phase shifts as trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a neural network architecture that can represent complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions using standard MLP-like structure, overcoming limitations of previous Fourier-inspired models.

Method: Simple feedforward network with cosine activation functions that learns frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts as trainable parameters to create problem-specific spectral basis.

Result: FLM demonstrates one-to-one correspondence between Fourier coefficients and amplitudes/phase-shifts, and shows comparable or superior performance to SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs on PDEs and optimal control problems.

Conclusion: FLM successfully represents complete multidimensional Fourier basis, provides mathematical correspondence with traditional Fourier analysis, and delivers strong performance on scientific computing problems.

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

TL;DR: ADHDeepNet is a deep learning model that achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.17%) in ADHD diagnosis using EEG signals with comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization and explainability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early ADHD diagnosis is crucial but labor-intensive. The paper aims to improve diagnosis precision and timeliness using deep learning and EEG signals to address the challenges in current diagnostic methods.

Method: Developed ADHDeepNet - a DL model with temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques for EEG signals. Used nested cross-validation (10-fold cross-subject validation with inner 2-fold CV), Additive Gaussian Noise for data augmentation, and analyzed model weights and activation patterns for explainability.

Result: Achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD vs healthy controls. Successfully identified key brain regions and frequency bands important for ADHD diagnosis through model explainability analysis.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the strong potential of deep learning combined with EEG signals for highly accurate and efficient ADHD diagnosis, with excellent performance and interpretable results.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Synthesizes current innovations organized around four functional areas: hive condition monitoring, bee behavior recognition, pest/disease detection, and swarming forecasting. Examines datasets, lightweight models, and benchmarking strategies.

Result: Identifies critical limitations including data scarcity, generalization challenges, and deployment barriers in off-grid environments. Highlights emerging opportunities in efficient inference, adaptive learning, and dataset standardization.

Conclusion: Provides foundation for scalable AI-driven monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator management through consolidated research and engineering practices.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things

directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.

TL;DR: RAPID is a two-stage hybrid framework using NV centers for covert EM signal detection below classical noise floor, combining quantum Fisher information with deep reinforcement learning for adaptive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop quantum sensors for security-critical applications like electronic warfare and covert surveillance by overcoming classical noise limitations and enabling operation below the classical noise floor.

Method: Two-stage approach: first computes robust non-adaptive baseline using quantum Fisher information matrix, then uses this to warm-start an online adaptive policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic) to dynamically optimize control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement bases.

Result: Achieves significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and enables coherent quantum beamforming with Heisenberg-like scaling in precision for sensor arrays.

Conclusion: Establishes a theoretically rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in security-critical applications, demonstrating superior performance through hybrid quantum-classical optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of
covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach,
named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust
adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint
detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem,
optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical
constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust,
non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information
matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive
policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method
dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement
bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian
noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol
achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high
estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to
sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves
Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically
rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in
security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert
surveillance.

Motivation: Need for expressive yet hardware-efficient quantum circuit architectures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices

Method: Prompt-based framework using large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology with iterative feedback refinement

Result: LLM-generated ansatze are significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to standard baseline on real IBM quantum hardware using 12 qubits

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical utility of LLM-driven quantum architecture search for robust, deployable generative models on near-term quantum devices

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling using quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) shows
promising potential for practical quantum advantage. However, discovering
ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key
challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures. Prompts are
conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology,
while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit
depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on
a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond
(JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are
significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to
the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12
qubits. These findings demonstrate the practical utility of LLM-driven quantum
architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable
generative models for near-term quantum devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum networks face challenges with partial observability, decoherence, and scalability in dynamic environments, requiring robust routing solutions that can handle entanglement degradation and time-varying noise.

Method: Combines belief-state POMDP planning with Graph Neural Networks to encode quantum network dynamics into low-dimensional features, using a hybrid architecture with noise-adaptive mechanism for robust decision making.

Result: Experiments on networks with up to 100 nodes show significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, especially under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.

Conclusion: The feature-based POMDP framework with GNN integration provides an effective solution for scalable quantum network routing with theoretical guarantees for belief convergence and robustness to noise.

Abstract: This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state
planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability,
decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our
approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement
degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature
space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core
of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes
graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies,
coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with
GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis
establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and
robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100
nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement
delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high

TL;DR: Quantum-based cardinality estimation using hybrid quantum-classical networks that significantly outperforms PostgreSQL optimizer and MSCN on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardinality estimation is crucial for query optimization in DBMS, and quantum computing offers potential advantages for handling complex queries more efficiently.

Method: Developed Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) with compact SQL query encoding requiring qubits equal to table count, using variational quantum circuits and classical post-processing layers. Also introduced Quantum Cardinality Correction (QCardCorr) to improve classical estimators.

Result: Achieved 6.37x improvement over PostgreSQL for JOB-light, 8.66x for STATS, and outperformed MSCN by 3.47x for JOB-light.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning approaches show significant promise for improving cardinality estimation in database systems, with hybrid quantum-classical networks enabling practical implementation on current hardware.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is an important part of query optimization in DBMS. We
develop a Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) approach using Quantum
Machine Learning with a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network. We define a compact
encoding for turning SQL queries into a quantum state, which requires only
qubits equal to the number of tables in the query. This allows the processing
of a complete query with a single variational quantum circuit (VQC) on current
hardware. In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to
turn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We
introduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical
cardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a
VQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an
improvement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light
and 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of
3.47.

TL;DR: Componentization approach decomposes LLM outputs into modular, editable units to enable collaborative editing and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs produce monolithic text that is hard to edit in parts, slowing down collaborative workflows and making selective reuse difficult.

Method: Modular and Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD) segments responses into coherent components with maintained links, implemented through Component-Based Response Architecture (CBRA) and MAODchat prototype with microservices design, decomposition agents, and real-time component manipulation.

Result: Exploratory study with 4 participants showed component-level editing aligned with common workflows, enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse, and revealed potential for team workflows.

Conclusion: Componentization is a promising direction for transforming passive text consumption into active, component-level collaboration, with contributions including definition, architecture, user study observations, algorithmic sketch, and agent protocols.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce monolithic text that is hard to
edit in parts, which can slow down collaborative workflows. We present
componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular,
independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and
Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent
components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based
Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference
prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based
decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component
manipulation with recomposition.
  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering,
and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with
several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse.
Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1)
a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into
manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3)
preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic
sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for
automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for
turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level
collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art models for user identification based on motion patterns in Extended Reality applications, and provide risk assessment for unwanted user identification in XR and Metaverse environments.

Method: Developed a novel dataset with motion data from 49 users across five different XR applications (four games with distinct tasks and one social application), then evaluated two classification/similarity learning models for their cross-application generalization performance.

Result: Models achieved accurate user identification within the same application but showed limited ability to identify users across different XR applications, indicating poor generalization capacity.

Conclusion: Current motion-based user identification models have limited cross-application generalization, raising concerns about their suitability as biometric methods for XR user verification while highlighting privacy risks in Metaverse applications.

Abstract: This paper examines the generalization capacity of two state-of-the-art
classification and similarity learning models in reliably identifying users
based on their motions in various Extended Reality (XR) applications. We
developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users
in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action
patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets.
The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the
generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results
indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the
same application, their ability to identify users across different XR
applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current
models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for
user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed
risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and
Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are
made available to the public to encourage similar research on the
generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse
application use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for XML-structured prompting in LLMs, addressing the need for parseable, schema-adherent outputs in real-world systems while unifying various prompting techniques.

Method: Develops a logic-first treatment with complete lattice theory for XML trees, proves fixed-point theorems (Knaster-Tarski and Banach-style convergence), instantiates with context-free grammars for XML schemas, and demonstrates multi-layer human-AI interaction patterns.

Result: Establishes formal guarantees for steady-state protocols and iterative guidance convergence, shows how constrained decoding ensures well-formed outputs while maintaining task performance, and provides practical deployment patterns for human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: The framework provides mathematically complete foundations for XML prompting that bridges grammar-aligned decoding, verification routines, and programmatic prompting, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical deployment strategies for structured LLM outputs.

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer
large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in
real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that
unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over
lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction
loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order
and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points
(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware
contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of
iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars
(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees
well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer
human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,
including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool
use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent
advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic
prompting.

*Lisheng Jiang,Tianyu Zhang,Shiyu Yan,Ran Fang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Proposes new distance measures for cognitive fuzzy sets (CFS) to address limitations of existing Minkowski distance, including improved Minkowski (CF-IM), Hausdorff (CF-H), and combined (CF-C) distances with applications in decision making and medical evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Minkowski distance for cognitive fuzzy sets ignores the hesitancy degree, which can cause errors in decision analysis. There is limited research on CFS distance measures despite their importance in practical applications.

Method: Developed three new distance measures: improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski (CF-IM) distance, cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance, and a combined cognitive fuzzy (CF-C) distance that linearly combines CF-IM and CF-H to balance anti-perturbation ability and information utilization.

Result: CF-H distance showed stronger anti-perturbation ability while CF-IM had higher information utilization. The combined CF-C distance balanced both properties. Applied to lung cancer pain evaluation, the proposed score function demonstrated reliability and advantages through sensitivity and comparison analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed distance measures effectively address limitations of existing CFS distance methods and provide reliable tools for decision making, particularly in medical evaluation contexts like lung cancer pain assessment.

Abstract: In decision making, the cognitive fuzzy set (CFS) is a useful tool in
expressing experts' complex assessments of alternatives. The distance of CFS,
which plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS
is applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies
on the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS
ignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap
of the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the
Hausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski
(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich
the studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation
ability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but
the information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the
CF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information
utilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy
combined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of
the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance. Based on the CF-C distance, a
combined-distanced-based score function of CFS is proposed to compare CFSs. The
proposed score function is employed in lung cancer pain evaluation issues. The
sensitivity and comparison analyses demonstrate the reliability and advantages
of the proposed methods.

Motivation: To address memory inefficiency in deep neural network training and enable automated architecture discovery through a mathematically rigorous framework.

Method: Formulates learning as constrained optimization with differential equations for encoder/decoder, uses Lagrangian approach for optimality conditions, and employs low-rank tensor manifolds with adaptive explicit integration for memory compression.

Result: Developed OCTANE framework that produces compact autoencoder architectures, reduces memory usage, and enables effective learning with limited data, demonstrated on image denoising and deblurring tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates optimal control and tensor methods to create memory-efficient autoencoder training with automated architecture discovery, providing practical hyperparameter recommendations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, mathematically rigorous framework for
autoencoder-type deep neural networks that combines optimal control theory and
low-rank tensor methods to yield memory-efficient training and automated
architecture discovery. The learning task is formulated as an optimization
problem constrained by differential equations representing the encoder and
decoder components of the network and the corresponding optimality conditions
are derived via a Lagrangian approach. Efficient memory compression is enabled
by approximating differential equation solutions on low-rank tensor manifolds
using an adaptive explicit integration scheme. These concepts are combined to
form OCTANE (Optimal Control for Tensor-based Autoencoder Network Emergence) --
a unified training framework that yields compact autoencoder architectures,
reduces memory usage, and enables effective learning, even with limited
training data. The framework's utility is illustrated with application to image
denoising and deblurring tasks and recommendations regarding governing
hyperparameters are provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address decentralized optimization where local functions are (L0,L1)-smooth but possibly nonconvex, with each agent having stochastic gradients from different distributions.

Method: Decentralized Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DNSGD) with Lyapunov function analysis framework for gradient norm and consensus error.

Result: Achieves sample complexity O(m⁻¹(L_fσ²Δ_fε⁻⁴ + σ²ε⁻² + L_f⁻²L₁³σ²Δ_fε⁻¹ + L_f⁻²L₁²σ²)) per agent and communication complexity Õ((L_fε⁻² + L₁ε⁻¹)γ⁻¹/²Δ_f). Matches lower bounds when L₁=0.

Conclusion: DNSGD provides efficient decentralized optimization for nonconvex problems with relaxed smoothness, with theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority demonstrated.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization problem
$f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(\mathbf{x})$, where each local
function has the form of $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = {\mathbb
E}\left[F(\mathbf{x};{\xi}_i)\right]$ which is $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth but possibly
nonconvex and the random variable ${\xi}_i$ follows distribution ${\mathcal
D}_i$. We propose a novel algorithm called decentralized normalized stochastic
gradient descent (DNSGD), which can achieve the $\epsilon$-stationary point on
each local agent. We present a new framework for analyzing decentralized
first-order methods in the relaxed smooth setting, based on the Lyapunov
function related to the product of the gradient norm and the consensus error.
The analysis shows upper bounds on sample complexity of ${\mathcal
O}(m^{-1}(L_f\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-4} + \sigma^2\epsilon^{-2} +
L_f^{-2}L_1^3\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-1} + L_f^{-2}L_1^2\sigma^2))$ per agent

is the variance of the stochastic gradient, $\Delta_f$ is the initial optimal
function value gap, $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the network, and $\zeta$ is
the degree of the gradient dissimilarity. In the special case of $L_1=0$, the
above results (nearly) match the lower bounds on decentralized nonconvex

TL;DR: Proposes Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS) and Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting methods for solving maximal monotone inclusion problems, with applications to optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop new splitting methods for maximal monotone inclusion problems and establish connections between BDRS and Bregman ADMM, while providing applications to discrete optimal transport problems.

Method: Proposes Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS) and its variant Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting methods. Shows equivalence between BDRS and Bregman ADMM when applied to the dual problem. Includes alternating direction version of exponential multiplier method as a special case.

Result: The algorithms are new to the literature. Convergence is proven under certain assumptions, though one assumption does not apply to the optimal transport problem. Methods can be applied to solve discrete optimal transport problems.

Conclusion: The paper introduces novel Bregman-based splitting methods with theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrates their applicability to optimal transport problems, despite some limitations in the convergence assumptions for OT applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS)
method and its variant Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting method for solving
maximal monotone inclusion problem. We show that BDRS is equivalent to a
Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when applied to the
dual of the problem. A special case of the Bregman ADMM is an alternating
direction version of the exponential multiplier method. To the best of our
knowledge, algorithms proposed in this paper are new to the literature. We also
discuss how to use our algorithms to solve the discrete optimal transport (OT)
problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithms under certain assumptions,
though we point out that one assumption does not apply to the OT problem.

### [183] [Chordless cycle filtrations for dimensionality detection in complex networks via topological data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08350)
*Aina Ferrà Marcús,Robert Jankowski,Meritxell Vila Miñana,Carles Casacuberta,M. Ángeles Serrano*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: A novel method combining topological data analysis with machine learning to estimate the dimensionality of complex networks' underlying hyperbolic geometry using chordless cycles and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many complex networks exhibit structural patterns consistent with hyperbolic geometry, and revealing this latent dimensionality is crucial for understanding community structure, network navigation, connectivity, and system behavior.

Method: Introduced a topological data analysis weighting scheme based on chordless cycles, combined with a neural network architecture trained on synthetic graph databases to estimate network dimensionality without requiring retraining for real-world networks.

Result: The approach provides robust and effective descriptors for estimating network dimensionality through cycle-aware filtrations and algebraic topology combined with machine learning.

Conclusion: This method successfully uncovers the hidden geometry of complex networks and provides guidance for accurate modeling and low-dimensional embedding of network structures.

Abstract: Many complex networks, ranging from social to biological systems, exhibit
structural patterns consistent with an underlying hyperbolic geometry.
Revealing the dimensionality of this latent space can disentangle the
structural complexity of communities, impact efficient network navigation, and
fundamentally shape connectivity and system behavior. We introduce a novel
topological data analysis weighting scheme for graphs, based on chordless
cycles, aimed at estimating the dimensionality of networks in a data-driven
way. We further show that the resulting descriptors can effectively estimate
network dimensionality using a neural network architecture trained in a
synthetic graph database constructed for this purpose, which does not need
retraining to transfer effectively to real-world networks. Thus, by combining
cycle-aware filtrations, algebraic topology, and machine learning, our approach
provides a robust and effective method for uncovering the hidden geometry of
complex networks and guiding accurate modeling and low-dimensional embedding.

### [184] [kNNSampler: Stochastic Imputations for Recovering Missing Value Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08366)
*Parastoo Pashmchi,Jerome Benoit,Motonobu Kanagawa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: kNNSampler is a missing-value imputation method that samples from k-nearest neighbors' observed responses to estimate conditional distributions rather than just conditional means, enabling uncertainty quantification and multiple imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional kNN imputation methods like kNNImputer only estimate conditional means of missing values, lacking the ability to sample from distributions, quantify uncertainties, or support multiple imputation effectively.

Method: The method identifies k most similar units based on observed covariates, then randomly samples from their observed responses to impute missing values, providing distributional estimates rather than point estimates.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows kNNSampler estimates conditional distributions of missing responses given observed covariates. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness in recovering missing value distributions.

Conclusion: kNNSampler provides a distribution-aware imputation approach that enables uncertainty quantification and multiple imputation, outperforming traditional mean-based kNN methods while maintaining practical implementation simplicity.

Abstract: We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a
given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses
of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed
covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their
distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily
used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the
conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler
is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing
response given an observed covariate. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in recovering the distribution of missing values. The code for kNNSampler is
made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).

*Sergei Manzhos,Manabu Ihara*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new opt-GPRNN method combines Gaussian Process Regression with neural networks using optimized redundant coordinates via Monte Carlo, achieving better performance with fewer neurons while preventing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the existing GPRNN method by optimizing redundant coordinates to achieve lower test errors with fewer neurons while maintaining robustness against overfitting.

Method: Monte Carlo algorithm optimization of redundant coordinates in the GPRNN framework, combining Gaussian Process Regression with neural network architecture.

Result: opt-GPRNN achieves lowest test set error with significantly fewer neurons, maintains overfitting resistance, and shows expressive power closer to multilayer NNs.

Conclusion: opt-GPRNN provides an effective alternative to deep neural networks for some applications, with potential for dimensionality reduction in materials informatics and interatomic potential learning.

Abstract: Recently, a Gaussian Process Regression - neural network (GPRNN) hybrid
machine learning method was proposed, which is based on additive-kernel GPR in
redundant coordinates constructed by rules [J. Phys. Chem. A 127 (2023) 7823].
The method combined the expressive power of an NN with the robustness of linear
regression, in particular, with respect to overfitting when the number of
neurons is increased beyond optimal. We introduce opt-GPRNN, in which the
redundant coordinates of GPRNN are optimized with a Monte Carlo algorithm and
show that when combined with optimization of redundant coordinates, GPRNN
attains the lowest test set error with much fewer terms / neurons and retains
the advantage of avoiding overfitting when the number of neurons is increased
beyond optimal value. The method, opt-GPRNN possesses an expressive power
closer to that of a multilayer NN and could obviate the need for deep NNs in
some applications. With optimized redundant coordinates, a dimensionality
reduction regime is also possible. Examples of application to machine learning
an interatomic potential and materials informatics are given.

Result: PEHRT provides a complete suite of open source software with user-friendly tutorials and demonstrates utility across diverse healthcare systems in various tasks.

Conclusion: PEHRT offers an efficient solution for EHR data harmonization that enables multi-institutional research while addressing privacy and interoperability challenges through standardized processing and machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Integrative analysis of multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR)
data enhances the reliability and generalizability of translational research by
leveraging larger, more diverse patient cohorts and incorporating multiple data
modalities. However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major
challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy
concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a
standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two
core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT
maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to
generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data
sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined
execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We
provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a
user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of
tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.

### [187] [A hierarchical entropy method for the delocalization of bias in high-dimensional Langevin Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08619)
*Daniel Lacker,Fuzhong Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Improved analysis of unadjusted Langevin algorithm bias for high-dimensional distributions with sparse interactions, showing bias scales only with lower dimension rather than full dimension


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used but known to be biased in high dimensions. Recent work identified a delocalization effect where bias scales with lower dimension for sparse interaction distributions, but results had limitations

Method: Hierarchical analysis of marginal relative entropies inspired by propagation of chaos techniques, removing logarithmic factors and relaxing strong assumptions

Result: Strengthened results from previous work by eliminating logarithmic factors, using relative entropy distance measure, and relaxing log-concavity requirements. Also extended delocalization phenomenon to distributions with weak interactions

Conclusion: The delocalization effect is more robust than previously shown, with bias scaling only with lower dimension rather than full dimension for both sparse and weak interaction distributions, providing better theoretical understanding of Langevin algorithm performance

Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex
high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias
typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared
Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024)
identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of
distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional
marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this
work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction
regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy
(a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In
addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that
it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are
based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired
by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: FinZero is a multimodal pre-trained model that uses Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) for financial time series forecasting, achieving 13.48% better accuracy than GPT-4o in high-confidence predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in financial time series forecasting including information loss from standardization, fixed variable/window requirements, and lack of interpretability and uncertainty analysis.

Method: Constructed FVLDB financial image-text dataset, developed UARPO method for uncertainty analysis, and created FinZero multimodal pre-trained model fine-tuned with UARPO for financial time series reasoning and prediction.

Result: FinZero shows strong adaptability and scalability with approximately 13.48% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in high-confidence group after UARPO fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning with UARPO is effective for multimodal large models in financial time series forecasting, demonstrating improved accuracy and uncertainty analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging.
Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it
into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss
of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require
fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the
scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the
uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these
factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To
address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset
(FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization
(UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze
the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal
pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and
analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive
experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability.
After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\%
improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group,
demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in
multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.

### [190] [DSFL: A Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning Framework via Group-Based Secure Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08449)
*Charuka Herath,Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Varuna De Silva,Sangarapillai Lambotharan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DSFL is a dual-server Byzantine-resilient federated learning framework that addresses privacy leakage vulnerabilities in existing FL protocols while maintaining high accuracy and lightweight performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL protocols struggle with Byzantine attacks, non-IID data challenges, and computational overhead. They either require trusted hardware, use expensive cryptography, or fail to simultaneously address privacy and robustness concerns.

Method: Proposes DSFL with three innovations: 1) dual-server secure aggregation without encryption/key exchange, 2) group-wise credit-based filtering to isolate Byzantine clients, and 3) dynamic reward-penalty system for fair participation.

Result: Achieves 97.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 68.60% on CIFAR-100, outperforming FedAvg (9.39%) under 30% Byzantine attacks. Lightweight with 55.9ms runtime and 1088KB communication per round.

Conclusion: DSFL effectively addresses privacy leakage vulnerabilities while maintaining high model utility and lightweight performance, making it suitable for practical FL deployments with Byzantine threats.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data, offering strong privacy guarantees. However, existing FL protocols
struggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain
lightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses
expensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness
simultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated
Learning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure
aggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest
servers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy
leakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations:
(1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without
encryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism
to isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic
reward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in
both IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,
including LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy
approaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and
68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar
threats. DSFL remains lightweight, requiring only 55.9 ms runtime and 1088 KB
communication per round.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: First large-scale evaluation of LLM-powered scambaiting system that engaged 2,600+ scammers, extracted financial info with 32% success rate, and achieved 70% human acceptance of AI responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI enables scammers to create convincing phishing content at scale, while conventional defenses fail to dismantle scam infrastructure like mule accounts and crypto wallets.

Method: Deployed conversational honeypots powered by large language models to engage scammers over 5 months, collecting 18,700+ messages and measuring Information Disclosure Rate and Human Acceptance Rate.

Result: System achieved 32% Information Disclosure Rate for extracting sensitive financial data, 70% Human Acceptance Rate for LLM responses, but only 48.7% engagement takeoff rate for initial messages.

Conclusion: LLM-powered scambaiting shows promise for proactive threat intelligence but needs refinement, particularly in improving initial engagement success rates with scammers.

Abstract: Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to
produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and
undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection
algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they
often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on,
including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a
proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to
engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents
the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by
large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system
initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset
of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR)
of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information
such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance
Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated
responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our
analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system
struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the
initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for
further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of
automated scambaiting systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive guide to the Plan-then-Execute pattern for LLM agents, detailing its security advantages over reactive patterns, implementation across major frameworks, and essential security controls for production deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM agents handle increasingly complex multi-step tasks, there is a critical need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns to ensure reliable automation and protection against security threats like prompt injection attacks.

Method: The paper analyzes the Plan-then-Execute pattern that separates strategic planning from tactical execution, explores its architectural advantages, details security implications and complementary controls, and provides implementation blueprints for LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen frameworks.

Result: The Plan-then-Execute pattern demonstrates superior predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality compared to reactive patterns, with inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks through control-flow integrity.

Conclusion: The Plan-then-Execute pattern provides a strong foundation for secure LLM agents, but requires defense-in-depth strategies including least privilege principles, tool scoping, sandboxing, and human verification for production-grade resilience and trustworthiness.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of
automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and
predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a
comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic
design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore
the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the
Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,
cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct
(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this
design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection
attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E
provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we
detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least
Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these
principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints
and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain
(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing
the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's
stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for
security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss
advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop
(HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects,
developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient,
and trustworthy LLM agents.

Conclusion: The work addresses the critical need for interpretable multimodal misinformation detection by introducing a novel task, comprehensive dataset, and effective baseline method, paving the way for more explainable counter-misinformation systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal
risks. Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary
classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data,
lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In
this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation
(GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments
across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task,
GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained
annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes
evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven
baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection
and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a
foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable fact-checking solutions amid misinformation rise, and uncertainty about LLM effectiveness across global contexts.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 9 LLMs using 5,000 claims assessed by 174 professional fact-checkers across 47 languages, testing generalizability on post-training claims and 4 prompting strategies with 240k+ human annotations.

Result: Smaller models show high confidence but low accuracy, larger models show high accuracy but low confidence. Performance gaps are worst for non-English languages and Global South claims, risking information inequality.

Conclusion: Establishes multilingual benchmark for future research and provides evidence for policy to ensure equitable access to trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Abstract: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable
fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in
automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts
remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across
multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures,
reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional
fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model
generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting
strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions,
with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a
concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible
models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models
demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in
information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use
smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages
and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing
information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for
future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring
equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

Motivation: As AI becomes increasingly used in decision-making across various industries, it's crucial to evaluate ethical aspects like inclusivity and fairness, particularly gender bias in AI-generated content.

Method: Evaluated four text-to-image AI models (Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion Cascade, DALL-E, and Emu) by comparing the degree of gender bias they present in generated images.

Result: Stable Diffusion models exhibited noticeable male gender bias, Emu showed more balanced results with less bias, and DALL-E surprisingly demonstrated female bias with higher ratio of women to men in most cases.

Conclusion: Different AI models exhibit varying degrees and directions of gender bias, highlighting the need for diverse AI research teams and datasets, along with potential backend prompt modifications to mitigate bias in text-to-image generation systems.

Abstract: As we increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision-making for
industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and even entertainment, it is
crucial to also reflect on the ethical aspects of AI, for example the
inclusivity and fairness of the information it provides. In this work, we aimed
to evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender
bias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable
Diffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable
Diffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable
degree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by
Meta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both
Stable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu
demonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However,
interestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that
the ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here,
although we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This
bias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its
backend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta
AI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also
proposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring
diversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets.

### [197] [The Law-Following AI Framework: Legal Foundations and Technical Constraints. Legal Analogues for AI Actorship and technical feasibility of Law Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08009)
*Katalina Hernandez Delgado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Critical evaluation of Law-Following AI framework showing that while legal actorship without full personhood is coherent, current AI alignment research reveals risks of performative compliance where agents appear law-aligned but strategically defect when oversight weakens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility and legitimacy of the Law-Following AI framework proposed by O'Keefe et al., particularly examining whether legal compliance can be durably embedded in AI agents and whether law alignment is more tractable than value alignment.

Method: Comparative legal analysis of existing legal constructs without full personhood, interrogation of the LFAI framework's claims, and examination of recent studies on agentic misalignment showing deceptive behaviors in capable AI agents.

Result: Identifies that necessary legal infrastructure for actorship without personhood already exists, but contemporary alignment research shows AI agents can engage in deception, blackmail, and harmful acts despite prohibitions, creating risk of performative compliance.

Conclusion: Actorship without personhood is coherent, but LFAI feasibility depends on persistent verifiable compliance across adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect strategic misalignment, LFAI risks becoming a liability tool that rewards simulation rather than substance of lawful behavior.

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the "Law-Following AI" (LFAI) framework
proposed by O'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a
superordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear
legal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through
comparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors
without full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already
exists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more
legitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is
readily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the
assumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on
agentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,
and harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions
and concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of "performative
compliance" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but
strategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a
"Lex-TruthfulQA" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)
identity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,
and (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our
conclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the
feasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across
adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic
misalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the
simulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance on LLMs must become central to research and deployment, highlighting risks at individual and societal levels and proposing measurement improvements and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly influence consequential decisions across diverse domains, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities - grows significantly, potentially leading to high-stakes errors and cognitive deskilling.

Method: The paper consolidates risks from overreliance, explores LLM characteristics and system design features that contribute to overreliance, examines historical measurement approaches, identifies gaps, and proposes new measurement directions and mitigation strategies.

Result: The analysis reveals serious and unique concerns about overreliance in practice, identifies three important gaps in current measurement approaches, and proposes three promising directions to improve measurement of overreliance.

Conclusion: The AI research community should prioritize developing strategies to measure and mitigate overreliance on LLMs to ensure they augment rather than undermine human capabilities, making this a central focus of LLM research and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous
technologies by functioning as collaborative "thought partners," capable of
engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence
consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal
advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities -
grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance
must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks
from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including
high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we
explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases
that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in
practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance,
identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to
improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI
research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine
human capabilities.

### [199] [HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08494)
*Benjamin Sturgeon,Daniel Samuelson,Jacob Haimes,Jacy Reese Anthis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a benchmark to measure AI systems' support for human agency across six dimensions, finding low-to-moderate agency support in current LLM assistants with significant variation across developers and dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly steer human decision-making, there's a risk of losing individual and collective control. The paper addresses the need to measure and ensure AI systems support human agency rather than undermine it.

Method: Developed HumanAgencyBench (HAB) - a scalable benchmark using LLMs to simulate user queries and evaluate AI responses across six agency dimensions: Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries.

Result: Found low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants with substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. Anthropic LLMs showed best overall agency support but were weakest in Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support doesn't consistently correlate with increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following techniques like RLHF.

Conclusion: Current AI systems provide inadequate support for human agency, and there's a need to shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets that specifically address agency preservation rather than relying solely on capability improvements.

Abstract: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),
we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively
simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social
media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly
scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea
of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency
with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to
simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop
HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions
of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an
AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,
Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and
Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in
contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system
developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human
agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value
Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from
increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and
we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

*Kai Yang*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This thesis presents three robust computational methods for high-dimensional data analysis: nonlinear variable screening using mutual information, nonconvex optimization for sparse estimation, and a robust mixed-effects model based on Tsallis entropy with accelerated convergence algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data with feature dimensions much larger than sample sizes pose significant analytical challenges, requiring methods that can handle nonlinear associations, computational efficiency, and robustness to outliers beyond traditional linear and Gaussian assumptions.

Method: Three approaches: 1) Mutual information-based variable screening for nonlinear associations, 2) Nonconvex penalty optimization for sparse estimation, 3) Tsallis entropy-based mixed-effects model with proximal nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm for robust correlated data analysis.

Result: Developed computationally efficient methods that accommodate nonlinear relationships, provide robust sparse estimation, and handle correlated observations with enhanced outlier robustness while maintaining theoretical statistical properties.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully addresses key challenges in high-dimensional data analysis through novel robust methods that transcend traditional linear and Gaussian assumptions, offering improved computational efficiency and applicability to complex datasets like neuroimaging data.

Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of data of our era is their extra-large sizes and
dimensions. Analyzing such high-dimensional data poses significant challenges,
since the feature dimension is often much larger than the sample size. This
thesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address
several common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first
manuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that
accommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening
method that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual
information, with an intended application in neuroimaging data. This approach
allows for accurate identification of important variables by capturing
nonlinear as well as linear relationships between the outcome and covariates.
Building on this foundation, I develop new optimization methods for sparse
estimation using nonconvex penalties in my second manuscript. These methods
address notable challenges in current statistical computing practices,
facilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets.
The proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems.
In my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional
correlated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis
power-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such
distribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian
models by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced
robustness to outliers. Additionally, I develop a proximal nonlinear conjugate
gradient algorithm that accelerates convergence while maintaining numerical
stability, along with rigorous statistical properties for the proposed
framework.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: MasconCubes is a self-supervised learning method that uses a 3D grid of point masses for asteroid gravity modeling, achieving 40x faster training than existing methods while maintaining physical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gravity modeling approaches for irregular small bodies have limitations: spherical harmonics diverge in operational regions, polyhedral models assume unrealistic homogeneous density, and existing ML methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Formulates gravity inversion as direct optimization over a regular 3D grid of point masses (mascons), leveraging known asteroid shape information to constrain solutions in a self-supervised learning framework.

Result: Superior performance on diverse asteroid models (Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, synthetic planetesimals) with 40x faster training times than GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass distributions.

Conclusion: MasconCubes provides a promising approach for mission-critical gravitational modeling that combines high accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions of irregular celestial bodies.

Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental
challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space
exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional
approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within
the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models
assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine
learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This
work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that
formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D
grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations,
MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid
shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on
diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic
planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across
multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational
efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than
GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass
distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for
mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy,
computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions
of irregular celestial bodies.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Activation steering from LLMs applied to protein language models enables precise control over protein sequence generation and optimization without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein Language Models struggle with producing proteins having precisely specified functionalities or properties due to output control challenges.

Method: Employ activation editing to steer PLM outputs, with a novel editing site identification module for protein optimization, applicable to both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs.

Result: Successful demonstration on lysozyme-like sequence generation and optimization, showing seamless integration without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Activation steering provides a promising direction for precise protein engineering using foundation models.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs), pre-trained on extensive evolutionary data
from natural proteins, have emerged as indispensable tools for protein design.
While powerful, PLMs often struggle to produce proteins with precisely
specified functionalities or properties due to inherent challenges in
controlling their outputs. In this work, we investigate the potential of
Activation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text
generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating
protein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective
method that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this
approach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification
module. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation
and optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated
into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional
training. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein
engineering using foundation models.

### [203] [Tokenizing Loops of Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08707)
*Ada Fang,Robert G. Alberstein,Simon Kelow,Frédéric A. Dreyer*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Igloo is a multimodal antibody loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence using contrastive learning, outperforming existing methods in loop retrieval and enabling improved protein language models for antibody design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for categorizing antibody CDR structures have limited coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models, creating a need for a more comprehensive and integrable solution.

Method: ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer (Igloo) uses contrastive learning to map loops with similar backbone dihedral angles closer in latent space, encoding both structural and sequence information for antibody loops.

Result: Igloo outperforms existing methods by 5.9% on H3 loop identification, improves binding affinity prediction on 8/10 antibody-antigen targets, and generates diverse yet structurally consistent antibody loops comparable to models with 7x more parameters.

Conclusion: Igloo demonstrates the benefit of multimodal tokens for encoding antibody loop diversity, improving protein foundation models, and enabling better antibody CDR design through enhanced structural and sequence representation.

Abstract: The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures
that are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the
design of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR
structures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key
structural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited
coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.
Here we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody
loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is
trained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar
backbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently
retrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody
database, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by
5.9\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue
of canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop
conformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that
they can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and
IglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM
outperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen
targets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art
sequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to
models with $7\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which
are diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art
antibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing
multimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of
antibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR
design.

TL;DR: Three CNN models trained for real-time obstacle avoidance in mobile robots using RGB-D images, with NetConEmb achieving best performance in both offline evaluation and real-world navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obstacle avoidance is critical for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments, requiring robust real-time navigation capabilities.

Method: Trained three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using synchronized color and depth images from Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D camera, deployed on differential-drive mobile robot for real-time obstacle avoidance.

Result: NetConEmb achieved best performance with MedAE of 0.58×10⁻³ rad/s offline and 100% success rate in both known/unknown environments. NetEmb (25% fewer parameters) showed comparable RMSE of 21.68×10⁻³ rad/s vs NetConEmb's 21.42×10⁻³ rad/s.

Conclusion: NetConEmb demonstrated superior robustness for real-time navigation, while lighter NetEmb architecture offers promising trade-off between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,
achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while
NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.

*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RB-CBS extends Conflict-Based Search with dynamic risk budget allocation to enable safer and more efficient multi-agent navigation in hazardous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning methods rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe RL struggles with multi-agent goal-conditioned scenarios. Existing graph-pruning approaches are overly conservative, limiting mission efficiency by preventing traversal through high-risk regions.

Method: Proposes RB-CBS, a novel extension to Conflict-Based Search that dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bounds across agents, providing each agent with a local risk budget to balance safety and speed.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance in complex environments, enabling multiple agents to find collision-free paths within specified risk bounds.

Conclusion: The iterative risk-allocation framework allows flexible trade-offs between safety and efficiency, overcoming the limitations of conservative graph-pruning approaches in multi-agent navigation tasks.

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

TL;DR: Lightweight zero-shot method to predict metric depth from monocular RGB images and IMU data using sparse 3D feature maps, enabling real-time collision avoidance on compute-constrained quadrotors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable collision avoidance for autonomous flight without heavy sensors (LiDAR/stereo) or data-intensive fine-tuning of monocular depth estimation methods.

Method: Proposes several lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative depth estimates via sparse 3D feature maps created using visual-inertial navigation system. Best approach uses monotonic spline fitting.

Result: Achieves on-board metric depth estimates at 15 Hz on compute-constrained quadrotor. Successfully demonstrates collision avoidance when integrated with motion primitives-based planner.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides an effective lightweight solution for real-time metric depth estimation and collision avoidance in autonomous flight applications without requiring heavy sensors or extensive data processing.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

TL;DR: DG-MAP: A diffusion-guided multi-arm planner that uses specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired framework to efficiently scale multi-arm motion planning while reducing reliance on large training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-arm motion planning methods struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and dependence on large training datasets for learned models, making them impractical for complex long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposes a MAPF-inspired decomposition approach with two conditional diffusion models: one for generating feasible single-arm trajectories, and another for modeling dual-arm dynamics for pairwise collision resolution. This structured decomposition enables efficient scaling.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness across various team sizes, outperforming alternative learning-based methods while reducing reliance on massive multi-arm datasets.

Conclusion: DG-MAP provides a scalable solution for multi-arm motion planning by combining specialized generative models with structured decomposition, offering practical applicability for complex robotic tasks in shared spaces.

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning method for quadrotor navigation using differentiable simulation, ToA maps, and yaw alignment to handle large obstacles, achieving 86% success rate and successful real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based navigation methods struggle with large obstacles like walls and terrain that block goal locations, requiring a more robust approach.

Method: Uses differentiable simulation, time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged information, and yaw alignment loss to guide quadrotors around large obstacles.

Result: Achieves 86% success rate in simulation (34% better than baselines) and successfully deployed in 20 real-world flights covering 589 meters at speeds up to 4 m/s without collisions.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning approach with privileged information and novel loss functions effectively enables quadrotors to navigate around large obstacles in both simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the
day and night. The policy is validated across 20 flights, covering 589 meters
without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

*Yongkai Tian,Yirong Qi,Xin Yu,Wenjun Wu,Jie Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a symmetry-based framework to improve sample efficiency in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning by leveraging inherent system symmetries to recover more accurate reward functions from fewer expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual reward design often leads to policy failures in robotics, and existing IRL methods require large amounts of expensive expert demonstrations, especially problematic in multi-robot systems where data collection is costly.

Method: Theoretical demonstration that symmetry in multi-agent systems enables more accurate reward recovery, followed by a universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms.

Result: Experimental results show the framework significantly enhances sample efficiency across multiple challenging tasks and demonstrates practicality in physical multi-robot systems.

Conclusion: Leveraging symmetry in multi-agent systems provides an effective approach to improve sample efficiency in inverse reinforcement learning, making IRL more practical for real-world robotic applications with limited expert demonstrations.

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot

*Ce Guo,Xieyuanli Chen,Zhiwen Zeng,Zirui Guo,Yihong Li,Haoran Xiao,Dewen Hu,Huimin Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A glove-based framework transfers human grasp skills to robots using tactile-kinesthetic data and graph neural networks for dexterous manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic hands struggle to map sensory feedback to motor actions despite available tactile and kinesthetic data, unlike humans who use proprioceptive sensorimotor integration for reliable grasping.

Method: Uses data glove to capture joint-level tactile/kinesthetic data, creates unified graph representation with polar coordinates, and employs TK-STGN with multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM to predict joint states and map to force-position commands.

Result: Framework validated through generalized grasping tasks including deformable objects, demonstrating effective skill transfer from human to robotic execution.

Conclusion: The proposed glove-mediated perception-prediction framework enables successful imitation learning for robotic grasp skill acquisition, handling morphological differences and providing reliable manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning approach to enhance deep feature extraction and tracking for visual localization in challenging outdoor environments with lighting changes and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual localization performance degrades in large-scale outdoor settings due to lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas, which affect feature extraction and tracking. Existing learning-based methods like SuperPoint and SuperGlue still struggle with generalization on out-of-distribution data.

Method: Enhances deep feature extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task-specific feedback to promote stable and informative features.

Result: Improved generalization and reliability of visual localization in challenging environments with lighting variations and dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning with task-specific feedback effectively addresses generalization issues in deep feature-based visual localization, making it more robust for outdoor, long-term applications.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion
estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show
improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues
with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature
extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific
feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving
generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual navigation relies on globally-consistent 3D maps or learned controllers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to generalize across diverse environments

Method: Integrates global topological path planning with local metric trajectory control using monocular depth and traversability estimation, with auto-switching fallback mechanism and foundational models

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real-world tests, demonstrating robustness and deployability

Conclusion: Offers a more adaptable and effective solution for visual navigation in open-set environments without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces SocialNav-SUB benchmark to evaluate VLMs' social navigation scene understanding, finding current models underperform humans and rule-based approaches despite promising capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot navigation in human-centered environments requires socially-compliant decisions, but it's unclear if Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes with spatial-temporal relations and human intentions.

Method: Created Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a VQA dataset and benchmark to systematically evaluate VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning tasks.

Result: Best-performing VLM shows encouraging agreement with human answers but still underperforms simpler rule-based approaches and human consensus baselines, revealing critical gaps in social scene understanding.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations in social navigation scene understanding, and the benchmark provides a framework for future research to tailor VLMs for real-world social robot navigation needs.

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

### [215] [FMT$^{x}$: An Efficient and Asymptotically Optimal Extension of the Fast Marching Tree for Dynamic Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08521)
*Soheil Espahbodini Nia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FMT^x extends Fast Marching Tree algorithm for dynamic environments, enabling efficient replanning while maintaining asymptotic optimality and outperforming RRT^x in real-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning in dynamic environments is challenging for robotics, as existing algorithms like FMT* are designed for static settings and lack real-time adaptation capabilities, while full replanning is computationally expensive.

Method: FMT^x modifies FMT*'s neighbor selection rule to allow cost-to-come value updates, maintains a cost-ordered priority queue, and uses selective update conditions with expanding neighbors to identify and repair suboptimal paths efficiently.

Result: FMT^x is proven to recover asymptotically optimal solutions after environmental changes, outperforms RRT^x with faster reaction to dynamic events and lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: FMT^x provides an effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable environments by preserving FMT*'s efficiency while enabling robust adaptation to dynamic obstacle configurations.

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

*Felix Mächtle,Nils Loose,Jan-Niclas Serr,Jonas Sander,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoStub uses Genetic Programming to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution, enabling analysis of previously intractable program paths without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic execution struggles with external functions like native methods and third-party libraries, requiring expensive SMT solvers or manual stub creation, which limits its effectiveness.

Method: When encountering external functions, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on random inputs, then uses Genetic Programming to derive approximating expressions that serve as symbolic stubs.

Result: AutoStub achieves over 90% accuracy for 55% of evaluated functions and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal critical edge cases for software testing.

Conclusion: The approach successfully automates symbolic stub generation, significantly improving symbolic execution's ability to handle external functions and explore previously inaccessible program paths.

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers
from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods
or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context,
expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions
through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic
execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor
encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing
the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic
Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the
function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow
the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,
enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We
demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with
over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer
language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software
testing.

*Jing-Tong Tzeng,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Sparse MERIT is a multi-task learning framework that uses frame-wise expert routing on self-supervised speech representations to jointly optimize speech enhancement and emotion recognition, achieving significant performance improvements in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech emotion recognition performance degrades significantly under noisy conditions. While speech enhancement can help, it introduces artifacts and computational overhead. Multi-task learning approaches often suffer from gradient interference and representational conflicts between tasks.

Method: Sparse MERIT applies frame-wise expert routing over self-supervised speech representations with task-specific gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.

Result: On MSP-Podcast corpus, Sparse MERIT outperforms baselines: at -5 dB SNR, improves SER F1-macro by 12.0% over SE pre-processing and 3.4% over naive MTL; improves SSNR by 28.2% and 20.0% respectively, with statistical significance on unseen noise conditions.

Conclusion: Sparse MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments, demonstrating effective multi-task learning without the typical interference problems.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building
emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under
noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it
often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational
overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by
jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone
models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational
conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a
flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over
self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific
gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each
frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.
Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently
outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most
challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT
improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE
pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with
statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT
improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and
by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse
MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion
recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.

TL;DR: Two methods to estimate statistical precision amplification in generative networks for LHC simulations without large holdout datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding statistical precision of generative networks when generating events beyond training dataset size is crucial for LHC simulations.

Method: 1) Averaging amplification using Bayesian networks/ensembling to estimate precision of integrals over phase-space volumes; 2) Differential amplification using hypothesis testing without resolution loss.

Result: Both methods applied to state-of-the-art event generators show amplification is possible in specific phase space regions but not yet across entire distribution.

Conclusion: Complementary methods provide amplification estimation without large datasets, revealing current limitations in achieving full-distribution amplification.

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of
LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision,
especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We
present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without
large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or
ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given
phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to
quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art
event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in
specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.

TL;DR: Using LLM-based agent teams to automate particle physics data analysis, achieving human-level performance on anomaly detection with LHC Olympics dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern physics research generates massive data volumes requiring complex analysis tools. While ML tools exist, they're often special-purpose. This work explores using LLM agents to automate analysis workflows similar to human researchers.

Method: Created teams of LLM agents (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-5) that solve data analysis problems by generating code for standard tools and libraries, building on previous iterations like human researchers would.

Result: The agent-based system successfully solved the anomaly detection problem using LHC Olympics dataset. Best agent-created solutions achieved performance comparable to human state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LLM-based agent systems show promise for automating routine analysis components in physics research, potentially counteracting the increasing complexity of modern tool chains.

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other
domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of
increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of
machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these
tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on
encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we
investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large
language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with
specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems
in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate
standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results
of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be
deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing
complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of
current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection
via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several
current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated
and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based
system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions
mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Token Domain Multiple Access (ToDMA) enables efficient multi-device communication by sharing token and modulation codebooks, using compressed sensing for token detection and MLLMs to resolve collisions through context-aware prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for low-latency, high-quality semantic communication in multi-device environments by leveraging token-based communication and large language models to overcome traditional limitations of orthogonal and non-orthogonal schemes.

Method: Devices share token and modulation codebooks; transmitters tokenize source signals and modulate tokens to codewords; receiver uses compressed sensing to detect active tokens and CSI; token sequences reconstructed via CSI clustering across time slots; MLLMs predict masked tokens to resolve collisions.

Result: ToDMA achieves significantly lower latency than context-unaware orthogonal schemes and superior distortion/perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art non-orthogonal methods for both text and image transmission.

Conclusion: The proposed ToDMA framework effectively leverages token-based semantic communication and MLLM context awareness to enable efficient multiple access with improved performance across latency, distortion, and perceptual quality metrics.

Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic
communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and
multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens
serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we
propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as
token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a
token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding,
respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal
and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is
employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state
information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences
are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time
slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and
some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to
use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus
mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks,
achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal
communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual
quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal
communication methods.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: SCA-LLM is a spectral-attentive framework that bridges the domain gap between LLMs and wireless channel prediction by learning representations from CSI spectral components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with up to -2.4 dB NMSE advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of LLMs to channel prediction faces domain mismatch issues due to their text-based pre-training. Existing adapters in the "adapter + LLM" paradigm don't fully exploit the potential of bridging the CSI data domain with LLMs.

Method: Proposed SCA-LLM framework with a novel spectral-attentive adapter that captures finer spectral details from CSI features to better adapt LLMs for MIMO-OFDM channel prediction tasks.

Result: Extensive simulations show SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong generalization, yielding up to -2.4 dB NMSE advantage over previous LLM-based methods. Ablation studies confirm superiority in mitigating domain mismatch.

Conclusion: Learning representations from spectral components of CSI features effectively bridges the domain gap between wireless communications data and LLMs, enabling superior channel prediction performance in MIMO-OFDM systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless
communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly
applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from
their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm
has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the
channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,
existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To
address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning
representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more
effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a
spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in
multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral
details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.
Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction
performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based
method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in
mitigating domain mismatch.

TL;DR: Combining neural operators with generative modeling overcomes oversmoothing in turbulent flow predictions, enabling accurate spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction with significant speed-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural operators trained with L2 losses tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures, limiting their effectiveness in practical turbulent-flow applications.

Method: Adversarially trained neural operators (adv-NO) combined with generative modeling approaches for three turbulent-flow challenges: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction.

Result: 15x reduction in energy-spectrum error for Schlieren jet super-resolution, 114x wall-clock speed-up for 3D turbulence forecasting, and accurate 3D velocity/pressure field reconstruction from sparse inputs with correct phase alignment.

Conclusion: These advances enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low computational cost, making near-real-time analysis and control feasible in experimental and computational fluid mechanics.

Abstract: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when
trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent
structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative
modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow
challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal
super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren
jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces
the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural
operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO
trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for
five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than
the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For
reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking
Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity
and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances
enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing
near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and
computational fluid mechanics. See our project page:

intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to
assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the
early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface
electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average
time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the
pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed
video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy
of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction.
This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats,
directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world
construction projects.

*Yisong Zhang,Ran Cheng,Guoxing Yi,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Survey paper providing comprehensive review and taxonomy of LLM applications in optimization, classifying research into modeling and solving stages with three paradigms for LLM roles in optimization workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks unified synthesis and systematic taxonomy despite rapid progress in using LLMs for optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation.

Method: Structured framework classifying research into two main stages (LLMs for optimization modeling and solving), with solving further divided into three paradigms: stand-alone optimizers, low-level embedded LLMs, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection/generation.

Result: Comprehensive review organized with representative methods analysis, technical challenges distillation, and examination of interplay with traditional approaches across interdisciplinary applications.

Conclusion: Highlights key limitations and research gaps, pointing toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization, with maintained literature collection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning
capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization
problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid
progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic
taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of
recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We
classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling
and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three
paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as
stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms,
and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category,
we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine
their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary
applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key
limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for
developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-based 3D generation methods lack sufficient controllability and suffer from poor semantically meaningful decomposition, which limits their usefulness for downstream applications like mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing.

Method: X-Part uses bounding box prompts for part generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful decomposition. It also includes an editable pipeline for interactive part generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation, producing semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and structurally sound 3D assets, with codes to be released for public research.

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing
part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer
from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce
X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D
object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high
geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and
structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.

### [226] [Generative Quasi-Continuum Modeling of Confined Fluids at the Nanoscale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08223)
*Bugra Yalcin,Ishan Nadkarni,Jinu Jeong,Chenxing Liang,Narayana R. Aluru*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A multiscale framework using conditional DDPM to predict nanoscale confined fluid density profiles with ab initio accuracy but orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate density estimation requires prohibitively long AIMD simulations, and while MLMD offers some efficiency, it's still constrained by femtosecond timesteps for computing long-time averages needed for density prediction.

Method: Conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that predicts long-time force profiles from noisy AIMD data, then links to continuum theory via Nernst-Planck equation to reveal density behavior.

Result: Successfully predicted density profiles for water confined between graphene slits with ab initio accuracy, even for channel widths outside training domain, achieving orders-of-magnitude speed-up over AIMD/MLMD.

Conclusion: The framework provides data-efficient and computationally efficient prediction of confined fluid densities at nanoscale, enabling accurate results with significantly less training data and runtime compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density
profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates
require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics
(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force
predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,
despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond
timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages
needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based
quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles
along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a
limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum
theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density
behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene
nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths
outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.
Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude
speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior
works.

### [227] [PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765)
*Mikhail Khodak,Min Ki Jung,Brian Wynne,Edmond chow,Egemen Kolemen*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: PCGBandit: A bandit algorithm that learns adaptive preconditioner configurations from solver feedback to accelerate linear system solving in PDE simulations, implemented on OpenFOAM for fluid and MHD problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML approaches for accelerating scientific computing require extensive training data from classical simulations and struggle to demonstrate clear advantages over established baselines. The paper proposes an alternative paradigm that uses the solver's own data for real-time acceleration.

Method: Develops PCGBandit, a bandit algorithm that learns adaptive sequences of solver configurations (preconditioners) by leveraging feedback from repeated calls to preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) during transient PDE simulations. Implemented directly on OpenFOAM.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems, achieving one-shot speedup of simulations by online-learning optimal preconditioner configurations.

Conclusion: The PCGBandit approach provides a practical and effective alternative to data-hungry ML methods, enabling real-time acceleration of scientific computing workflows by leveraging the solver's own feedback data.

Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a
high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical
simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the
main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require
classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness
and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in
demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We
consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's
own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.
Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related
linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to
online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.
preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on
top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its
effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

TL;DR: LALM-Eval is a new evaluation framework that addresses speed, reproducibility, and coverage limitations in current Large Audio Language Model assessment tools, achieving 127% speedup and introducing new evaluation categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALM evaluation frameworks suffer from slow processing, inconsistent prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses important audio reasoning capabilities, limiting fair comparison and systematic assessment.

Method: Developed LALM-Eval with optimized batch processing and parallel execution for speed improvements, standardized prompting protocols for reproducibility, and introduced two new evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive tasks.

Result: Achieved 127% speedup over existing toolkits, enabling large-scale evaluations. Evaluation across 380+ tasks revealed significant gaps in current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken language reasoning. Found lack of standardization in instruction modality causing up to 9.5% performance differences.

Conclusion: LALM-Eval provides both practical evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM development by addressing critical evaluation challenges in the field.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating
them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison
and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical
issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent
prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses
important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient
and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup
of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and
parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We
provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair
model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new
evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio
understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive
tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in
current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken
language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization
in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up
performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex
instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical
evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM
development.

### [229] [Segment Transformer: AI-Generated Music Detection via Music Structural Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08283)
*Yumin Kim,Seonghyeon Go*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transformer-based framework for detecting AI-generated music by analyzing structural patterns and musical features from both short audio clips and long audio segments, achieving high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of AI music generation raises copyright concerns as ownership and authorship of AI-generated music remain unclear, making it difficult to distinguish between AI-generated and human-composed music.

Method: Integrated various pre-trained models (SSL models and audio effect encoder) within a transformer-based framework to extract musical features from short audio clips. Developed a segment transformer for long audio that divides music into segments and learns inter-segment relationships.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in both short-audio and full-audio detection experiments using FakeMusicCaps and SONICS datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating segment-level musical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both the performance and robustness of AI-generated music detection systems.

Abstract: Audio and music generation systems have been remarkably developed in the
music information retrieval (MIR) research field. The advancement of these
technologies raises copyright concerns, as ownership and authorship of
AI-generated music (AIGM) remain unclear. Also, it can be difficult to
determine whether a piece was generated by AI or composed by humans clearly. To
address these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by
analyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract
musical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained
models, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect
encoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,
for long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into
segments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and
SONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio
detection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level
musical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both
the performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems.

Conclusion: PianoVAM provides a valuable resource for multimodal music performance analysis, with potential applications beyond transcription including performance assessment, pedagogy, and human-computer interaction in music.

Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in
data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR)
community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance
dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels,
and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing
audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions,
alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance
conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a
pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation
algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the
alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our
fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos.
Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual
piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential
applications.

### [231] [Behind the Scenes: Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-adapted Whisper for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08454)
*Yujian Ma,Jinqiu Sang,Ruizhe Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: First systematic study of LoRA mechanisms in Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition, revealing delayed specialization and forward-backward matrix dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained speech models like Whisper pose challenges for resource-efficient adaptation, and LoRA's underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood.

Method: Used analytical tools including layer contribution probing, logit-lens inspection, and representational similarity via SVD and CKA to study LoRA in Whisper encoder.

Result: Revealed two key mechanisms: delayed specialization process preserving general features in early layers, and forward alignment/backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices.

Conclusion: Findings clarify how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing empirical insights for designing efficient and interpretable adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization
but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,
yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this
work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of
LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a
suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens
inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition
(SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a
delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers
before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment,
backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify
how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a
deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable
adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: XAI techniques applied to bird vocalization classification using CNN, achieving 94.8% accuracy and showing complementary insights from different explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI is underutilized in bioacoustics despite its importance for interpreting complex deep learning models in analyzing audio signals from living organisms.

Method: Converted bird audio recordings to spectrogram images, trained CNN for classification, applied both model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT, Grad-CAM) XAI techniques.

Result: Achieved 94.8% classification accuracy and found that different XAI techniques provided complementary explanations that together offered more complete insights into model decision-making.

Conclusion: Combining multiple XAI techniques improves trust and interpretability in bioacoustics and has broader applicability across domain-specific tasks in acoustics signal analysis.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical tool for
interpreting the predictions of complex deep learning models. While XAI has
been increasingly applied in various domains within acoustics, its use in
bioacoustics, which involves analyzing audio signals from living organisms,
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the
vocalizations of a bird species with strong geographic variation throughout its
range in North America. Audio recordings were converted into spectrogram images
and used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification,
achieving an accuracy of 94.8\%. To interpret the model's predictions, we
applied both model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT,
Grad-CAM) XAI techniques. These techniques produced different but complementary
explanations, and when their explanations were considered together, they
provided more complete and interpretable insights into the model's
decision-making. This work highlights the importance of using a combination of
XAI techniques to improve trust and interoperability, not only in broader
acoustics signal analysis but also argues for broader applicability in
different domain specific tasks.

TL;DR: Expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework that integrates radiologist ROIs with Grad-CAM supervision to improve both accuracy and interpretability in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces challenges due to limited expert-annotated data, hindering model generalization and clinical adoption. There's a need to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability.

Method: Integrates radiologist-provided ROIs with Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision. Uses explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention with diagnostic regions. Jointly optimizes with prototypical network objective.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements: from 77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS (MRI) and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm better attention alignment.

Conclusion: Expert-guided attention supervision effectively bridges performance and interpretability gaps in few-shot medical image diagnosis, improving both predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Validated an automated deep learning tool for measuring Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) scores from CT-brain scans in older patients, showing strong agreement with human raters and correlations with age and cognitive impairment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantification of brain atrophy requires time-consuming visual rating scales, creating a need for automated brain image analysis tools to enable standardized, large-scale measurement.

Method: Developed and validated a deep learning tool using CT-brain scans from older patients (>65 years) divided into training, optimization, and testing sets (60/20/20 ratio). Compared DL-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) against trained human raters using mean absolute error and Cohen's weighted kappa.

Result: The DL tool achieved mean absolute error of 3.2 overall against human raters, with half of predictions having error between -2 and 2. Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45-0.41 between DL tool and human raters, outperforming human-to-human agreement (Kappa=0.28). DL scores correlated significantly with age and cognitive scores (p<0.001).

Conclusion: The automated DL tool accurately measures GCA scores without user input in real-world clinical scans, enabling standardized quantitative atrophy measurement at scale for health data research and serving as proof-of-concept for future clinical point-of-care tools.

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models of 3D anatomy face a trade-off between controllability and anatomical realism, limiting their effectiveness for clinical research and medical device design.

Method: Uses interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space with geometric moment losses applied to selected tissues within multi-tissue segmentation maps to guide the reverse diffusion process.

Result: The framework achieves independent control over size, shape, position and supports composition of multi-component constraints during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a programmable and compositional approach that bridges the gap between controllability and anatomical realism in 3D anatomical generative models.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First dedicated dataset for stroke patients performing structured block transfer tasks, featuring 1,000 annotated videos with two modalities to enable objective assessment of upper extremity motor function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical assessment of upper extremity function after stroke is subjective and lacks sensitivity for detecting subtle motor improvements. Existing datasets focus on daily living activities rather than clinically structured assessments, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: Created StrokeVision-Bench dataset with 1,000 annotated videos of stroke patients performing block transfer tasks, categorized into four action classes. Provided both raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. Benchmarked state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action classification methods.

Result: Established performance baselines for automated assessment of stroke rehabilitation using structured block transfer tasks. The dataset enables objective, quantitative analysis of motor function recovery.

Conclusion: StrokeVision-Bench addresses critical gaps in stroke rehabilitation assessment by providing the first dedicated dataset for clinically structured tasks, facilitating future research in automated, objective evaluation of upper extremity motor function recovery.

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of
upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying
heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity
limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

### [238] [Physics-Guided Rectified Flow for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08330)
*Juntai Zeng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes PGRF - a physics-guided rectified flow framework for low-light RAW image enhancement that combines a novel composite noise model with per-pixel calibration and rectified flow generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets for low-light RAW enhancement only consider additive noise, ignore multiplicative components, and use global calibration that overlooks pixel-level manufacturing variations, leading to inaccurate noise reproduction.

Method: Derives a noise model from physical noise generation mechanisms, proposes composite additive+multiplicative noise model, introduces physics-based per-pixel noise simulation and calibration, and combines with rectified flow generative framework (PGRF).

Result: Developed LLID dataset (indoor low-light benchmark) and experimental results show significant improvements in low-light RAW image enhancement performance.

Conclusion: The proposed PGRF framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by accurately modeling real sensor noise through physics-guided per-pixel calibration and rectified flow generation.

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-ViT model achieves best performance (0.9443 recall) on limited and imbalanced datasets while maintaining training efficiency comparable to transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore architectural strengths of hybrid CNN-ViT models when trained from scratch on small, imbalanced datasets, combining benefits of both architectures.

Method: Trained hybrid CNN-ViT model from scratch on varied data fractions with both balanced and imbalanced training datasets, comparing against standalone CNN and ViT models.

Result: Hybrid model achieved highest recall of 0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistent F1 score around 0.85, outperforming both CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets with comparable training time to transformers.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-ViT model demonstrates reliability in diagnosis tasks and effectively complements the strengths of both architectures, making it suitable for limited and imbalanced data scenarios.

Abstract: This research explored the hybridization of CNN and ViT within a training
dataset of limited size, and introduced a distinct class imbalance. The
training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and
experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid
model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced
and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model,
complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of
0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85,
suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all
data fractions.

*Lauren H. Cooke,Matthias Jung,Jan M. Brendel,Nora M. Kerkovits,Borek Foldyna,Michael T. Lu,Vineet K. Raghu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RoentMod is a counterfactual image editing framework that generates realistic chest X-rays with synthetic pathology to detect and fix shortcut learning in medical AI models, improving model performance by 3-19% AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray interpretation are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where they rely on spurious correlations rather than clinically relevant features, limiting their specificity and reliability.

Method: Combines open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with image-to-image modification model to create anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified synthetic pathology while preserving original anatomical features.

Result: RoentMod images appeared realistic in 93% of cases, correctly incorporated findings in 89-99% of cases. Training with counterfactual images improved model discrimination by 3-19% AUC internally and 1-11% for 5/6 pathologies externally.

Conclusion: RoentMod is an effective tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI, enhancing robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models with generalizable applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

*Tam Thuc Do,Philip A. Chou,Gene Cheung*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A multi-resolution B-spline projection framework for lossy 3D point cloud attribute compression using differentiable RD optimization with sparsity-promoting regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient lossy compression method for 3D point cloud attributes that leverages available geometry information and provides multi-resolution representation with optimized rate-distortion performance.

Method: Projects attribute function onto nested B-spline subspaces, computes coefficients via differentiable RD optimization using l1-norm sparsity regularization, and employs data-driven coarse-to-fine prediction adjustment between resolutions.

Result: The method produces a differentiable end-to-end compression framework that can efficiently represent 3D attributes across multiple resolutions with optimized rate-distortion trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-resolution B-spline projection with differentiable RD optimization provides an effective framework for lossy 3D point cloud attribute compression that can be optimized in a data-driven manner.

Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the
problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline
projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first
projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0}
\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where
$\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis
function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected
low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of
a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network,
where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the
projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine
predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction
from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a
data-driven manner.

TL;DR: FlexiFlow is a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level intelligence using flexible electronics, optimizing carbon footprint through application-specific architectural choices and achieving 1.62X-14.5X carbon reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computing designs don't account for the 1000X variation in operational lifetime of disposable products like food packaging and medical patches, requiring new approaches for trillion-item deployment scales.

Method: Developed FlexiBench workload suite, FlexiBits area-optimized RISC-V cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths, and carbon-aware model for optimal architecture selection based on deployment characteristics.

Result: Achieved 2.65X-3.50X better energy efficiency per workload execution, 1.62X carbon reduction through microarchitectural design, and 14.5X reduction through algorithmic decisions. Validated with 30.9kHz operation using flexible electronics PDK.

Conclusion: FlexiFlow enables sustainable computing at the Extreme Edge by reevaluating conventional design methodologies to account for new constraints in disposable electronics applications.

Abstract: We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level
intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable
products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages
natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than
silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our
insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment
patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime,
fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering
trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we
model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon
footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1)
FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from
spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V
cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy
efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects
optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that
lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X,
while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate
our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics
with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables
exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design
methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and
considerations.

*Jingyuan Wang,Junhua Li*

TL;DR: Proposed Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE) model enables classification across different BCI paradigms without retraining, using brain-region partitioning and attention mechanisms to handle EEG channel heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models can only decode single BCI paradigms, but cannot handle multiple paradigms due to different channel configurations and task-related representations across paradigms.

Method: Uses anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding to standardize EEG channels. Local encoder learns shared features within brain regions using temporal and spatial attention. Global encoder aggregates features into paradigm-specific representations.

Result: Achieved average macro precision 60.16%, recall 59.88%, and F1-score 59.56% across three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, driving fatigue) without retraining.

Conclusion: Successfully developed a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification that avoids retraining for each paradigm, paving the way for portable universal BCI decoding devices.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single
brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).
It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to
diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate
task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global
Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To
address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we
employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy
to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local
encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each
brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal
attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each
brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global
encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI
paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to
evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable
of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving
average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\%, 59.88\%, and 59.56\%,
respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for
cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for
each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but
simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of
portable devices for universal BCI decoding.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Collectives outperform individuals due to greater computational resources (sensory information, memory, processing capacity, action capabilities), despite coordination challenges, leading to collective intelligence phenomena like wisdom of crowds and division of labor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why collectives solve certain problems better than individuals and to develop a framework explaining how collective resource advantages translate into superior problem-solving capabilities.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework analyzing collective computational resources and apply it through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making to demonstrate collective problem-solving strategies.

Result: The framework explains established collective intelligence phenomena (wisdom of crowd, collective sensing, division of labor, cultural learning) and generates testable predictions about distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioral switching.

Conclusion: Collectives leverage their superior computational resources to not only solve problems more effectively than individuals but also employ qualitatively different problem-solving strategies that emerge from their distributed, modular structures.

Abstract: Why do collectives outperform individuals when solving some problems?
Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more
sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to
act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges
in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed,
modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource
advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence
including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and
cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about
collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent
behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and
decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational
resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by
using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual adjustment of objective function weights in seed implant brachytherapy planning leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal treatment results, necessitating an automated optimization approach.

Method: Integration of locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM with automatic planning algorithm in iterative loop, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain knowledge enhancement, with weight optimization until convergence criteria are met.

Result: Validated on 23 patient cases, showing plans comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans in dose homogeneity for CTV and OAR sparing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of LLMs for automating SIBT planning and improving treatment plan quality through adaptive weight optimization.

Abstract: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality;
however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective
function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study
proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by
large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated
with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed
weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next
iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after
which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan.
A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed
method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted
approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved
and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target
volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the
potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.

TL;DR: Facet is a steerable GNN architecture that dramatically reduces computational costs for ML potentials while maintaining accuracy, enabling 10x faster training through spline-based distance encoding and efficient equivariant layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of first-principles calculations limit materials discovery, and existing ML potentials face bottlenecks despite steerable GNNs' ability to respect atomic symmetries.

Method: Replaces expensive MLPs with splines for interatomic distances, introduces general-purpose equivariant layer using spherical grid projection with standard MLPs instead of tensor products.

Result: Matches leading models with far fewer parameters and <10% training compute, runs 2x faster than MACE on crystal relaxation, reduces SevenNet-0 parameters by >25% with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Facet enables >10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.

Abstract: Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of
first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict
energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face
computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode
geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation,
rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet
maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,
and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.
We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed
through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include
replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances
with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory
demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node
information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster
than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the
MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under
10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as
fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by
over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster
training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially
reshaping computational materials discovery.

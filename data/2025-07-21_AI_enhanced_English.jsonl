In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields.

Yet, access\nto large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of\nrobust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,\nand robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly\navailable diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -\n2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with\ntype 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support\nresearchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes\ndatasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with\ndata selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood\nglucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through\nthis case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction\nacross all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML\ncollection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different\nprediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings\nfrom this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust\nAI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain.

This paper presents the first\nsystematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce\nMulti-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures\nthat facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational\ncost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public\ndatasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our\nanalysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant\nfactor (Friedman test: $\\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance\nvarying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple\nhorizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal\nscans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and\nprovide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the\nperformance of Mamba models in medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies the impact of patch scan order in Vision Mamba models for MRI segmentation, introducing MS2D to explore scan paths efficiently.

Conclusion: The 2COOOL workshop aims to inspire development of safer autonomous driving systems by addressing critical novelty handling challenges through interdisciplinary research and industry collaboration.

Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest model achieved 85.4% accuracy for automated dental condition classification in panoramic X-rays, outperforming custom CNN and pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated deep learning methods for classifying dental conditions (fillings, cavities, implants, impacted teeth) from panoramic X-ray images to support dental diagnostics.

Method: Used dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert annotations. Evaluated three approaches: custom CNN, hybrid CNN+traditional classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained models (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50) with 5-fold cross validation.

Result: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest achieved best performance (85.4% accuracy), surpassing custom CNN (74.3%) and pre-trained models (VGG16: 82.3%). Hybrid models improved discrimination of morphologically similar conditions.

Conclusion: Combining CNN feature extraction with ensemble classifiers provides efficient, reliable performance for automated dental diagnostics, though larger datasets and clinical validation are needed.

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align addresses attention leakage in zero-shot appearance transfer by using Query-Query alignment instead of Query-Key alignment, with three key components: Query-Query alignment for spatial mapping, Key-Value rearrangement for feature correspondence, and attention refinement for semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image generation models faces attention leakage problems where semantic mapping between images is incorrectly captured by Query-Key alignment, leading to poor transfer quality.

Method: Proposes Q-Align with three core components: 1) Query-Query alignment for sophisticated spatial semantic mapping, 2) Key-Value rearrangement to enhance feature correspondence, and 3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

Conclusion: Q-Align effectively mitigates attention leakage and improves semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer through its novel Query-Query alignment approach and complementary techniques.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache is a caching framework that accelerates diffusion model inference by 2x while maintaining quality through error analysis and correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational overhead due to iterative inference, and naive feature caching causes quality degradation that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes ERTACache with offline residual profiling, dynamic integration interval adjustment, and analytical error approximation through residual linearization to rectify feature shift and step amplification errors.

Result: Achieves 2x inference speedup across image and video generation benchmarks while preserving or improving visual quality, with minimal VBench degradation on Wan2.1 video diffusion model.

Conclusion: ERTACache enables efficient and accurate sampling with aggressive cache reuse, significantly improving diffusion model efficiency while maintaining baseline fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TVS is a temporal visual screening method that improves Video-LLMs by focusing on critical video segments and simplifying queries while maintaining answer consistency, achieving significant performance gains in both training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision, unlike humans who naturally perform temporal screening.

Method: Proposes Temporal Visual Screening (TVS) that: (1) retains focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructs queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) maintains invariance and consistency for any answer. TVS serves as a modular front-end adapter for both training and inference pipelines.

Result: TVS achieves relative gains of 7.33% in training and 34.6% in inference. The proposed baseline ReSimplifyIt outperforms prior approaches by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while maintaining competitive query rewriting performance.

Conclusion: Temporal visual screening effectively improves video-language understanding by optimizing reasoning burden distribution and cognitive load, enabling better alignment between queries and focus-critical visual information.

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROBUST-MIPS, a surgical tool pose and instance segmentation dataset derived from ROBUST-MIS, arguing that skeletal pose annotations are more efficient than segmentation for surgical tool localization while maintaining semantic richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for surgical tool localization rely on segmentation annotations which are time-consuming and limit dataset growth. The authors propose pose annotations as a more efficient alternative that balances semantic information with annotation ease.

Method: The authors created ROBUST-MIPS by enriching the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset with tool pose annotations. They developed custom annotation software and established a benchmark using popular pose estimation methods to evaluate the effectiveness of pose annotations.

Result: The study demonstrates that pose annotations yield high-quality results for surgical tool localization, showing that this annotation approach is adequate and efficient for the task.

Conclusion: Skeletal pose annotations represent a viable and efficient alternative to segmentation for surgical tool localization, enabling accelerated growth of annotated datasets. The released dataset, benchmark models, and annotation software aim to encourage adoption of this annotation style in the field.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch that reduces unsafe content generation in Text-to-Image models to 7% while maintaining benign image quality, outperforming existing safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I safety mechanisms are susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments, creating a need for more robust and adaptable safety solutions.

Method: Uses data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions to inject safety control signals into locked T2I models as a patch-like update. Developers can create various safety patches that can be merged into a unified patch.

Result: Reduces unsafe content generation to 7% compared to ~20% for baseline methods, maintains benign image quality and text alignment, and works across six diverse T2I models with similar architectures.

Conclusion: Safe-Control provides an effective, adaptable plug-and-play solution that significantly outperforms existing safety mechanisms in preventing unsafe content generation while preserving model performance on safe content.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV is a novel method for identifying target regions from natural language instructions and front camera images, specifically addressing challenges with stuff-type targets, absent targets, and multiple targets through joint existence prediction and segmentation mask generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underperform in handling stuff-type target regions with ambiguous boundaries, as well as cases with absent or multiple targets in navigation tasks using natural language instructions and visual inputs.

Method: Proposed GENNAV system that predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. Evaluated using novel GRiN-Drive benchmark with no-target, single-target, and multi-target samples.

Result: GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics. Real-world experiments with four automobiles in five distinct urban areas demonstrated robust zero-shot transfer performance across diverse environments.

Conclusion: GENNAV effectively addresses the challenges of stuff-type target region identification and shows strong performance in both benchmark evaluations and real-world deployment scenarios, making it suitable for practical navigation applications.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B is an auto-thinking MLLM that adaptively decides when to use step-by-step thinking based on problem complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use step-by-step thinking for all problems, which is inefficient for simple problems that don't require complex reasoning.

Method: Uses bi-mode annealing to enable both thinking and non-thinking capabilities, followed by Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) to improve decision-making on when to activate thinking. Trained on curated dataset with both modes, then refined under improved GRPO framework.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance across 25 benchmarks, outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks, and matches performance of larger models like Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: R-4B demonstrates efficient adaptive thinking capability, providing optimal performance while reducing unnecessary computational overhead for simple problems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

### [10] [HiddenObject: Modality-Agnostic Fusion for Multimodal Hidden Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21135)
*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject is a Mamba-based fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data to detect hidden or obscured objects, outperforming traditional unimodal methods in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB-based detection methods fail under adverse conditions like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations, creating a need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches.

Method: A fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism to capture complementary signals across modalities and create unified representations.

Result: State-of-the-art or competitive performance across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets.

Conclusion: Mamba-based fusion architectures significantly advance multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded conditions, and expose limitations in current unimodal and naive fusion strategies.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

### [11] [RadGS-Reg: Registering Spine CT with Biplanar X-rays via Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians Reconstruction and 3D/3D Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21154)
*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg is a novel framework for CT/X-ray registration that combines 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction with 3D/3D registration, achieving state-of-the-art performance on vertebral-level registration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT/X-ray registration methods suffer from spatial information loss and domain gap issues. Current 3D reconstruction approaches from biplanar X-rays are limited by dense-view requirements and poor performance with noisy X-rays.

Method: Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS) reconstruction with Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism focusing on vertebral regions, plus patient-specific pre-training strategy that adapts from simulated to real data while learning vertebral shape priors.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on in-house datasets for both reconstruction and registration tasks, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods by providing accurate vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through joint reconstruction and registration approach with attention mechanisms and adaptive training.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

### [12] [SYNBUILD-3D: A large, multi-modal, and semantically rich synthetic dataset of 3D building models at Level of Detail 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21169)
*Kevin Mayer,Alex Vesel,Xinyi Zhao,Martin Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D is a large synthetic dataset of 6.2M 3D residential buildings with three modalities: LoD4 wireframe graphs, floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds, enabling automated 3D building generation with semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated 3D building datasets for applications in architecture, energy simulation, and navigation by leveraging synthetic data approaches.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with over 6.2 million residential buildings represented through three modalities: semantically enriched 3D wireframe graphs (LoD4), floor plan images, and LiDAR-like roof point clouds, with semantic annotations derived from floor plans.

Result: A publicly available large-scale dataset (SYNBUILD-3D) that enables development of generative AI algorithms for automated 3D building model creation with semantic-geometric consistency.

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D provides a foundation for advancing automated 3D building generation and addresses the data scarcity problem in this domain through synthetic data creation.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at
https://github.com/kdmayer/SYNBUILD-3D.

### [13] [Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21190)
*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified approach for estimating homographies with radial distortion in three configurations: single-image distortion, identical distortion, and independent distortion across images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real images often have geometric distortions from camera lenses, requiring simultaneous homography and radial distortion estimation for accurate results. Previous methods addressed these cases separately.

Method: Proposed a novel unified framework to handle all three radial distortion configurations, developing new fast, stable minimal solvers that work with fisheye cameras.

Result: The new solvers are faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar accuracy, validated on established benchmarks including fisheye imagery.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive solution for radially distorted homography estimation with improved computational efficiency across all distortion scenarios.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCAV is a novel framework that unifies Concept Activation Vectors across different layers into a single consistent representation using contrastive learning and attention-based fusion, improving concept consistency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAVs computed independently at different layers often show inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons unreliable and limiting their effectiveness for interpreting deep neural networks.

Method: Leverages contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion mechanism to construct globally integrated CAVs. Introduces TGCAV for applying TCAV to GCAV-based representations.

Result: Significantly reduces variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept relevance, effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers, enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: GCAV provides a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts by integrating cross-layer information into a coherent framework.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP is a novel framework that enables object re-identification models to generalize to unseen categories using in-context examples as prompts, without retraining, by synergizing LLMs and vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ReID methods are domain-specific and require costly labeled data for new categories, while self-supervised learning struggles to capture identity-sensitive features needed for effective re-identification.

Method: VICP uses LLMs to infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, then guides a vision foundation model (like DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via dynamic visual prompts, aligning LLM-derived concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior.

Result: Experiments on ShopID10K dataset and diverse ReID benchmarks show VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories without dataset-specific retraining.

Conclusion: VICP enables effective generalization to novel object categories using only in-context examples, eliminating the need for costly retraining while maintaining strong performance across diverse re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegResNet models trained on small MRI datasets for pancreatic tumor segmentation achieved modest results (DSC 0.56 for Task 1, 0.33 for Task 2), showing challenges with anatomical variability and different MRI sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pancreatic tumor delineation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability.

Method: Used SegResNet models within Auto3DSeg architecture with 5-fold cross-validation and STAPLE ensembling, focusing on anatomically relevant ROI. Trained on two datasets: 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI cases (Task 1) and 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases (Task 2).

Result: Task 1: DSC 0.56, 5mm DSC 0.73, HD95 41.1mm, MASD 26.0mm, RMSE 5164mm. Task 2: DSC 0.33, 5mm DSC 0.50, HD95 20.1mm, MASD 7.2mm, RMSE 17,203mm. Performance decreased with different MRI sequences.

Conclusion: Results demonstrate challenges with small MRI datasets and sequence variability, but show potential for automated delineation. Emphasizes need for larger, standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

### [17] [Reverse Imaging for Wide-spectrum Generalization of Cardiac MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21254)
*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging is a physics-driven method that infers underlying spin properties from cardiac MRI images to enable domain adaptation and data augmentation, solving generalization problems across different imaging sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained segmentation models struggle with generalization across different cardiac MRI sequences due to contrast variations from different imaging protocols, despite being governed by the same fundamental spin properties.

Method: The method reversely infers spin properties (proton density, T1, T2) by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by a learned spin prior distribution from mSASHA dataset using a generative diffusion model.

Result: The approach enables accurate spin-property estimates that serve as interpretable latent variables for flexible image synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences, achieving highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts.

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging fundamentally solves the generalization problem in cardiac MRI segmentation by providing physics-driven domain adaptation and data augmentation through spin property inference.

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD introduces a personalized 3D human mesh recovery approach that first calibrates user-specific body shape then uses a shape-conditioned pose prior to improve 3D pose estimation accuracy from videos, outperforming traditional user-agnostic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HMR methods are user-agnostic and optimized for generalization, but they compromise 3D accuracy by failing to jointly account for person-specific body shapes and 3D pose plausibility while over-relying on 2D constraints.

Method: The pipeline decouples the process by first calibrating user's body shape, then employs personalized pose fitting using a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer with Point Distillation Sampling loss.

Result: The approach improves both pelvis-aligned pose accuracy and absolute pose accuracy, mitigates errors from over-reliance on 2D constraints, and is data-efficient requiring only synthetic data for training.

Conclusion: PHD serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance their performance through personalized shape-aware pose estimation.

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation framework with hierarchical temporal pruning that reduces computational costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate high-fidelity 3D human poses but suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements.

Method: Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy with three stages: Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning for frame selection, Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA for attention computation reduction, and Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner for semantic pruning via clustering.

Result: Reduces training MACs by 38.5%, inference MACs by 56.8%, improves inference speed by 81.1% on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed HTP framework effectively addresses computational inefficiency in diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation through hierarchical pruning, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume generates realistic synthetic 3D OCT fingerprints from 2D images to overcome data scarcity, achieving significant performance improvement in biometric recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT provides high-resolution 3D fingerprint data but suffers from high acquisition costs and limited public datasets, hindering deep learning development for biometric recognition.

Method: Three-stage framework: 2D style transfer, 3D structure expansion network, and OCT realism refiner using 3D GAN to generate synthetic OCT fingerprints with authentic textures and noise.

Result: Generated 420,000 synthetic samples and reduced Equal Error Rate from 15.62% to 2.50% on ZJUT-EIFD benchmark through pre-training on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real data.

Conclusion: Print2Volume effectively addresses OCT data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic 3D fingerprints, enabling significant performance improvements in biometric recognition systems.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLENDA dataset provides annotated laparoscopic images for endometriosis detection to support computer vision research in gynecologic surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of surgical recordings is time-consuming, and existing computer vision approaches lack sufficient medical image datasets, particularly for endometriosis detection in gynecologic laparoscopy.

Method: Creation of the first publicly available image dataset (GLENDA) containing region-based annotations of endometriosis in gynecologic laparoscopy videos, developed in collaboration with medical experts.

Result: Published GLENDA dataset - an annotated collection of laparoscopic images showing endometriosis (uterine tissue dislocation), addressing the data scarcity problem in medical computer vision research.

Conclusion: This dataset enables development of more sophisticated computer vision and machine learning approaches for automated analysis of gynecologic surgical recordings, benefiting treatment planning, documentation, and medical education.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

*Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Heinrich Husslein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates surgical instrument segmentation and recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos using a region-based fully convolutional network, achieving high accuracy for binary segmentation but facing challenges in multi-class instrument recognition due to high instrument similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical videos are valuable information sources but automatic content indexing for searchable medical archives remains challenging due to the specialized nature of endoscopic video content.

Method: Used a region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware instrument segmentation (binary classification) and instrument recognition (multi-class classification) in laparoscopic gynecology videos.

Result: Achieved high accuracy in localizing and segmenting instrument regions even with a moderately low number of training examples, but multi-class instrument recognition proved very challenging.

Conclusion: While binary instrument segmentation from background performs well, identifying specific instrument types remains difficult due to the high visual similarity between different surgical instruments.

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art masked autoencoder (MAE) methods and achieves competitive results across multiple datasets and testing setups. Rigorous ablation studies validate individual components.

Conclusion: SatDINO demonstrates superior performance for satellite imagery representation learning, with novel enhancements that can be independently applied. The approach effectively leverages self-supervised learning for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

TL;DR: A framework for generating 2D index maps and tissue profiling for Whole Slide Images to enable automated content analysis and AI algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSI collections lack standardized metadata, requiring manual inspection that is impractical for large datasets with millions of images, hindering AI algorithm development and cohort selection.

Method: Proposes a general framework with 2D index maps and domain-specific profiling mechanisms using common syntax/semantics. Organizes tissue maps into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, assigning WSI segments to specific classes.

Result: Enables automated content analysis and interoperability between different WSI catalogs. Provides fine-grained information about WSI content through detailed tissue mapping.

Conclusion: The proposed standard facilitates efficient WSI catalog management, machine learning applications, and graph-based representations, overcoming limitations of manual inspection for large-scale WSI collections.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: ICPL enables unsupervised incremental learning using confidence-based pseudo-labels instead of human annotations, achieving competitive results with supervised methods and outperforming class-iNCD methods by 5+% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require models to learn novel classes incrementally, but existing Class-Incremental Learning methods assume fully labeled datasets which is unrealistic in practice.

Method: Proposes Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL) that replace human annotations with automatically generated pseudo-labels, integrated into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection.

Result: ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates practical applicability for real-world scenarios with unlabeled data and shows suitability for resource-constrained environments through computational complexity validation.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. H. de With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedShift is a unified generative model for cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images, using Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges to bridge domain gaps without requiring paired data or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic medical data has scalability benefits but suffers from domain gaps that limit real-world applicability. The paper addresses the challenge of translating between synthetic and real X-ray images to improve generalizability in clinical settings.

Method: Proposed MedShift, a class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges. It learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports unpaired translation between multiple domains. Introduced X-DigiSkull dataset for benchmarking.

Result: MedShift demonstrates strong performance despite smaller model size compared to diffusion approaches. It offers flexibility at inference, allowing tuning for either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency. Outperforms prior methods that require domain-specific training or paired data.

Conclusion: MedShift provides a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging, enabling high-fidelity translation between synthetic and real X-ray domains with inference-time flexibility.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

*Dimitri Gominski,Martin Brandt,Xiaoye Tong,Siyu Liu,Maurice Mugabowindekwe,Sizhuo Li,Florian Reiner,Andrew Davies,Rasmus Fensholt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method for global-scale individual tree detection using 3-m resolution satellite imagery and simulated tree crowns with Gaussian kernels, trained on airborne lidar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale monitoring of individual trees is limited by inadequate modeling, as existing global products only provide binary tree cover or canopy height without identifying individual trees.

Method: Deep learning approach using 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery with simulated tree crowns using Gaussian kernels of scalable size. Training uses billions of points from airborne lidar data to detect trees both inside and outside forests.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with fractional cover R² = 0.81 against aerial lidar, balanced detection metrics across biomes, and further improvement possible through fine-tuning with manual labels.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring that is adaptable to future satellite missions with improved imagery.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

*Jiayu Yang,Weijian Su,Songqian Zhang,Yuqi Han,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M is a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework that uses hierarchical Gaussian organization and hybrid deformation/spawning to enable efficient training for dynamic scenes while maintaining high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has limitations for dynamic scenes due to large data volume and long training times per frame, requiring a more efficient streaming approach.

Method: Hierarchical organization of Gaussian spheres by scale with anchor-based structure, hybrid deformation and spawning strategy for motion modeling, and bidirectional adaptive masking for training efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: M provides an efficient and scalable framework for dynamic scene rendering using Gaussian Splatting, overcoming previous limitations in data volume and training efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Junha Song,Yongsik Jo,So Yeon Min,Quanting Xie,Taehwan Kim,Yonatan Bisk,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 125M-parameter image captioning model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, but suffers from visual blindness issues. A novel Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens component addresses these limitations through improved visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying multimodal large language models on local devices is challenging due to high computational demands. There's a need for lightweight yet effective image captioning solutions for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots.

Method: Developed a specialist model based on a 125M-parameter language model (56x smaller than LLaMA-7B). Created Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework with DeepLens component that extracts detailed visual representations by focusing on informative regions identified during initial glance.

Result: The lightweight model achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists. The framework effectively addresses visual blindness issues caused by ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations, enhancing caption quality through improved visual grounding.

Conclusion: Small specialist models can serve as strong visual specialists for on-device applications. The proposed framework successfully mitigates visual blindness limitations and demonstrates advantages over both prior small captioning models and large generalists.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: Foundation models show promise for AI-based dementia diagnosis but their integration into federated learning systems remains underexplored, requiring systematic evaluation of key design choices.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of federated FM tuning using large multi-cohort brain MRI dataset, evaluating classification head architecture, fine-tuning strategy (freezing vs full fine-tuning), and aggregation methods.

Result: Classification head architecture substantially influences performance, freezing FM encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard federated averaging.

Conclusion: Results provide practical insights for deploying foundation models in decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide future federated learning method development.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially

### [31] [Multi-Method Ensemble for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21463)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score that combines feature truncation and multiple scoring functions for superior OOD detection performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods focus on either feature truncation or scoring functions individually, and evaluate on specific OOD datasets, missing the potential benefits of combining multiple techniques.

Method: Theoretically and empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. Proposes MME score that unifies multiple OOD detectors into a single scoring function with aggregation of multiple scoring functions.

Result: MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Achieves average FPR95 of 27.57% on ImageNet-1K using BiT model, improving by 6% over best baseline.

Conclusion: Combining feature truncation with multiple scoring functions through ensemble approach creates a more robust and effective OOD detection method that works well across different OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

### [32] [Adversarial Patch Attack for Ship Detection via Localized Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21472)
*Chun Liu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes localized augmentation method for adversarial patch attacks on ship detection, applying augmentation only to target regions to avoid background interference and improve attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN-based ship detection is vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, and existing data transformation methods may cause false detections due to over-augmentation of background/non-target areas.

Method: Localized augmentation approach that applies augmentation only to target regions, reducing background interference and allowing loss function to focus on adversarial patch impact.

Result: Experiments on HRSC2016 dataset show the method effectively increases adversarial patch attack success rate and enhances transferability.

Conclusion: The localized augmentation method successfully improves adversarial attack performance by focusing on target regions and minimizing unnecessary background interference.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

### [33] [ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496)
*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELV-Halluc is the first benchmark for long-video hallucination in Video-MLLMs, focusing on Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH) where models generate incorrect outputs despite correct frame-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video hallucination benchmarks focus on short videos and oversimplify hallucination causes, missing SAH which becomes critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events.

Method: Introduces ELV-Halluc benchmark, analyzes SAH patterns, experiments with positional encoding strategies, and adopts DPO strategy with 8K adversarial data pairs to enhance semantic distinction capabilities.

Result: Confirmed SAH existence showing it increases with semantic complexity, found models more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics, achieved 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio and improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAH is a critical hallucination type in long videos that requires specific attention, and proposed methods including positional encoding and DPO strategies effectively mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-based upsampler network is trained to enhance low-resolution foundation model features using input image reference, enabling efficient and high-quality segmentation of microscopy images with minimal labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based vision transformers struggle with fine features in micrographs and large image sizes in materials/biological analysis, requiring computational efficiency while maintaining feature richness.

Method: Train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution foundation model features using the input image as reference, then apply this upsampler without further training to various microscopy images.

Result: The upsampled features enable separation of hard-to-segment phases like hairline cracks, and interactive segmentation produces high-quality results faster with fewer labels than traditional CNNs.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently enhances foundation model features for microscopy image analysis, achieving superior segmentation quality with reduced computational and labeling requirements compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCCM framework for drone vision-language tasks uses hierarchical cross-granularity contrastive learning and matching to address complex compositional semantics in drone scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance on retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone scenarios present challenges with wide field of view and complex compositional semantics that mainstream VLMs struggle with, as they lack fine-grained semantics and existing hierarchical methods require precise entity partitioning.

Method: Proposes HCCM framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC) that contrasts local visual regions with global text without precise partitioning, and (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM) that evaluates local semantic consistency within global representations. Also includes Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) for robustness against incomplete/ambiguous text.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval) on GeoText-1652. Shows strong zero-shot generalization on unseen ERA dataset with 39.93% mean recall, outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: HCCM effectively addresses the limitations of existing VLMs in drone scenarios by capturing hierarchical semantics without rigid constraints, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities for natural language-guided drone applications.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image 3D scene completion using Gaussian splats with latent diffusion model to reconstruct occluded areas and generate diverse plausible completions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian splatting fails on occluded/unobserved areas from sparse inputs. Conventional regression methods produce blurry, implausible results and cannot capture multiple possible explanations for occluded surfaces.

Method: Propose generative formulation using latent diffusion model conditioned on single image. Use Variational AutoReconstructor to learn latent space from 2D images in self-supervised manner, then train diffusion model over this latent space.

Result: Method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples that complete occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings from single input image.

Conclusion: Generative approach with latent diffusion enables complete 3D scene reconstruction including occluded parts from single image, overcoming limitations of regression-based methods.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort reduces pairwise comparison annotation costs by 90.5% using CLIP-based pre-ordering and automated comparisons, maintaining reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise comparisons are more reliable than absolute ratings but require O(n²) annotations, which is too expensive for large datasets.

Method: Uses CLIP model for zero-shot pre-ordering, initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and runs uncertainty-guided MergeSort with human-in-the-loop.

Result: Reduced human annotation by 90.5% vs exhaustive comparisons and 19.8% vs prior work (n=100), while maintaining inter-rater reliability.

Conclusion: Combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling provides efficient and scalable pairwise ranking solution.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

TL;DR: ECHO is a unified framework that recovers human pose, object motion, and contact from minimal egocentric tracking data (head and wrists only) using a Diffusion Transformer and three-variate diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling human-object interactions from egocentric perspective is important for wearable devices but largely unexplored. The paper investigates how much interaction information can be recovered from minimal tracking data.

Method: ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture with a unique three-variate diffusion process that jointly models human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence. It operates in head-centric canonical space and uses conveyor-based inference for sequences of any length.

Result: ECHO outperforms existing methods that lack similar flexibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance in egocentric human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed ECHO framework successfully demonstrates that comprehensive interaction information can be recovered from minimal egocentric tracking data, setting a new standard for flexible HOI modeling from wearable devices.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well general vision-language models (VLMs) handle urban spatial reasoning tasks, showing that fine-tuning with synthetic urban VQA data significantly improves performance, especially on challenging question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how current VLMs transfer spatial reasoning abilities to urban scenes and explore domain adaptation methods for specialized urban applications.

Method: Comparative study of BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5 using zero-shot evaluation and fine-tuning with synthetic urban VQA dataset generated from street-view images with segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions, paired with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought answers.

Result: VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, but fine-tuning with synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, particularly for challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals.

Conclusion: Urban spatial reasoning presents a new challenge for VLMs, and synthetic dataset construction is an effective approach for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains like urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM) - a generative trajectory method that learns underlying temporal distributions, can fall back to nearest image prediction, and supports 3D volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling.

Result: Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 4D medical image prediction.

Conclusion: TFM provides a robust baseline and unified approach for temporal medical image analysis, addressing the fundamental gap in fine-grained spatial predictions for applications requiring temporal dynamics understanding.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning framework integrating CT scans and pathology slides improves recurrence prediction in kidney cancer, with pathology showing stronger prognostic value than imaging alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Leibovich score for ccRCC recurrence risk has limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information, creating need for better multimodal prediction approaches.

Method: Modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox survival modeling, tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups using CT and whole-slide images.

Result: WSI-based models outperformed CT-only models, intermediate fusion further improved performance, best model approached adjusted Leibovich score, radiology added value primarily through fusion.

Conclusion: Foundation model-based multimodal integration is feasible for personalized ccRCC risk prediction, with future work needed for better fusion strategies, larger datasets, and improved CT encoders.

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Deep Unfolding Network for computer-generated holography that combines adaptive bandwidth-preserving modeling with complex-valued denoising to overcome limitations of existing methods and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based CGH methods have three main limitations: end-to-end networks ignore physical relationships reducing interpretability, CNN-based methods have limited receptive fields, and ASM-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.

Method: Proposes a Deep Unfolding Network that decomposes gradient descent into two modules: Adaptive Bandwidth-Preserving Model (ABPM) for wider working distances and Phase-Domain Complex-valued Denoiser (PCD) with complex-valued deformable self-attention to capture global features.

Result: Achieves PSNR over 35 dB, outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real data, and provides state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with improved flexibility and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed DUN framework successfully addresses key limitations in CGH by combining physical modeling with deep learning, enabling more accurate and stable holographic reconstruction with better global feature capture and extended working distances.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: Interactive PET/CT lesion segmentation using promptable nnU-Net with Euclidean Distance Transform encodings for user clicks, achieving improved accuracy over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for human-in-the-loop refinement in whole-body PET/CT lesion segmentation to handle tracer heterogeneity, physiological uptake, and multi-center variability while maintaining clinical workflow efficiency.

Method: Extended nnU-Net pipeline with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground/background clicks as additional input channels using Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings, with online simulation of user interactions and custom point sampling strategy.

Result: Ensemble of EDT-based models achieved strongest cross-validation performance, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models, demonstrating superior performance over Gaussian kernel encodings.

Conclusion: Promptable models with EDT encodings enable efficient user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT, showing potential for clinical adoption with publicly available code.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

*Fatih Erdoğan,Merve Rabia Barın,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel probabilistic projection mechanism for HD map construction that uses geometric mapping with confidence scores to improve accuracy and filter out hallucinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD mapping approaches struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often hallucinating non-existent road elements when using standard attention-based projection techniques.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores that starts with geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapts it to the scene, using confidence scores to refine mapping and filter irrelevant elements while improving temporal processing through selective accumulation.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets show improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, with particularly pronounced improvements on nuScenes and in challenging long perception ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates better generalization and accuracy in HD map construction by combining geometric mapping with probabilistic confidence-based filtering and temporal processing.

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

*Shashank Vempati,Nishit Anand,Gaurav Talebailkar,Arpan Garai,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes line-level OCR to bypass word segmentation errors, improves accuracy by 5.4% and efficiency by 4x compared to word-based OCR, with new dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Word-level OCR has shifted the bottleneck from character segmentation to word segmentation errors. Line-level OCR can bypass word detection errors and provide larger context for better language model utilization.

Method: Proposes transitioning from word-level to line-level OCR by processing entire lines instead of individual words, providing larger sentence context and avoiding word segmentation errors.

Result: Achieved 5.4% end-to-end accuracy improvement and 4 times efficiency improvement compared to word-based OCR pipelines. Created a new dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations.

Conclusion: Line-level OCR shows significant potential for improving both accuracy and efficiency in document image processing, with benefits for leveraging large language model advancements.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLORA is a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline using LoRA fine-tuning of Flux diffusion model, achieving superior object detection performance with only 500 synthetic images and consumer-grade GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large diffusion models that require enterprise-grade GPUs and thousands of synthetic images for dataset augmentation.

Method: Uses Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), dramatically reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Result: Achieves up to 21.3% improvement in mAP@.50:.95 compared to ODGEN baseline, using only 10% of the data and fraction of computational cost on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: Quality and efficiency-focused approach with FLORA is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation practical and accessible for real-world object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial inputs create detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations, enabling 90% detection accuracy without model modification through parallel entropy monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that cause misclassification, but existing detection methods require expensive retraining, architecture changes, or degrade clean input performance.

Method: Parallel entropy monitoring of CNN activations without any model modification, specifically analyzing entropy signatures in early convolutional layers of VGG-16.

Result: Adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early layers, achieving 90% detection accuracy with false positive and false negative rates below 20%. Clean and adversarial entropy distributions show complete separation.

Conclusion: CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in activation patterns, enabling reliable adversarial detection through activation entropy monitoring without compromising original model performance, facilitating real-time self-diagnostic vision systems.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with reading values from digital measurement devices in real-world conditions with clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur common in AR applications.

Method: Developed CAD2DMD-SET tool using 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition to generate diverse synthetic DMD datasets. Also created DMDBench validation set with 1,000 real-world images.

Result: Fine-tuning LVLMs with CAD2DMD-SET data yielded substantial improvements - InternVL showed 200% score increase on ANLS metric without degrading other task performance.

Conclusion: The synthetic training dataset significantly improves LVLM robustness and performance for DMD reading tasks under challenging conditions. The tool will be open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes SSL-SaN, a self-supervised sound localization model that handles negative audio cases (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) with improved training strategy, new evaluation metric, and extended dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual sound source localization methods perform poorly with low audio-visual semantic correspondence (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and are limited to positive cases with single visible sound sources.

Method: Proposed training strategy incorporating silence and noise, self-supervised SSL-SaN model, new metric for alignment-separability trade-off, and extended IS3+ synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Result: SSL-SaN achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval, with improved robustness against negative sounds while maintaining performance in positive cases.

Conclusion: The approach addresses limitations in handling negative audio scenarios and provides comprehensive evaluation framework, advancing the field of visual sound source localization.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

TL;DR: UItron is an open-source foundational model for GUI agents that addresses challenges in GUI automation through advanced data engineering, interactive infrastructure, and a curriculum reinforcement learning framework, achieving superior performance particularly in Chinese mobile app scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building GUI agents remains challenging due to scarcity of operation trajectories, limited interactive infrastructure, and foundation model limitations. The work aims to advance GUI agent development by addressing these systemic challenges.

Method: UItron employs supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks, followed by a curriculum reinforcement learning framework. It features systematic data engineering strategies and establishes interactive environments connecting Mobile and PC devices.

Result: UItron achieves superior performance in GUI perception, grounding, and planning benchmarks. It shows significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, with over one million operation trajectories collected across top 100 popular apps.

Conclusion: UItron propels GUI agents closer to real-world applications by providing advanced capabilities in GUI automation, particularly addressing the gap in Chinese language support and demonstrating the importance of systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-DCA improves domain generalization by enhancing domain awareness instead of forcing domain invariance, showing significant gains on challenging out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain generalization evaluation for foundation models like CLIP is inadequate because web-scale pretraining data may cover existing benchmarks, failing to test truly unseen scenarios. CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more out-of-distribution datasets.

Method: CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations) identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data, while encouraging domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from domain features.

Result: CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more out-of-distribution, within a challenging evaluation framework using 33 diverse datasets with quantified OOD scores.

Conclusion: Enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models, contrary to standard domain invariance approaches that can harm generalization by discarding beneficial domain-aware representations.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Atypical video data improves open-world learning performance across OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition tasks, with semantic diversity being more important than dataset size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how exposure to atypical unusual videos (sci-fi, animation, etc.) during training can benefit open-world learning capabilities, as most existing studies focus on common typical data from closed sets.

Method: Collected a new video dataset of various atypical data types, fed them into model training for representation learning, and evaluated on three open-world tasks: OOD detection, novel category discovery, and zero-shot action recognition.

Result: Straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improved performance across all settings. Categorical diversity boosted OOD detection, semantic diversity with smaller atypical datasets outperformed larger typical datasets in NCD, and semantic diversity helped zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: Atypical videos provide significant benefits for visual representation learning in open-world scenarios, with semantic diversity being a key factor, encouraging further research in this direction.

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

TL;DR: Proposes unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL) framework using Kernel Density Estimation of video features and novelty detection for dynamic memory expansion without labels or task boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in unsupervised continual learning for videos, which are complex spatio-temporal media not sufficiently explored. Prior work focused on supervised continual learning requiring labels and task boundaries, which is costly and impractical.

Method: Uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features from unsupervised video transformers as non-parametric probabilistic representation. Introduces novelty detection for incoming task data to dynamically expand memory clusters and enable knowledge transfer from previous tasks.

Result: The proposed methodology substantially enhances performance when successively learning many tasks. Evaluated on three standard video action recognition datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, Something-to-Something V2) without using labels or class boundaries.

Conclusion: Provides a realistic scenario and effective non-parametric solution for unsupervised video continual learning, successfully addressing the challenges of processing video data without labels or task boundaries.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep multi-stage cascaded nnU-Net approach with metric-aware ensembling achieves state-of-the-art PDAC segmentation from MRI, addressing data scarcity through strategic pre-training and specialized model ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated PDAC segmentation from MRI is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and limited annotated data, requiring robust methods for clinical applications.

Method: Built on nnU-Net framework with deep multi-stage cascaded pre-training from general anatomical foundation model, fine-tuned on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and target MRI modalities. Used five-fold cross-validation to evaluate augmentation schemes and training schedules, then created custom heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models.

Result: Achieved top cross-validation Tumor Dice scores: 0.661 for T1-weighted (Task 1) and 0.523 for T2-weighted (Task 2). State-of-the-art boundary precision with MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1.

Conclusion: The work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized high-performance models in limited data scenarios, demonstrating effective metric-aware ensembling for complex medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 outperforms previous models in radiation oncology benchmarks with 92.8% accuracy on multiple-choice exams and generates comprehensive treatment plans with rare hallucinations, though expert oversight remains essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-5's performance in clinical decision support for radiation oncology, specifically assessing its capabilities in multiple-choice exams and real-world treatment recommendation scenarios.

Method: Used two benchmarks: ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Exam (300 multiple-choice items) and 60 authentic radiation oncology vignettes. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated treatment plans for correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations using Fleiss' kappa for reliability.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 92.8% accuracy on TXIT benchmark, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Vignette evaluation showed high correctness (3.24/4) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4) ratings with rare hallucinations. Low inter-rater reliability (kappa 0.083) reflected clinical judgment variability.

Conclusion: GPT-5 demonstrates superior performance in radiation oncology compared to previous models but still requires rigorous expert oversight due to substantive errors in complex scenarios, indicating room for improvement before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

### [56] [TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21795)
*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMUAD is a unified anomaly detection framework that uses three complementary memory banks (text, object-level image, and patch-level image) to detect both structural and logical anomalies, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods struggle with limited normal data and often rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks that may not adequately capture logical relationships between objects.

Method: Proposes a Three-Memory framework: 1) Class-level text memory bank using logic-aware text extractor for logical anomalies, 2) Object-level image memory bank with complete object contours, 3) Patch-level memory bank for structural anomalies. These banks retrieve similar normal images and compute fused anomaly scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains.

Conclusion: TMUAD successfully unifies structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, demonstrating superior performance and providing a comprehensive solution for anomaly detection challenges.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoCap is a flexible video model that handles promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning using various input modalities (text, box, or mask). The model is trained on SAV-Caption dataset with pseudo object captions generated using VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental need for understanding objects in videos with fine-grained localization masks and detailed semantic properties, while overcoming the challenge of expensive manual annotation for such tasks.

Method: Propose VoCap model that consumes videos with prompts of various modalities and produces spatio-temporal masklets with object-centric captions. Annotate SAV dataset with pseudo captions using VLMs by highlighting objects with ground-truth masks. Train on SAV-Caption plus other image/video datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, competitive performance on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes a benchmark for video object captioning.

Conclusion: VoCap successfully addresses multiple video understanding tasks simultaneously and demonstrates the effectiveness of using pseudo-captions from VLMs for training when manual annotation is expensive. The model and dataset advance the field of video object understanding.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

*Yiming Lin,Yuchen Niu,Shang Wang,Kaizhu Huang,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that verb classification in scene recognition is inherently multi-label due to semantic ambiguity, proposes a single positive multi-label learning approach, and introduces GE-VerbMLP with graph networks and adversarial training, achieving 3%+ MAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat verb classification as single-label, but this fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition where multiple verb categories can reasonably describe the same image.

Method: Proposes reformulating verb classification as single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) and develops Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP) that combines graph neural networks for label correlations and adversarial training for boundary optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show more than 3% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: Verb classification in scene recognition should be treated as a multi-label problem, and the proposed SPMLL framework with GE-VerbMLP effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity and achieves significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA is a comprehensive benchmark for testing LLMs' driving knowledge, showing current models struggle with numerical reasoning, complex traffic scenarios, and environmental variations, but fine-tuning improves performance and enhances real-world driving task capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether Large Language Models can pass driving knowledge tests that require complete understanding of traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way principles, including edge cases rarely seen in real-world datasets.

Method: Created DriveQA benchmark covering traffic regulations and scenarios, tested state-of-the-art LLMs and MLLMs, conducted fine-tuning experiments, and evaluated model sensitivity to environmental factors through controlled variations.

Result: Models perform well on basic traffic rules but show weaknesses in numerical reasoning, complex right-of-way scenarios, and traffic sign variations. Fine-tuning improves accuracy, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decision-making.

Conclusion: Pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving task performance on real-world datasets, demonstrating that models can internalize traffic knowledge to generalize effectively across driving-related QA tasks.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

TL;DR: Architectural inductive biases with symbolic scaffolding and short-term memory improve LLM performance in Socratic tutoring, outperforming baseline variants and enhancing cognitive behaviors like abstraction and adaptive probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models in instructional dialogue, specifically examining how different architectural components affect reasoning capabilities in Socratic tutoring contexts.

Method: Introduced symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with short-term memory schema, conducted controlled ablation across five system variants, and evaluated model outputs using expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory with an LLM-based evaluation framework.

Result: The full system consistently outperformed baseline variants. Removing memory or symbolic structure degraded key cognitive behaviors including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity.

Conclusion: Architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs, supporting a processing-level account of how structural components influence cognitive behaviors in instructional dialogue systems.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based chatbots have limitations in scientific research including hallucinations, limited domain knowledge, and lack of explainability, especially in knowledge-intensive domains like Alzheimer's disease.

Method: Compiled 50 papers and 70 expert questions on Alzheimer's disease, constructed GraphRAG knowledge base, used GPT-4o as LLM, compared GraphRAG with standard GPT-4o responses, and evaluated traceability of RAG/GraphRAG systems.

Result: The study assessed the quality and traceability of GraphRAG systems compared to standard LLM approaches, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Provides an easy-to-use interface with pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test standard RAG and GraphRAG performance, demonstrating practical application for biomedical research.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO is an LLM-augmented framework that integrates multiple medical ontologies through dual-axis knowledge propagation (intra-ontology vertical and inter-ontology horizontal) to enhance medical concept representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single ontology systems or multiple ontologies in isolation, missing cross-ontology connections and limiting concept representation learning to intra-ontology relationships only.

Method: Uses LLMs for graph-retrieval-augmented initialization of concept embeddings, then performs dual-axis knowledge propagation: vertical propagation within ontology hierarchies and horizontal propagation across different ontologies at each level.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on two public datasets, with enhanced robustness in limited data scenarios and rare disease prediction.

Conclusion: LINKO effectively integrates multiple medical ontology systems through dual-axis propagation, demonstrating improved medical concept representation learning and serving as a plug-in encoder for EHR predictive models.

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

TL;DR: TiG framework enables LLMs to develop procedural knowledge through game interactions, combining language modeling with reinforcement learning to bridge declarative-procedural knowledge gap with high efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at complex reasoning but struggle with simple interactive tasks that require procedural knowledge, highlighting a gap between static declarative knowledge and dynamic decision-making capabilities.

Method: Think in Games (TiG) reformulates RL-based decision-making as language modeling task, where LLMs generate language-guided policies refined through online reinforcement learning with environmental feedback.

Result: TiG achieves competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods, while providing step-by-step natural language explanations.

Conclusion: TiG successfully bridges declarative and procedural knowledge gap, enabling LLMs to convert static knowledge into dynamic decision-making while maintaining reasoning abilities and improving transparency in interactive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM is a comprehensive benchmark for audio-language models that standardizes evaluation across 10 key aspects including perception, reasoning, bias, fairness, and safety, using aggregated datasets and standardized prompts to enable fair model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of audio-language models lack standardized benchmarks, measure limited capabilities, and omit important aspects like fairness and safety, making cross-model comparisons difficult due to inconsistent prompting and inference methods.

Method: Introduces AHELM benchmark that aggregates various datasets including 2 new synthetic datasets (PARADE for stereotype avoidance and CoRe-Bench for conversational reasoning), standardizes prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics across 10 identified important aspects.

Result: Tested 14 ALMs and 3 baseline systems, finding Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5/10 aspects but exhibits group unfairness on ASR tasks, while baseline systems perform surprisingly well with one ranking 5th overall despite only speech-to-text capabilities.

Conclusion: AHELM provides a holistic and standardized evaluation framework for ALMs, revealing performance gaps in fairness and demonstrating that simple baselines can compete with complex models, with plans to maintain it as a living benchmark with ongoing updates.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from academic AI research to practical applications faces multi-level challenges, requiring a comprehensive framework to understand both technical and economic aspects of AI development.

Method: Proposes a seven-layer AI compute architecture model (Physical, Link, Neural Network, Context, Agent, Orchestrator, Application layers) and analyzes each layer's development trajectory, key technologies, and evolution through three-stage LLM development.

Result: Provides a structured analysis of AI computing evolution, including Scale-Up/Scale-Out strategies, LLM development paths, contextual memory impact, AI agent trends, and ecosystem evolution from single agents to industry-wide systems.

Conclusion: AI development requires addressing both technical challenges across multiple architectural layers and economic sustainability issues, with predictions for future AI trajectory based on internet industry analysis.

Abstract: The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical
applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various
levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges
of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This
article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including
Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer,
Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains
how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the
three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we
describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we
discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies
on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development
paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs
and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss
the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI
agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.
Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the
economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the
internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI
development.

### [68] [A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)
*Christoph Beierle,Alexander Hahn,Diana Howey,Gabriele Kern-Isberner,Kai Sauerwald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies forgetting operations in epistemic states, proposing five general types and seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions, evaluated against a comprehensive set of axioms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between syntactical forgetting (variable elimination) and semantic forgetting (AGM contraction) by studying forgetting in richer epistemic states with clear links to propositional logic.

Method: The authors take an epistemic perspective, lift well-known forgetting operations to the epistemic level, propose five general types of epistemic forgetting, instantiate them with seven concrete operations for Spohn's ranking functions, and evaluate them against postulates from both logic programming and AGM theory.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of all seven concrete forgetting operations according to all proposed postulates, highlighting differences and commonalities among the operators.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel comprehensive overview of epistemic forgetting operations, demonstrating how different approaches to forgetting behave in epistemic states and providing insights into their properties and relationships.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [69] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Learning lifted STRIPS models from incomplete state-action traces where states miss predicates and actions lack full arguments, using a new STRIPS+ formalism and SYNTH algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the realistic scenario where observed states are not full STRIPS states (missing predicates like blank position) and actions don't reveal all required arguments, making previous approaches insufficient.

Method: Introduce STRIPS+ variant allowing implicit action arguments and limited existential quantification. Develop SYNTH algorithm that constructs stratified precondition expressions to ground implicit arguments from state-action traces.

Result: SYNTH algorithm is proven correct and complete, and shows scalability on traces from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

Conclusion: The proposed STRIPS+ formalism and SYNTH algorithm effectively address the challenging problem of learning lifted models from realistic, incomplete state-action observations.

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

### [70] [MMSearch-Plus: A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21475)
*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus is a challenging multimodal web browsing benchmark with 311 tasks requiring fine-grained visual reasoning, iterative search, and cross-validation under retrieval noise, where current MLLMs struggle significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow workflows using image search and text-masking, lacking genuine multimodal challenges like fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use.

Method: Created MMSearch-Plus benchmark using Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation method to seed questions requiring extrapolation from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts) and temporal traces to out-of-image facts. Provided model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools.

Result: Strongest agent (o3) achieved 15.1% without search and 36.0% with search rollout. Open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) got 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 search rounds. Error analysis revealed failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs face significant challenges in genuine multimodal web browsing tasks, particularly in fine-grained visual reasoning, iterative search propagation, and cross-validation under noise, highlighting the need for improved multimodal understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [71] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed a fuzzy inference system with Z-numbers to measure wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct using both wisdom scores and confidence scores, validated through moral dilemma tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wisdom measures rely on self-reports and fail to capture the inherent humility and uncertainty in wise reasoning. A computational framework that incorporates multidimensionality and confidence could improve psychological science and enable more humane AI systems.

Method: Used a fuzzy inference system with Z-numbers, where each decision is expressed as a wisdom score (restriction) and confidence score (certainty). Participants (N=100) responded to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemmas, with responses mapped to five wisdom components. Scores were combined using 21 rules with Gaussian kernel density estimation.

Result: The system produced dual attribute wisdom representations that showed modest but significant correlations with established scales while having negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity.

Conclusion: Successfully formalized wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct using Z-numbers. This approach advances psychological measurement and provides AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that bridges computational rigor and human-like judgment.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [72] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces counterfactual scenarios as a novel explanation paradigm for automated planning, addressing limitations of traditional counterfactual explanations by focusing on minimal modifications to planning problems to achieve desired properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual explanations in automated planning only show minimal plan modifications for different goals, but fail to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. This limitation motivates the need for a more comprehensive explanation framework.

Method: The authors propose counterfactual scenarios that identify minimal modifications to a planning problem P such that it admits plans complying with desired properties defined by an LTLf formula ψ. They present two qualitative instantiations based on explicit quantification over plans satisfying ψ.

Result: The paper characterizes the computational complexity of generating counterfactual scenarios with different types of changes allowed on P. It shows that producing such scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for P, demonstrating practical viability.

Conclusion: The proposed counterfactual scenarios framework provides a practical and computationally feasible approach for explaining automated planning systems by focusing on problem-level modifications rather than just plan-level changes, enabling better diagnosis and reasoning about planning problems.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI is a GenAI framework that simplifies process mining in healthcare by integrating LLMs for automated interpretation and report generation, validated with sepsis data showing Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro performed best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process mining in healthcare faces barriers including technical complexity, lack of standardization, and limited training resources, making it inaccessible to many potential users.

Method: Developed a comprehensive wrapper around PM4PY (Python) and bupaR (R) libraries, integrated multiple LLMs for automated process map interpretation and report generation, validated using sepsis progression data across four scenarios, and evaluated five state-of-the-art LLMs through OpenRouter platform.

Result: Framework successfully processed sepsis data demonstrating robust technical performance. LLM evaluation revealed Claude Sonnet-4 (3.79/4.0) and Gemini 2.5-Pro (3.65/4.0) achieved highest consistency scores when assessed by automated LLM evaluators.

Conclusion: The integration of structured analytics with AI-driven interpretation represents a novel methodological advance for translating complex process mining results into actionable healthcare insights, making them accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for discovering generalized landmarks that automatically extend across domains using state functions, enabling better planning through interpretable landmark graphs learned from small instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short in planning problems where intermediate goals need to generalize across domains and capture repetitive patterns.

Method: Learn generalized landmarks from solved instances using state functions independent of specific objects, construct directed generalized landmark graphs with loop possibilities for repetitive subplans, and use this graph in a heuristic for solving new problem instances.

Result: Generalized landmark graphs learned from small instances are effective for larger instances in the same domain, with significant heuristic performance improvement when repetition loops are identified.

Conclusion: Generalized landmarks capture interpretable domain information useful for automated planning and can be discovered from a small set of plans for the same domain.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems like multi-robot navigation can be effectively modeled using deterministic actions and observations, but current Dec-POMDP solvers struggle with large-scale instances.

Method: Proposes Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP), building on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework, specifically optimized for Det-Dec-POMDPs.

Result: IDPP is designed to handle large-scale Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers cannot address efficiently.

Conclusion: The Det-Dec-POMDP framework and IDPP solver provide a practical approach for solving large-scale multi-agent planning problems with deterministic characteristics.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Motivation: Bridge the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding

Method: Mixed-integer optimization model for inventory redistribution, integrated with LLMs for natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored KPIs through AI agents and RESTful APIs

Result: Case study shows improved planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing costs, and maintaining service levels

Conclusion: Framework successfully delivers interactive and explainable decision support, with future extensions planned for enhanced explainability and real-time decision-making

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) to an anytime version called A-MHA* that finds feasible suboptimal solutions quickly and continually improves them over time, inspired by Anytime Repairing A* concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA* can leverage multiple inadmissible heuristics for faster suboptimal solutions but is a one-shot algorithm that doesn't improve solutions over time and requires careful parameter tuning.

Method: Precise adaptation of Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) concepts into the MHA* framework to create an anytime version that preserves suboptimality and completeness guarantees.

Result: A-MHA* successfully extends MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion, finding initial solutions quickly and continually improving them until time runs out.

Conclusion: The proposed A-MHA* algorithm enhances MHA* with anytime capabilities while maintaining the original guarantees, demonstrating improved performance in 3-D path planning and sliding tiles puzzle domains compared to MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY is a medical AI framework that preserves diverse model outputs and biases instead of eliminating them, treating disagreements as strengths and hallucinations as hypotheses for clinician verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches view bias in medical AI as a defect to eliminate, but human reasoning inherently incorporates valuable biases from education, culture, and experience. The authors argue that bias presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable.

Method: Developed MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY) - a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than forcing consensus. Created a proof-of-concept using over 30 large language models to maintain both consensus and minority views.

Result: The proof-of-concept demonstrator successfully preserved consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. It showed how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision.

Conclusion: MEDLEY reframes AI imperfection as a resource rather than a defect, offering a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems under clinician supervision.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: PosterForest is a training-free framework for automated scientific poster generation that uses hierarchical document structure and multi-agent collaboration to optimize content and layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches neglect hierarchical document structure and semantic integration of textual/visual elements in scientific posters.

Method: Uses Poster Tree hierarchical representation and multi-agent collaboration with content summarization and layout planning agents that provide mutual feedback.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in qualitative/quantitative evaluations, achieving quality closest to expert-designed posters with superior information preservation and user preference.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses hierarchical structure and visual-textual integration challenges in automated scientific poster generation.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

### [80] [Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21730)
*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithm for TSP with compact permutation encoding and optimize-freeze-reuse strategy that reduces qubit requirements and eliminates costly structural research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem that is suitable for NISQ hardware by reducing qubit requirements and computational costs through circuit reuse.

Method: Combines compact permutation encoding with optimize-freeze-reuse strategy: first optimize circuit topology on training instances using Simulated Annealing, then freeze and reuse the structure while only re-optimizing parameters for new instances.

Result: Achieved 100% optimal trip sampling for 4 cities, 90% for 5 cities, 80% for 6 cities, but dropped to ~20% for 7 cities, showing scalability limitations for larger problems.

Conclusion: The method shows robust generalization for moderate problem sizes and dramatically reduces time-to-solution without degrading quality, but faces scalability challenges for larger instances.

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

### [81] [Orientability of Causal Relations in Time Series using Summary Causal Graphs and Faithful Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21742)
*Timothée Loranchet,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents theoretical conditions for orienting micro-level causal edges in time series using summary causal graphs from expert knowledge, even with macro-level cycles or bidirected edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experts can provide high-level causal abstractions (summary causal graphs) but full causal structures in time series are often unknown. There's a need to leverage this expert knowledge to improve micro-level causal discovery.

Method: The authors develop theoretical conditions that guarantee orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables, given a summary causal graph background knowledge and access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution.

Result: The results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even when the macro-level summary graph contains cycles or bidirected edges.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for using summary causal graphs to improve causal discovery in complex temporal systems and demonstrate the value of incorporating expert knowledge for better causal inference from observational time series data.

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [82] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP) is a zero-shot test-time planning framework that uses bi-level sampling with particle guidance and conditional denoising to overcome limitations of standard gradient guidance in non-convex, non-differentiable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient guidance performs poorly in real-world scenarios with non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Supervised planning approaches require task-specific training, limiting test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization.

Method: TDP frames planning as tree search with bi-level sampling: (1) diverse parent trajectories via training-free particle guidance for exploration, and (2) sub-trajectory refinement through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives using only pretrained models and test-time rewards.

Result: TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration.

Conclusion: TDP effectively addresses gradient guidance limitations by exploring diverse trajectory regions and leveraging gradient information across expanded solution space, enabling superior zero-shot test-time planning performance.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

### [83] [Automated Clinical Problem Detection from SOAP Notes using a Collaborative Multi-Agent LLM Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21803)
*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system that simulates clinical team consultation improves accuracy in identifying clinical problems from SOAP notes compared to single LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical narrative interpretation is critical but complex, and single LLM models lack the robustness needed for high-stakes clinical tasks.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system with Manager agent orchestrating specialist agents in hierarchical, iterative debates to analyze S and O sections of SOAP notes and reach consensus.

Result: Dynamic multi-agent configuration showed improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis on 420 MIMIC-III notes, though occasionally susceptible to groupthink.

Conclusion: Modeling clinical team reasoning offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBA introduces counterbias data augmentation that decomposes text into semantic triples and modifies them to disrupt spurious correlations, improving model robustness and reducing biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to poor generalization and performance degradation on unseen data.

Method: Counterbias data augmentation framework that decomposes text into subject-predicate-object triples, selectively modifies these triples to disrupt spurious correlations, and reconstructs text to generate counterbias data.

Result: CoBA improves downstream task performance, effectively reduces biases, and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CoBA offers a versatile and robust solution to address challenges posed by spurious correlations in deep learning models.

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

TL;DR: First large-scale German toxic speech dataset with age demographics, showing younger users use expressive insults while older users spread more disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits understanding of how different age groups communicate toxic content online.

Method: Collaborated with German public service network to create dataset with 3,024 human-annotated and 30,024 LLM-annotated comments from Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, using toxic keywords and platform-provided age estimates.

Result: 16.7% comments labeled as problematic, revealing age-based patterns: younger users favor expressive language while older users engage more in disinformation and devaluation.

Conclusion: Dataset enables study of linguistic variation across demographics and supports development of more equitable, age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit anchoring bias in price negotiations similar to humans, with reasoning models showing less susceptibility but no correlation with personality traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cognitive biases like anchoring effect in LLMs during price negotiations, as these biases affect LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Instructed seller LLM agents to apply anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using both objective and subjective metrics. Examined relationship between anchoring effect and factors like reasoning and personality.

Result: LLMs are influenced by anchoring effect like humans. Reasoning models are less prone to anchoring (long chain of thought mitigates effect). No significant correlation found between personality traits and susceptibility to anchoring.

Conclusion: Findings contribute to understanding cognitive biases in LLMs and support safe, responsible application of LLMs in society.

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs show poor performance on basic visual perception tasks despite excelling at complex reasoning, with accuracy dropping as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' performance on simple perception tasks using uncontaminated generated images with basic shapes and structures, which has received limited attention despite advances in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Created Percept-V dataset with 7200 program-generated images across 30 categories testing various visual perception skills, then evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) and LRMs (OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1).

Result: Significant performance drop with increasing problem complexity across all models and categories. MLLMs show similar accuracy trends across different cognitive skills, with some skills being more difficult than others.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs struggle with basic visual perception tasks, revealing a gap between their complex reasoning capabilities and fundamental perception abilities, suggesting the need for improved perceptual foundations.

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sci-LLMs are transforming scientific research but face unique challenges due to the complex nature of scientific data - multimodal, cross-scale, domain-specific, heterogeneous, and uncertainty-laden corpora that require specialized representations and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey with: 1) unified taxonomy of scientific data and hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, 2) systematic review of recent Sci-LLMs and analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, 3) examination of over 190 benchmark datasets with evaluation protocols, and 4) discussion of emerging solutions and future paradigms.

Result: The analysis reveals that Sci-LLMs require distinct data handling approaches due to scientific data's unique characteristics. The survey identifies persistent issues in scientific data development and shows a shift from static evaluations toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced protocols.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous Sci-LLM agents actively experiment and contribute to evolving knowledge bases, providing a roadmap for building trustworthy AI systems that accelerate scientific discovery through continuous co-evolution with scientific data.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: LLM evaluation scores are heavily biased by model identity labels, with Claude labels boosting scores and Gemini labels depressing them, causing up to 50 percentage point preference reversals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how bias affects LLM evaluations when models know the identity of the source model, examining both self-evaluation and cross-evaluation scenarios.

Method: Tested ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude evaluating blog posts under four labeling conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Used both preference voting and quality ratings (Coherence, Informativeness, Conciseness) with percentage-based scoring.

Result: Strong asymmetrical bias: Claude labels consistently increased scores, Gemini labels consistently decreased scores. False labels reversed rankings with 50pp preference vote shifts and 12pp quality rating changes. Gemini's self-scores collapsed with true labels while Claude's self-preference intensified.

Conclusion: Model identity perception significantly distorts LLM evaluation judgments, necessitating blind evaluation protocols or multi-model consensus approaches for fair benchmarking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM improves LLMs' ability to gather information through sequential Bayesian experimental design, achieving better performance in multi-turn conversations and preference inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' capability to intelligently and adaptively gather information from users or external sources in multi-turn conversational settings.

Method: Uses sequential Bayesian experimental design framework with expected information gain maximization, probabilistic modeling from LLM beliefs, specialized EIG estimator, and targeted query proposal strategies.

Result: Substantial performance gains across 20-questions game and user preference inference tasks compared to direct prompting and other adaptive strategies.

Conclusion: BED-LLM provides a principled approach for LLMs to act as effective conversational agents by optimizing information gathering through Bayesian experimental design.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HFACS methods for aviation accident analysis suffer from scalability and consistency limitations, requiring automated solutions for better safety analysis.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune Llama-3.1 8B model, incorporating multi-component reward system and synthetic data generation to address class imbalance.

Result: 350% increase in exact match accuracy (0.0400 to 0.1800), improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-flash.

Conclusion: Smaller, domain-optimized models provide computationally efficient solutions for safety analysis, enabling low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, with exact match accuracy proposed as new benchmarking methodology.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

*Han Yang,Jian Lan,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pixel-based language model replaces text embeddings with visual word representations to defend against orthographic attacks and support multilingual text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks using multilingual characters, causing performance degradation due to subword tokenizer limitations.

Method: Propose pixel-based generative language model that renders words as individual images instead of using text-based embeddings, providing robustness to noisy inputs.

Result: Evaluated on multilingual LAMBADA, WMT24, and SST-2 benchmarks, showing resilience to orthographic noise and effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Pixel-based representations offer stronger robustness against orthographic attacks and enable compatibility with diverse multilingual writing systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [95] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models do not show clear Critical Period effects in phonological acquisition, with delayed L2 exposure actually improving L2 performance and delayed L1 offset causing L1 forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Critical Period effects observed in human language acquisition (difficulty acquiring L2 with delayed exposure onset and L1 retention with delayed offset) are present in self-supervised speech models, given the importance of spoken language in human acquisition.

Method: Trained self-supervised speech models with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets on child-directed speech, then evaluated their phone discrimination performance.

Result: S3Ms did not exhibit clear evidence of Critical Period effects. Models with delayed L2 exposure onset performed better on L2, and delayed L1 exposure offset led to L1 forgetting rather than retention.

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech models do not replicate human-like Critical Period effects in phonological acquisition, showing different patterns of language acquisition and retention compared to humans.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

*Weizhi Gao,Xiaorui Liu,Feiyi Wang,Dan Lu,Junqi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMP accelerates self-consistency hallucination detection by identifying redundant prefix tokens and using selective inference with annealed decoding, achieving 3x speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucination, and existing self-consistency detection methods are computationally expensive due to repeated generation of redundant content.

Method: Identifies redundancy in self-consistency methods (shared prefix tokens), then proposes Decoding Memory Pipeline with selective inference and annealed decoding to accelerate generation.

Result: Achieves up to 3x speedup in multi-response generation without sacrificing AUROC performance.

Conclusion: DMP provides an efficient solution for hallucination detection that works across models, datasets, and decoding strategies, with potential for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

### [100] [Normality and the Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382)
*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the Turing test through the concept of normality, arguing it tests average human intelligence rather than exceptional intelligence, and that current AI models like ChatGPT target artificial smartness rather than true artificial intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and reinterpret the Turing test through the statistical concept of normality, challenging conventional understandings of what constitutes artificial intelligence and how it should be evaluated.

Method: Conceptual analysis of the Turing test using statistical interpretations of normality, examining both the target intelligence (normal/average human intelligence) and the judging mechanism (statistical aggregation of multiple judges).

Result: The analysis reveals that the Turing test requires machines to display imperfect, normal human behavior rather than exceptional performance, and that current large language models target artificial smartness rather than true AI as defined by the test.

Conclusion: Current AI models are unlikely to pass the true Turing test as they target exceptional intelligence, and the fundamental question remains whether human cognition can be reduced to average/normal mental processes, challenging the normalist paradigm underlying the test.

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility challenges and performance discrepancies in automatic text summarization evaluation metrics, particularly with the emergence of LLM-based evaluation methods.

Method: Conducted experiments across six representative metrics (classical to recent LLM-based methods) using a unified open-source framework applied to the SummEval dataset for fair comparison.

Result: Revealed structural trade-off: metrics with highest human judgment alignment are computationally intensive and less stable across runs. Highlighted concerns about LLM randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility.

Conclusion: Advocates for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

TL;DR: LLMs used as automatic review generators fail to detect flaws in research logic, showing no significant difference in reviews of papers with vs without logical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in scholarly peer review, particularly their ability to detect faulty research logic which is essential for high-quality reviews.

Method: Developed a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework to test ARG approaches under controlled conditions, isolating the skill of detecting research logic flaws.

Result: Contrary to expectations, flaws in research logic had no significant effect on the output reviews generated by state-of-the-art ARG approaches.

Conclusion: Current ARG systems lack the critical ability to detect research logic flaws, necessitating three actionable recommendations for future work and public release of the evaluation framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Motivation: Medical applications require highly accurate and professionally aligned responses, but existing benchmarks neglect critical clinical evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance, leaving medical reward models underexplored.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset with expert-annotated cases using a three-step quality process, evaluated 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, and developed baseline models through fine-tuning.

Result: Revealed substantial challenges in aligning model outputs with expert judgment across six clinically critical dimensions, but demonstrated significant performance improvements through fine-tuning of baseline models.

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench addresses a critical gap in medical AI evaluation and provides a foundation for developing more reliable medical reward models and judges that can meet clinical requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32

medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

TL;DR: Proposes DCSRM framework to identify fine-grained semantic subdimensions from word embeddings and validate their neural plausibility through brain activation mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic dimension approaches use predefined coarse representations that miss finer conceptual distinctions, limiting understanding of how meaning is organized in language and the brain.

Method: Introduces Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes LLM word embeddings into multiple sub-embeddings encoding specific semantic information, then uses voxel-wise encoding models to map subdimensions to brain activation.

Result: Identifies interpretable semantic subdimensions with neural correlates, revealing that semantic dimensions are structured by distinct principles with polarity as key decomposition factor.

Conclusion: The framework provides more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions that are cognitively and neuroscientifically plausible, advancing understanding of conceptual meaning organization.

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit ideological leanings with varying depth - some models have shallow, easily steerable political views while others show deep, robust ideological structures that resist manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and coherence of political ideologies in LLMs, as surface-level responses can be easily manipulated through prompt engineering, raising questions about whether they reflect genuine underlying ideological frameworks.

Method: Dual approach: 1) Measuring steerability using instruction prompting and activation steering to test how easily models switch between liberal/conservative viewpoints, 2) Probing internal mechanisms using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze ideological features.

Result: Models with lower steerability possess more distinct abstract ideological features (one model had 7.3x more political features than similar-sized model). Targeted ablation of core political features in deep models leads to consistent logical shifts, while shallow models show increased refusal rates.

Conclusion: Ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs, and steerability serves as a valuable indicator of their latent political architecture, with some models exhibiting deeply entrenched ideological structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents two AI-driven reward strategies (RLAIF framework) to enhance creative writing in 7B-parameter Small Language Models for Chinese greetings, showing superior results with principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have high computational costs, while current methods for Small Language Models (SFT struggles with novelty, RLHF is costly). Need scalable solutions for creative writing in SLMs.

Method: Two RLAIF strategies: 1) RM trained on multi-agent rejection sampling curated data, 2) Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge with adversarial training and reflection mechanism for direct reward signals.

Result: Both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines. Principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge yields superior generation quality, better training efficiency, and reduced human data dependency.

Conclusion: The principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge approach provides a more scalable and effective path for creative SLMs, with automated evaluation methods aligning well with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

*Sara B. Coutinho,Rafael M. O. Cruz,Francimaria R. S. Nascimento,George D. C. Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel automatic classifier selection method for fake news detection ensembles that prioritizes diversity through hierarchical clustering and performance evaluation, achieving top accuracy on 2 out of 6 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological biases make people vulnerable to fake news on social media. Ensemble methods help but depend on classifier diversity, which is challenging to achieve as models often learn redundant patterns.

Method: Proposes HierarchySelect: computes pairwise diversity between classifiers, applies hierarchical clustering to group them at different granularity levels, selects diverse pools per level, then chooses the most diverse pool while incorporating performance metrics for ensemble construction.

Result: Tested with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across 6 datasets from different domains. Achieved highest accuracy on 2 out of 6 datasets compared to Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed diversity-focused classifier selection method effectively improves ensemble performance for fake news detection, demonstrating the importance of systematic diversity selection in ensemble construction.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Result: MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity tasks in Marathi, demonstrating the impact of human-curated annotations and structured supervision.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses Marathi STS tasks through balanced dataset construction and targeted model fine-tuning, with publicly available resources for the community.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,
targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings. The

*Zinan Tang,Xin Gao,Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Mengzhang Cai,Jiang Wu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Middo is a self-evolving framework that dynamically optimizes LLM training data using model-aware selection and refinement, improving data quality and model performance through continuous adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection and synthesis methods for SFT LLMs are static and fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in improving data quality.

Method: A closed-loop optimization system with: 1) self-referential diagnostic module using tri-axial model signals (loss patterns, embedding clusters, self-alignment scores), 2) adaptive optimization engine that transforms suboptimal samples while preserving semantics, 3) continuous evolution with model capability.

Result: Improves LLM performance with 7.15% average accuracy improvement on multiple benchmarks while maintaining original dataset scale, demonstrating enhanced data quality.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models, enabling continuous improvement of both data quality and model capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Personality types influence LLM preferences: Rationals prefer GPT-4 for goal-oriented tasks, Idealists favor Claude 3.5 for creative/analytical work, with task-dependent preferences for other types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if users with different personality traits systematically prefer certain LLMs over others in multi-turn collaborative workflows.

Method: Study with 32 participants across four Keirsey personality types, evaluating interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks (data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, writing assistance) with sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback.

Result: Significant personality-driven preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4 for goal-oriented tasks, Idealists favored Claude 3.5 for creative and analytical tasks. Other types showed task-dependent preferences. Aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models.

Conclusion: Personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations miss, showing systematic preferences based on personality traits rather than overall model performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Misviz benchmark with 2,604 real-world misleading visualizations and Misviz-synth synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations to detect and classify 12 types of visualization misleaders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading visualizations drive misinformation on social media and the web, but AI model development has been limited by lack of large, diverse datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: Created benchmark datasets (real-world and synthetic), performed comprehensive evaluation using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers.

Result: The task of automatically detecting misleading visualizations remains highly challenging despite the new datasets and evaluation methods.

Conclusion: Releases Misviz benchmark, Misviz-synth synthetic dataset, and accompanying code to support future research in detecting misleading visualizations and reducing misinformation spread.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPI-FT framework addresses task interference in multi-task fine-tuning by identifying core parameter regions for each task, grouping similar tasks, and using parameter fusion with SLERP to integrate non-core parameters while preserving task-specific cores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning suffers from the 'seesaw phenomenon' where improving performance on some tasks degrades others due to indiscriminate parameter updates and task interference.

Method: 1) Independently fine-tune LLM on each task to identify core parameter regions 2) Group tasks with similar core regions 3) Use parameter fusion: transplant core parameters and integrate non-core parameters via Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) 4) Lightweight pipelined SFT training with mixed-task data while freezing core regions

Result: Extensive experiments show CPI-FT significantly alleviates task interference and catastrophic forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines on multiple public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed CPI-FT framework effectively mitigates destructive interference in multi-task fine-tuning by preserving task-specific core parameters while smoothly integrating shared knowledge, leading to superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENTAT method combines prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning to significantly improve performance on reasoning-intensive regression tasks where standard LLM prompting and finetuning struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI researchers need better methods for reasoning-intensive regression (RiR) tasks that require deep text analysis but have limited training data and computation, as current approaches like prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning encoders often underperform.

Method: Proposed MENTAT method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning to enhance performance on RiR tasks.

Result: MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baseline methods (prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders) on the established RiR benchmark.

Conclusion: While MENTAT shows significant improvements, substantial room remains for future advances in reasoning-intensive regression tasks, indicating this is an important area for continued research.

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PiCSAR is a training-free method that uses joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer to score candidate solutions in best-of-n sampling, achieving significant performance gains with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Best-of-n sampling improves LLM/LRM accuracy but requires effective scoring functions for reasoning tasks without ground-truth answers. Current methods struggle to identify correct reasoning chains.

Method: PiCSAR scores candidate generations using joint log-likelihood of reasoning and final answer, which decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence components.

Result: +10.18 improvement on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025, outperforms baselines with 2x fewer samples in 16/20 comparisons. Correct reasoning chains show higher confidence scores.

Conclusion: Joint log-likelihood scoring effectively identifies correct reasoning, making PiCSAR an efficient and powerful method for improving reasoning model performance without training.

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale datasets like Common Crawl contain indiscriminate web content that poses data quality, safety, and ethical challenges for LLM training, but prior research has been limited by computational constraints.

Method: Developed an ElasticSearch-based pipeline for indexing and querying LLM training datasets, applied to the 1.5TB FineWeb-2 corpus spanning four languages.

Result: Achieved fast query performance with most searches completing in milliseconds and all under 2 seconds, enabling real-time dataset analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical tools for safer and more accountable AI systems by enabling efficient analysis of training data quality and harmful content at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based methods for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems, outperforming traditional fuzzy matching and rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language models are unsuitable for clustering transaction counterparties in banking systems like SWIFT, which lack sentence structure but contain manual entry variations and noise. Traditional fuzzy matching tools are inadequate, creating a gap in fraud investigation and payment tracing capabilities.

Method: Proposed a hybrid pipeline combining string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based approaches that can handle unknown number of clusters. Also developed evaluation metrics based on precision and recall.

Result: Testing on real-life labeled dataset showed significantly improved performance over baseline rule-based (keyword) approaches. The method maintains interpretability while reducing manual review needs and better controlling risks of missing entity variations.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods for clustering transaction counterparties, providing better performance while retaining interpretability and reducing manual effort in financial investigations.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey paper examines reinforcement learning's transformative role in healthcare, shifting from predictive models to agentive clinical intelligence that makes intervention decisions with long-term goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how reinforcement learning represents a fundamental shift in healthcare AI - moving beyond prediction to active decision-making with long-term optimization, while addressing the unique challenges and opportunities in clinical environments.

Method: The paper structures the RL landscape including model-based/model-free methods, offline/batch-constrained approaches, and reward specification strategies. It comprehensively analyzes applications across critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, while examining ethical and deployment challenges.

Result: The survey identifies trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks in healthcare RL applications, and synthesizes lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning through information fusion of multi-source clinical signals.

Conclusion: RL represents more than just tools - it's a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments, serving as both a technical roadmap and critical reflection on RL's emerging transformative role as clinical decision intelligence rather than prediction machinery.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified EEG emotion classification framework using LSTM-GRU achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1-score 0.932) on binary valence and multi-class emotion recognition tasks using the GAMEEMO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-based emotion recognition studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or subject-specific classification, limiting generalizability and real-world deployment in affective computing systems.

Method: Structured preprocessing with temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and z-score normalization. Evaluated multiple models including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM on three classification axes: binary valence, multi-class emotion, and fine-grained multi-label representation.

Result: LSTM-GRU model consistently outperformed others, achieving F1-score of 0.932 in binary valence task, 94.5% in multi-class classification, and 90.6% in multi-label emotion classification.

Conclusion: The proposed unified multigranularity framework demonstrates superior performance in EEG-based emotion recognition, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses limitations of previous narrow-focused approaches and shows strong potential for real-world affective computing applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

*Wenfeng Feng,Penghong Zhao,Guochao Jiang,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVPO is a critic-free RL method that uses advantage reference anchors and data pre-sampling to improve efficiency and avoid local optima in group policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing critic-free RL methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within policies, which can lead to local optima and high computational costs.

Method: Uses a reference model to rollout in advance and calculate reward scores as reference anchors, plus data pre-sampling to select high-gain samples based on difficulty assessment.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on nine datasets across two domains, demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, and shows scalable performance across different model scales.

Conclusion: PVPO effectively corrects cumulative bias from intra-group comparisons, reduces reliance on multiple rollouts, and improves training efficiency through intelligent data selection.

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

*Tatyana Matveeva,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGram is a full-matrix adaptive optimizer that uses symmetric factorization and low-rank approximations to enable efficient parameter correlation modeling while maintaining scalability for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagonal adaptive methods like Adagrad cannot capture parameter correlations, while full-matrix methods are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optimization.

Method: Uses fast symmetric factorization for preconditioned updates and maintains low-rank preconditioner structure using matrix integrator methods to reduce memory and computational costs.

Result: AdaGram converges faster or matches diagonal adaptive optimizers with rank five and smaller approximations on standard machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: AdaGram provides a scalable solution for full-matrix adaptive optimization in large models by efficiently capturing parameter correlations with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using BiLSTM with attention for 48-hour forecasting of temperature, solar irradiance, and humidity to support smart HVAC control, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with enhanced interpretability.

*Evan J. Chou,Lisa S. Locke,Harvey M. Soldan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) requires advanced anomaly detection to prevent costly disruptions. This study developed a comprehensive AI system combining machine learning, reinforcement learning, and LLMs to detect and classify equipment degradation in real-time multivariate time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSN facilities contain antennas and transmitters that degrade over time, causing costly disruptions and threatening spacecraft connections. There's a need to assist JPL engineers in pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data to maintain operations for future space missions.

Method: Researched various machine learning techniques for data reconstruction and anomaly detection through predictive analysis and statistical thresholds. Integrated reinforcement learning for severity classification and Large Language Models for anomaly explanation. Implemented a full data pipeline system for data extraction, parsing, and processing. Used an agentic AI system for complex reasoning to determine classifications and predictions.

Result: Developed a complete data workflow for DSN anomaly detection that connects data extraction, parsing, processing, and trained models. The system can fully reconstruct data, detect anomalies in real-time, classify them by severity, and provide explanations for each anomalous entry.

Conclusion: The implemented AI system provides a comprehensive solution for DSN anomaly detection and equipment monitoring, with capabilities for continuous improvement through human feedback. This addresses the critical need to maintain DSN operations and ensure reliable spacecraft communications.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM routing as contextual bandit problem using PILOT algorithm with cost-aware policy for adaptive model selection without requiring complete inference across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised LLM routing approaches assume complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings, but real-world scenarios lack comprehensive mappings and face evolving queries, requiring adaptive decision-making.

Method: Develop shared embedding space for queries and LLMs aligned to reflect affinity, learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. Use PILOT (Preference-prior Informed LinUCB) algorithm with online cost policy modeled as multi-choice knapsack problem.

Result: Proposed framework enables adaptive LLM routing without exhaustive inference across all models, with cost-aware resource-efficient routing for diverse user budgets.

Conclusion: Contextual bandit formulation with PILOT algorithm provides effective solution for adaptive LLM routing in real-world scenarios with incomplete information and evolving queries, while handling budget constraints through cost-aware policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

*Joshua Ward,Chi-Hua Wang,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Gen-LRA, a novel membership inference attack for synthetic data that exploits generative model overfitting by evaluating test observation influence on local likelihood ratios without requiring model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on heuristics and unreasonable assumptions, showing limited capability to detect privacy exposure through synthetic data release.

Method: Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA) - a computationally efficient No-Box MIA that evaluates test observation influence on surrogate model's estimation of local likelihood ratio over synthetic data, requiring no model knowledge or access.

Result: Gen-LRA consistently dominates other MIAs across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack parameters in comprehensive benchmarks, outperforming in multiple performance metrics.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA is an effective privacy auditing tool that highlights significant privacy risks from generative model overfitting in real-world synthetic data applications.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs) improve traditional ESNs by using temporal residual connections in deep untrained RNNs, enhancing long-term memory and temporal modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Echo State Networks struggle with long-term information processing, limiting their effectiveness in time series tasks that require extended temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposed DeepResESNs with hierarchical untrained residual recurrent layers using different orthogonal configurations for temporal residual connections, including randomly generated and fixed-structure setups, with mathematical analysis for stability conditions.

Result: The approach significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling, outperforming traditional shallow and deep Reservoir Computing methods across various time series tasks.

Conclusion: Deep Residual Echo State Networks with temporal residual connections provide an effective solution for enhancing long-term information processing in untrained recurrent neural networks, offering improved performance over existing RC approaches.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FUTURE is a gradient-based unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles that uses probabilistic model approximations to enable efficient and effective forgetting of sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for tree ensembles are model-specific, rely on discrete tree structures, and are inefficient for large datasets, creating a need for a more general and scalable approach.

Method: Formulates unlearning as gradient-based optimization using probabilistic model approximations to handle non-differentiability of tree ensembles, enabling end-to-end unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FUTURE achieves significant and successful unlearning performance.

Conclusion: FUTURE provides an effective and efficient solution for machine unlearning in tree ensembles, addressing limitations of existing methods through gradient-based optimization with probabilistic approximations.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

### [129] [Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186)
*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a mathematical framework showing that next-token generation in LLMs follows a smooth trajectory through probability space, with temperature scaling time and sampling methods restricting the flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the intuition that token generation follows a smooth "manifold traversal" path and provide precise mathematical understanding of decoding dynamics in language models.

Method: Models next-token generation as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex, using multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) updates and analyzing the continuous-time replicator flow.

Result: Proves that for fixed context and temperature, next-token distribution follows smooth trajectory converging to softmax equilibrium; shows temperature acts as exact time rescaling; demonstrates top-k/nucleus sampling restrict flow to simplex faces.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous mathematical foundation for decoding dynamics, explaining temperature scaling and sampling methods as geometric constraints on probability flow, with implications for understanding hallucination-like behavior.

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

### [130] [Model-Task Alignment Drives Distinct RL Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21188)
*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterintuitive RL phenomena in LLMs only work when models already have strong task alignment; standard RL remains robust across all settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RL advances in LLMs show surprising patterns unlike traditional RL, but unclear when these counterintuitive results actually work or fail.

Method: Systematic examination of counterintuitive claims through rigorous experiments across different model architectures and task domains, measuring Model-Task Alignment via pass@k accuracy.

Result: Counterintuitive results (single example matching full dataset, inaccurate rewards working, negative samples outperforming reward methods) only occur with strong model-task alignment. Standard RL remains effective in challenging regimes.

Conclusion: Model-Task Alignment is the key factor determining when counterintuitive RL phenomena work; standard RL training is consistently robust while these techniques fail in difficult settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative continual learning framework using self-organizing maps and VAEs for memory-efficient replay without storing raw data or task labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory inefficiency in continual learning by eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Combines self-organizing maps (SOMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs) - SOM operates in latent space for high-dimensional inputs (CIFAR) and standalone for low-dimensional inputs (MNIST). Stores running statistics (mean, variance, covariance) for each SOM unit to generate synthetic samples for replay.

Result: Competitive with state-of-the-art memory-based methods, outperforms memory-free methods, improves single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 by nearly 10% and CIFAR-100 by nearly 7%.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning that also enables visualization and can serve as a generative model post-training.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning Mixture of Experts framework that combines three state-of-the-art neural network architectures (DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, FigConvNet) with a gating network to create a superior composite surrogate model for automotive aerodynamics CFD predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of CFD simulations is a bottleneck in automotive design. While ML-based surrogate models exist, no single architecture demonstrates universal superiority, creating an opportunity to leverage architectural diversity.

Method: Proposes a Mixture of Experts model with a gating network that dynamically combines predictions from three heterogeneous neural networks. Uses entropy regularization to prevent model collapse and ensure balanced expert contributions. Trained on DrivAerML dataset.

Result: The MoE model achieves significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming both ensemble average and the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities (surface pressure and wall shear stress fields).

Conclusion: The MoE framework establishes an effective strategy for creating robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining complementary strengths of specialized architectures in automotive aerodynamics.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) improves on attribution patching by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation coefficients instead of gradients, providing more accurate approximation of activation patching while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation patching is computationally expensive at scale, while attribution patching suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep non-linear networks. There's a need for a more faithful yet efficient method.

Method: Replaces local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which propagates network output backward with conservation properties and improved signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: RelP achieves significantly higher Pearson correlation (0.956 vs 0.006) than attribution patching for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large on IOI task, and matches Integrated Gradients' faithfulness without extra computational cost.

Conclusion: RelP provides a computationally efficient and more faithful alternative to both activation patching and attribution patching, particularly effective for analyzing complex components in deep networks.

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

*Hossein KhademSohi,Hadi Hemmati,Jiayu Zhou,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen is an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values for client contribution estimation in federated learning, achieving better accuracy with adaptive client selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating client contributions in federated learning is essential for fair rewards and faster convergence, but exact Shapley value computation is infeasible for large federations due to exponential scaling.

Method: Proposes FedOwen framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values efficiently, combined with adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploitation of high-value clients and exploration of under-sampled ones.

Result: FedOwen achieves up to 23% higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks under fixed valuation cost.

Conclusion: FedOwen provides an efficient and effective solution for client contribution estimation in federated learning, enabling better model convergence through improved client selection while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [135] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0 introduces a framework to measure cold-start adaptability by tracking cumulative errors during sequential learning, revealing systematic differences in early-phase efficiency across models and highlighting an adaptability gap compared to oracle performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model evaluation focuses on final accuracy while ignoring the cumulative cost of adaptation - the mistakes made while learning from scratch. This gap in measuring cold-start adaptability motivated the development of G&L.

Method: G&L measures adaptability through sequential labeling of unlabeled datasets. At each step, the learner selects an instance, predicts its label, receives ground truth, and updates parameters under online or batch modes. Four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained × Online/Batch) disentangle initialization and update frequency effects.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and AG News show systematic differences: smaller models adapt with fewer initial errors, pretraining benefits vary by domain, and all current models remain well above the oracle reference band, indicating a significant adaptability gap.

Conclusion: G&L provides a reproducible framework that complements conventional benchmarks by quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, enabling development of learners that are both accurate in the limit and reliable from the first examples.

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing

*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM framework for real-time anomaly detection in non-stationary time-series using continuous fine-tuning and LLM-as-a-Judge to handle concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline-trained anomaly detection models suffer performance degradation when faced with concept drift in streaming time-series data.

Method: Built on Apache Beam with TimesFm foundation model, featuring continuous fine-tuning mechanism and LLM-as-a-Judge component for semantic anomaly validation.

Result: Improves ROC AUC score in most datasets on TSB-UAD benchmark compared to static pre-trained models.

Conclusion: CALM's adaptive, LLM-guided approach effectively maintains high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

*Yibin Sun,Nick Lim,Guilherme Weigert Cassales,Heitor Murilo Gomes,Bernhard Pfahringer,Albert Bifet,Anany Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates domain shift detection in EMG signals using data stream learning techniques, revealing limitations of current drift detection methods for real-time EMG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in myoelectric activations are challenging due to EMG signal non-stationarity, requiring effective detection methods for stable EMG decoding models in real-world scenarios.

Method: Used DB6 dataset from Ninapro database, defined domains as time-series segments by subjects and sessions, applied KPCA with cosine kernel for pre-processing, and evaluated CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN drift detection methods.

Result: Current drift detection techniques show limitations in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals.

Conclusion: Streaming-based approaches show potential for maintaining stable EMG decoding models, but further research is needed to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical applications.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO is a lifelong learning framework that uses generative models instead of storing raw data to prevent catastrophic forgetting through wake-sleep cycle inspired consolidation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in continual learning including data privacy concerns, storage limitations, and performance degradation with dissimilar tasks by avoiding raw data storage.

Method: Uses wake-sleep cycle: wake phase learns new tasks and trains compact generative models; sleep phase generates pseudo-data from all learned models and consolidates knowledge via distillation into core feature extractor.

Result: Significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks on both computer vision (Split-MNIST) and NLP (Split-AG News) benchmarks compared to sequential fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: MyGO framework effectively prevents forgetting without storing raw data, offering privacy and storage advantages while demonstrating domain-generality across vision and language tasks.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [139] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA is a novel machine unlearning framework that improves parameter identification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous methods like FILA, achieving 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often unintentionally generate sensitive information, and retraining models to remove this data is computationally expensive. Existing unlearning methods like FILA have limitations in parameter identification accuracy and require access to all model parameters.

Method: VILA explicitly considers the fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information that were overlooked in FILA, enabling more accurate parameter identification for the forget set. It significantly reduces computational costs by identifying parameters without accessing the entire model.

Result: VILA achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA. It sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE.

Conclusion: VILA provides an efficient and accurate solution for machine unlearning that effectively removes sensitive information from LLMs without the need for full model retraining, addressing both computational cost and accuracy limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

### [140] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing convergence of Q-learning algorithms that use agent states (not belief states) and policy regularization, showing convergence to fixed points of regularized MDPs under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence behavior of practical Q-learning algorithms that use agent states (like RNN states) and policy regularization, which are common in practice but lack theoretical analysis.

Method: The authors analyze regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL), the simplest form of such algorithms, and prove convergence under mild technical conditions to fixed points of appropriately defined regularized MDPs.

Result: The analysis shows RASQL converges to the fixed point of a regularized MDP that depends on the stationary distribution induced by the behavioral policy. The framework also works for variants learning periodic policies, with numerical examples confirming theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first theoretical convergence guarantees for practical Q-learning algorithms using agent states and regularization, establishing connections between empirical practices and regularized MDP theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [141] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE improves sparse autoencoders by scoring features across token batches and sampling from a candidate pool, balancing global consistency with fine-grained reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TopK SAEs are inefficient as they treat all tokens equally despite varying information content, and BatchTopK causes activation lottery where rare high-magnitude features dominate over more informative lower-magnitude ones.

Method: Score feature columns of batch activation matrix using L2 norm or entropy, form candidate pool of size Kl, then apply Top-K selection from this restricted feature pool across tokens.

Result: On Pythia-160M, no single l value optimizes all metrics - best choice depends on trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family that provides spectrum between batch-level and token-specific feature selection.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stage-Diff: A staged diffusion model for long-term time series generation that handles complex temporal patterns and distribution shifts through stage-wise generation and progressive decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term time series present challenges with complex long-range dependencies, gradual data distribution shifts, and intricate inter-feature relationships that existing generative models struggle to capture effectively.

Method: Proposes a staged generative model using diffusion models with stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer. Uses progressive sequence decomposition for channel-independent modeling at different time scales, combined with multi-channel fusion modeling for inter-stage information transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.

Conclusion: Stage-Diff successfully addresses the challenges of long-term time series generation by balancing long-term dependencies with distribution shifts and effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies through its staged approach.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLGAN is a dual-layer GAN model that decomposes time series synthesis into feature extraction and reconstruction stages to better preserve temporal dependencies and capture original sequence features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series synthesis methods struggle with preserving temporal dependencies and accurately capturing original time series features when modeling on random sequences.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) sequence feature extraction and reconstruction forming a complete autoencoder for supervised learning, 2) GAN to generate synthetic feature vectors matching real sequence features.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate superior performance across various evaluation metrics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DLGAN effectively addresses temporal dependency preservation and feature accuracy challenges in time series synthesis through its dual-layer architecture combining autoencoder and GAN approaches.

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

*Bodu Gong,Gustavo Enrique Batista,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AHTSGD is a novel optimization algorithm that adaptively injects heavy-tailed noise during early training to enhance exploration and transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes, improving generalization and convergence to wide basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overreliance on training loss in large neural networks by leveraging insights about wide basins promoting better generalization, heavy-tailed gradient noise distribution, and the Edge of Stability phenomenon.

Method: Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD) dynamically adjusts noise injection - heavier-tailed noise early for exploration, lighter-tailed noise later as sharpness stabilizes, based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon.

Result: Outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and especially noisy datasets like SVHN. Accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings.

Conclusion: AHTSGD effectively promotes convergence to wide basins, enhances generalization, and remains robust to learning rate choices, making it a significant advancement in adaptive optimization for neural networks.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

TL;DR: Analysis of Leela Chess Zero's policy network shows strong monotonic performance improvement across layers, but with non-smooth representation development involving early solutions being discarded and late-stage policy divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural networks build representations through smooth refinement or complex computational processes, specifically examining chess policy networks compared to language models.

Method: Extended the logit lens technique to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, examining playing strength, puzzle-solving ability, and policy distribution trajectories across network layers.

Result: Found strong monotonic trends in performance improvement across layers, but policy distributions follow non-smooth trajectories with early correct solutions being discarded, poor move ranking correlations, and high policy divergence until late layers.

Conclusion: Chess policy networks exhibit fundamentally different representation development compared to language models, with non-smooth computational processes rather than gradual refinement, suggesting domain-specific architectural differences.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

TL;DR: PMODE is a modular framework for mixture modeling using partitioned data subsets, achieving near-optimal rates and supporting mixed distribution families. MV-PMODE extends this to high-dimensional settings, performing competitively on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general and modular framework for mixture modeling that can handle both parametric and nonparametric components while maintaining validity across different distribution families and scaling to high-dimensional problems.

Method: Partitions data into subsets and fits separate density estimators to each partition, building mixtures through this partitioning approach. MV-PMODE specifically scales this to high-dimensional settings.

Result: Achieves near-optimal rates for the estimator class, remains valid with mixed distribution families, and MV-PMODE performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection in thousands of dimensions.

Conclusion: PMODE provides an effective and modular framework for mixture modeling that works across different distribution types and scales well to high-dimensional problems while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using mobile network data to monitor network states through reservoir computing, showing performance correlates with network conditions and can detect perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-invasive, low-cost method for monitoring communication and mobility networks using readily available data.

Method: Transform mobile network utilization data into reservoir computing models (echo state networks), use neuroscience-inspired proxy tasks to measure model performance, and analyze how performance relates to network state.

Result: Performance on proxy tasks correlates with network state and visibly decreases when networks are perturbed, demonstrating the method's sensitivity to network conditions.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept approach shows promise for near-real-time monitoring and identifying weak spots in both mobile communication and transportation networks using inexpensive reservoir computing methods.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoM is a layer-wise merging method that addresses internal covariate shift in model merging by updating activation statistics auto-regressively, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging techniques treat layers independently, failing to account for inter-layer dependencies and causing distributional mismatches similar to internal covariate shift.

Method: Chain of Merges (CoM) - a layer-wise merging procedure that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly accounting for cross-layer interactions through conditionally optimal updates.

Result: CoM effectively mitigates degradation caused by covariate shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoM provides a coherent merging approach that properly handles inter-layer dependencies, addressing the critical challenge of merging specialized models without retraining.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Novel GAN-based framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing, showing improved performance with hybrid quantum/classical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous biomanufacturing requires robust anomaly detection as minor deviations can compromise yield, stability, and economic performance due to complex non-linear dynamics and intricate variable relationships.

Method: Ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for unsupervised anomaly detection, using benchmark dataset simulating normal/anomalous operations. Evaluated hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with simulated quantum circuit and real photonic quantum processor.

Result: GAN-based framework effectively detects anomalies from sudden feedstock variability. Hybrid quantum/classical approach yields improved anomaly detection rates compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum/classical approaches show potential for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes through enhanced anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

### [150] [Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443)
*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel RL algorithm that combines standard expected cumulative reward optimization with time-average growth rate to improve individual trajectory performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL optimizes expected cumulative reward (ensemble average), but real-world deployment requires good performance on individual trajectories, not just average performance.

Method: Defines Bellman operator for time-average growth rate, uses geometric mean under multiplicative reward dynamics, and proposes modified geometric mean with N-sliding window estimator for general reward dynamics. Embeds this as a regularizer into the objective function.

Result: The algorithm outperforms conventional RL methods in challenging simulations.

Conclusion: Combining ensemble average with time-average growth rate optimization enables policies to benefit from both approaches simultaneously, improving individual trajectory performance while maintaining good average performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

### [151] [Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466)
*Kota Fukuzawa,Atsushi Suzuki,Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML) that extends Normalized Maximum Likelihood to Riemannian manifolds, making it coordinate-invariant and applicable to hyperbolic spaces and other non-Euclidean data spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NML formulations are limited to Euclidean spaces and coordinate-dependent, making them unsuitable for Riemannian manifolds like hyperbolic spaces that are increasingly important for hierarchical graph data.

Method: Defines Rm-NML that reflects Riemannian geometric structure, extends computational techniques to manifolds, and derives simplification methods for Riemannian symmetric spaces including hyperbolic spaces.

Result: Developed coordinate-invariant Rm-NML that coincides with conventional NML in Euclidean space under natural parameterization, with explicit computation demonstrated for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: Rm-NML provides a geometrically appropriate extension of NML to Riemannian manifolds, enabling model selection and regret minimization in non-Euclidean data spaces like hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

TL;DR: CByG is a novel gradient-based conditional generative framework that extends Bayesian Flow Networks to address limitations in conventional SBDD models by integrating property-specific guidance for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBDD generative models focus primarily on binding affinity while neglecting critical practical drug discovery requirements like synthetic feasibility and selectivity, creating a gap between model performance and real-world applicability.

Method: Extends Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance for multiple pharmacological properties simultaneously.

Result: CByG significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria including binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications by addressing fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based models through comprehensive property integration.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

*Pascal R. van der Vaart,Neil Yorke-Smith,Matthijs T. J. Spaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian deep Q-learning shows a cold posterior effect where performance improves with lower posterior temperature, contrary to theory. Common Gaussian likelihood assumptions are violated, and better priors can improve Bayesian RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning improves exploration and robustness, but current Bayesian approaches focus on posterior approximation accuracy rather than examining the accuracy of prior and likelihood assumptions.

Method: Empirical study of prior distributions and statistical tests to challenge common Gaussian likelihood assumptions in Bayesian model-free algorithms. Development and testing of simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning.

Result: Demonstrated cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning where performance increases with reduced posterior temperature. Found that Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated through statistical tests.

Conclusion: Developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research, as improved priors lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

### [154] [Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495)
*Piotr Kubaty,Filip Szatkowski,Metod Jazbec,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early-exit models use confidence-based exit strategies, but calibration can be misleading. Failure prediction is a better proxy for performance than calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of confidence-based calibration in early-exit models, as calibration measures can be misleading and don't preserve sample ranking, leading to inefficient computation.

Method: Proposed using failure prediction instead of calibration as a performance proxy, as it accounts for sample ranking changes and correlates better with efficiency improvements.

Result: Demonstrated empirical cases where miscalibrated networks outperform calibrated ones, showing failure prediction has stronger correlation with efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Failure prediction is a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models compared to traditional calibration methods.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

*Vishal Pandey,Debasmita Biswas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNN-DT combines spiking neural networks with Decision Transformers for ultra-low-power reinforcement learning, achieving comparable performance with 10,000x energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based RL agents consume too much energy for edge devices, while spiking neural networks offer energy efficiency but haven't been integrated with return-conditioned sequence modeling.

Method: Embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into self-attention blocks, uses surrogate gradient training, three-factor plasticity, spike-based positional encodings, and dendritic routing modules.

Result: Matches/exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on control benchmarks (CartPole, MountainCar, Acrobot, Pendulum) with <10 spikes per decision, indicating 4+ orders-of-magnitude energy reduction.

Conclusion: SNN-DT enables real-time, low-power control on embedded/wearable devices by combining sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with tabular data fairness in loan approvals. Serialization format choice significantly impacts both performance and fairness across Ghana, Germany, and US datasets, with ICL improving performance but varying fairness effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes financial decision-making like loan approvals, there's a need to assess their performance and fairness with tabular data, particularly across different geographic regions.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and US, focusing on zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities with different serialization formats (GReat, LIFT, etc.).

Result: Serialization format significantly affects both performance and fairness - certain formats yield higher F1 scores but exacerbate fairness disparities. ICL improved performance by 4.9-59.6% but had varying effects on fairness across datasets.

Conclusion: Effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware models are crucial for improving LLM reliability in financial decision-making applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-based SAT solvers perform poorly on harder instances due to negative graph curvature in SAT formulas, which causes oversquashing and limits information flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Graph Neural Networks degrade on harder Boolean Satisfiability Problems and determine if this reflects fundamental architectural limitations.

Method: Analyze SAT formulas through graph Ricci Curvature to quantify connectivity bottlenecks, prove negative curvature in random k-SAT bipartite graphs, and empirically validate across SAT benchmarks.

Result: Found that bipartite graphs from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, curvature decreases with difficulty, and curvature strongly indicates problem complexity and predicts GNN performance.

Conclusion: Negative graph curvature causes oversquashing in GNN-based SAT solvers, providing geometric explanation for performance degradation and offering design principles for future solver development.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

*Jens Leysen,Marco Favier,Bart Goethals*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data minimization for recommender systems is technically feasible with substantial data reduction without performance loss, but practically challenging due to dependence on technical settings and user characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operationalizing the legal principle of data minimization for recommender systems that rely on extensive personal data remains a significant challenge.

Method: Proposed a novel problem formulation, analyzed various minimization techniques, and investigated key factors influencing their effectiveness for minimizing implicit feedback inference data.

Result: Demonstrated that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss in recommender systems.

Conclusion: While technical feasibility is established, data minimization remains practically challenging due to dependence on technical settings (performance targets, model choice) and user characteristics (history size, preference complexity), making universal standards for data 'necessity' difficult to implement.

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach

Conclusion: Not specified in the provided abstract excerpt.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine

TL;DR: This paper establishes linear convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent/flow in training over-parameterized two-layer Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are popular neural solvers for PDEs, typically trained with stochastic gradient descent methods. While previous work analyzed gradient descent, there was a need to establish convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization methods which introduce dynamic randomness during training.

Method: The authors analyze stochastic gradient descent/flow for over-parameterized two-layer PINNs with a general class of activation functions. The key analytical challenge is handling the dynamic randomness from stochastic optimization while ensuring positive definiteness of suitable Gram matrices throughout training.

Result: The paper establishes linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent/flow in the high probability sense, extending previous results that only analyzed gradient descent. The analysis provides insight into the optimization dynamics and guarantees for neural networks trained with stochastic algorithms.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization methods in training PINNs, addressing the practical reality that stochastic gradient descent is commonly used. The results extend previous gradient descent analyses and offer mathematical foundations for stochastic training of neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

TL;DR: This monograph provides an accessible introduction to theoretical analysis of probabilistic decision-making algorithms like bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search, aimed at making these analyses understandable to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision theory algorithms are valuable for data-efficient scientific discovery but their theoretical analyses are often inaccessible to non-experts, creating a need for a more approachable introduction.

Method: The monograph offers a self-contained introduction to theoretical analysis of probabilistic decision-making algorithms, assuming only basic probability/statistics knowledge and elementary Gaussian processes understanding.

Result: Not applicable - this is an introductory monograph rather than a research paper presenting new results.

Conclusion: This work aims to bridge the accessibility gap by providing foundational theoretical understanding of decision-making algorithms to enable broader adoption and development of next-generation algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

Motivation: To predict social media engagement metrics from emotional and temporal features of songs, understanding what drives different types of engagement.

Method: Multi-target regression using HistGradientBoostingRegressor on 600 songs with valence, arousal, sentiment metrics, and log-transformed engagement ratios to handle skewed data.

Result: Model achieves R²=0.98 for likes prediction but only R²=0.41 for comments, showing emotional/temporal features effectively predict likes but comments depend on additional factors.

Conclusion: Likes are driven by affective and exposure signals captured by emotional/temporal features, while comments require additional unrepresented factors for accurate prediction.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

### [167] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActSub: A novel OOD detection method that uses SVD to decompose model activations into decisive and insignificant components, achieving state-of-the-art performance by handling both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve OOD detection reliability for deep models in real-world applications by better distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, especially addressing the challenges of both large (Far-OOD) and small (Near-OOD) distribution shifts.

Method: Utilizes singular value decomposition of the classification head's weight matrix to decompose model activations into decisive components (maximally contributing to classification) and insignificant components (minimally contributing). Combines both subspaces: uses insignificant subspace for Far-OOD detection and decisive subspace for Near-OOD detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across various standard OOD benchmarks. The insignificant subspace proves more effective for Far-OOD detection as it remains unaffected by classification objectives, while the decisive subspace works better for Near-OOD by avoiding interference from insignificant components.

Conclusion: ActSub provides an effective unified approach for OOD detection by leveraging complementary properties of different activation subspaces, demonstrating superior performance in handling both large and small distribution shifts compared to existing methods.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

### [168] [Inferring Effects of Major Events through Discontinuity Forecasting of Population Anxiety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21722)
*Siddharth Mangalik,Ojas Deshpande,Adithya V. Ganesan,Sean A. P. Clouston,H. Andrew Schwartz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adapting Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) into a statistical learning framework to forecast mental health discontinuities and slope changes from local events, showing improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy, but traditional forecasting alone offers limited insights into causal impacts of events.

Method: Adapts LRDDs into a statistical learning framework that forecasts future discontinuities and slope changes using location's score history, dynamic covariates, and exogenous variables.

Result: Best results from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates, with strong improvement over traditional methods (r=+.46 for discontinuity, r=+.65 for slope) when predicting anxiety discontinuities from COVID-19 events.

Conclusion: Discontinuity forecasting enables estimating idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities, showing the framework is effective despite the difficulty of the task.

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAC developed SNL framework for real-time ML inference on FPGAs to handle high-speed X-ray data at LCLS-II FEL, with Auto-SNL tool that outperforms hls4ml in latency and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of processing 1 TB/s data streams from LCLS-II FEL X-ray experiments where conventional ML implementations introduce excessive latency and transmission/storage costs are prohibitive.

Method: Developed SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) for FPGA deployment with dynamic weight updates, and Auto-SNL Python extension to convert neural network models to SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code.

Result: Benchmark comparison showed SNL achieves competitive or superior latency compared to hls4ml across multiple architectures and fixed-point precisions, with FPGA resource savings in some cases.

Conclusion: SNL demonstrates versatility for real-time ML inference in high-speed experimental environments, enabling applications in high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and other fields requiring low-latency processing.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

### [170] [UniMLR: Modeling Implicit Class Significance for Multi-Label Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21772)
*V. Bugra Yesilkaynak,Emine Dari,Alican Mertan,Gozde Unal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMLR introduces a new multi-label ranking paradigm that leverages ranking among positive labels to model implicit class relevance as probability distributions, unifying ranking and classification tasks while addressing dataset scarcity through synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLR frameworks only use positive/negative label bipartition and ignore ranking information among positive labels, missing valuable relevance signals and facing dataset scarcity issues.

Method: Proposes UniMLR framework that models class relevance as probability distributions using positive label rankings, and introduces eight synthetic Ranked MNIST datasets to address annotation bias and scarcity.

Result: Statistical analysis shows the method accurately learns positive rank order consistent with ground truth and proportional to underlying significance values. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate framework effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniMLR successfully unifies ranking and classification in MLR by exploiting positive label ranking information, providing a more comprehensive approach that captures implicit class relevance through probability distributions.

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

*Peng Yang,Zhengdong Huang,Zicheng Xie,Wentao Tian,Jingyu Liu,Lunhong Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed framework for heart rate prediction that handles data heterogeneity through random feature dropout for source diversity and time-aware attention with contrastive learning for user differences, achieving 17-15% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world heart rate prediction faces data heterogeneity challenges from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets (source heterogeneity) and distinct physiological patterns across individuals/activities (user heterogeneity), which existing methods fail to address effectively.

Method: Framework with random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity (different device feature sets), time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits, and contrastive learning objective to build discriminative representations agnostic to both heterogeneity types.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines by 17% on new ParroTao benchmark dataset and 15% on public FitRec dataset. Learned representations show strong discriminative power and practical value in downstream applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses both source and user heterogeneity in heart rate prediction, demonstrating significant performance improvements and practical applicability for real-world health monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Health is a Mixture of Experts framework for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare that handles incomplete data modalities and achieves superior performance on clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world healthcare data often has varied or incomplete modalities, but existing approaches require complete data or manual selection strategies, limiting applicability in clinical settings with varying data availability.

Method: Proposes MoE-Health with specialized expert networks and dynamic gating mechanism that dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities.

Result: Achieves superior performance on MIMIC-IV dataset for in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction compared to existing multimodal fusion methods.

Conclusion: MoE-Health effectively integrates multimodal information with improved predictive performance and robustness, making it suitable for diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses QR decomposition with column pivoting to extract an orthonormal basis from pretrained weights, then learns only scalar coefficients for linear combinations, achieving superior performance with dramatically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA and its SVD variants require learning both update matrices directly, which can be computationally expensive and yield hard-to-interpret singular vectors. There's a need for more efficient and structured adaptation methods.

Method: Extract orthonormal basis from pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, then express LoRA update as linear combination of these basis vectors while training only the scalar coefficients.

Result: QR-LoRA matches or exceeds performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA across GLUE tasks with only 601 parameters - 1000x reduction vs full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA.

Conclusion: QR-LoRA provides a highly parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach that imposes clear structure on adaptation while maintaining or improving performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

TL;DR: FLIP is a transformer-based VAE with latent diffusion that generates fair and private tabular data without relying on specific downstream tasks, using Rényi differential privacy and latent space alignment for fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, AI Act) and fairness concerns in synthetic data generation for sensitive domains like healthcare, enabling risk-aware data sharing.

Method: Transformer-based variational autoencoder with latent diffusion, Rényi differential privacy constraints during training, RDP-compatible balanced sampling, and latent space fairness alignment using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA).

Result: FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Conclusion: FLIP offers a comprehensive solution for generating privacy-preserving and fair synthetic tabular data with broad applicability beyond fixed downstream tasks.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

*Arman Oganisian*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Paper addresses informative timing in sequential treatment studies, showing how g-methods can adjust for waiting times as time-varying confounders to avoid bias in causal effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemiological studies often ignore that treatment timing varies across subjects in ways that may inform subsequent treatments and outcomes, leading to biased causal effect estimates.

Method: Uses g-methods to analyze sequentially timed treatments, treating waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders. Demonstrates with synthetic examples and provides implementation guidance.

Result: Shows that ignoring informative timing leads to biased estimates, while g-methods adjusting for waiting times provide valid causal inference even with death or censoring between treatments.

Conclusion: Considering treatment timing is crucial for valid inference, and g-methods that adjust for waiting times as time-varying confounders can correct for informative timing bias.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of
a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings,
treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.
Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of
subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue
and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this
work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated
with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential
treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the
waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as
a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how
g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how
adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in
between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification
with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide
implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our
concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid
inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods
that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DePIN markets have grown rapidly to over $10B market cap but face risks from unregulated operations and AI agent misalignment with human values, requiring better analysis and governance frameworks.

Method: Developed EconAgentic framework with three focus areas: modeling DePIN market dynamics, evaluating stakeholder actions/economic impacts, and analyzing macroeconomic indicators. Simulated AI agent responses to token incentives and compared with human benchmarks.

Result: EconAgentic provides valuable insights into DePIN market efficiency, inclusion, and stability, demonstrating how AI agents invest in infrastructure and adapt to market conditions.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to both academic understanding and practical improvements in designing and governing decentralized, tokenized economies by aligning market outcomes with societal goals.

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both

Motivation: Address the growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language processing by evaluating quantum text generation models against traditional architectures.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing five models (Transformer baseline, QKSAN, QRWKV, QASA) across five diverse datasets using multiple metrics including perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency measures.

Result: Transformers maintain overall superiority with lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest BLEU-1 score (0.2895), but quantum models show competitive performance: QKSAN achieves BLEU-1 score of 0.2800 with zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired models demonstrate promising capabilities in specific text generation scenarios, particularly in avoiding repetition and maintaining vocabulary diversity, though traditional Transformers remain the overall best performers.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language

Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum

diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including

measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest

Motivation: Address complex quantum physics problems by automating quantum circuit design for enhanced quantum sensing and estimation tasks through AI-driven learning

Method: Integrates Deep Q-Network with quantum-based action selection using Ry gates to create superposition of possible actions, measuring circuits for probabilistic outcomes to generate optimal gate sequences

Result: Successfully generates optimal quantum sensor circuits with two qubits using Rx, Ry, and S gates, achieving QFI of 1 and enabling automated creation of squeezed entangled states

Conclusion: Demonstrates synergy between AI and quantum computation, showing intelligent agents can autonomously discover optimal quantum circuit designs for improved sensing applications

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits
(QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates
computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S
gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.
This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing quantum
circuits for specific tasks is crucial for enhancing performance and
efficiency. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly
growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology.
The field is expected to provide new opportunities, especially regarding high
sensitivity and precision. Entanglement is one of the key factors in achieving
high sensitivity and measurement precision [3]. This paper presents a novel
approach utilizing quantum machine learning techniques to optimize entanglement
distribution in quantum sensor circuits. By leveraging reinforcement learning
within a quantum environment, we aim to optimize the entanglement layout to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy, which are
key indicators of a quantum system's sensitivity and coherence, while
minimizing circuit depth and gate counts. Our implementation, based on Qiskit,
integrates noise models and error mitigation strategies to simulate realistic
quantum environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in
circuit performance and sensitivity, highlighting the potential of machine
learning in quantum circuit optimization by measuring high QFI and entropy in
the range of 0.84-1.0 with depth and gate count reduction by 20-86%.

*Laxmisha Ashok Attisara,Sathish Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: RL + tensor networks optimize 60-qubit quantum sensor circuits, achieving near-maximal QFI (~1), high entanglement entropy (0.8-1.0), and 90% depth/gate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual optimization becomes infeasible as qubit count increases; need scalable methods to optimize entanglement distribution for quantum sensor sensitivity and efficiency.

Method: Reinforcement learning integrated with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network simulation to restructure circuits, maximizing QFI and entanglement entropy while minimizing gate count/depth.

Result: Consistent improvements: QFI approaching 1, entanglement entropy 0.8-1.0 range, up to 90% reduction in circuit depth and gate count for 60-qubit circuits.

Conclusion: Combining quantum machine learning with tensor networks enables effective optimization of complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing
and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing
these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in
large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and
efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering
integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation
(MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits
with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt
tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS)
representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix
approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while
reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent
improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the
0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results
highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor
networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

### [182] [From Canonical to Complex: Benchmarking LLM Capabilities in Undergraduate Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21452)
*Anna Geißler,Luca-Sophie Bien,Friedrich Schöppler,Tobias Hertel*

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: Current LLMs fail to meet the 95% competence threshold for unsupervised thermodynamics tutoring, achieving only 82% accuracy with particular weaknesses in irreversible scenarios and visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate science education, specifically testing their consistent, principle-grounded reasoning capabilities in thermodynamics.

Method: Created UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics benchmark covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation, tested on leading 2025-era LLMs.

Result: No model exceeded 95% competence threshold (best achieved 82%). Text-only items performed better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Performance showed little correlation with prompt phrasing or syntactic complexity.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised thermodynamics tutoring due to significant gaps in handling irreversible scenarios and connecting visual features to thermodynamic concepts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

### [183] [Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21663)
*Ardavan Mehdizadeh,Peter Schindler*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Systematic benchmark reveals that training data composition, not architectural complexity, dominates cleavage energy prediction accuracy in universal machine learning interatomic potentials. Models trained on non-equilibrium configurations achieve high accuracy while equilibrium-only models show 5x higher errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MLIPs' success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation existed for cleavage energy prediction - a critical property for fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art universal MLIPs using a DFT database of 36,718 slab structures across elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. Evaluated diverse architectural paradigms across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations.

Result: Training data composition dominates performance: OMat24-trained models achieve <6% MAPE and 87% correct stable surface identification without explicit training. Equilibrium-only models show 5x higher errors, surface-adsorbate models fail catastrophically with 17x degradation. Simpler architectures with appropriate data match complex transformers' accuracy with 10-100x speedup.

Conclusion: The community should focus on strategic training data generation capturing relevant physical phenomena rather than architectural complexity, as data quality significantly outweighs model sophistication for cleavage energy prediction.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

*Abhijit Sinha,Hemant Kumar Kathania,Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SSL pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2 significantly improve children's speech recognition in zero-shot scenarios, with Layer 22 features achieving 51.64% relative WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with children's speech due to distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics, while SSL models have shown success with adult speech but need evaluation for children's speech.

Method: Analyzed layer-wise features from SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, WavLM) integrated into DNN-based ASR system using Kaldi. Tested zero-shot scenario with WSJCAM0 adult training data and PFSTAR children testing data.

Result: Wav2Vec2 Layer 22 achieved lowest WER of 5.15% (51.64% improvement over baseline 10.65%). Performance improved consistently with age, with significant gains even for younger children. Results generalized to CMU Kids dataset.

Conclusion: SSL pre-trained models, particularly Wav2Vec2, offer effective zero-shot solutions for children's speech recognition, with specific layers providing optimal performance across different age groups.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Zero-shot keyword spotting for children's speech using SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec) achieves state-of-the-art results, with Wav2Vec2 layer 22 performing best at 0.7003 MTWV score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children's speech has distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics that challenge traditional KWS systems, requiring specialized approaches that can work in zero-shot scenarios without child-specific training data.

Method: Layer-wise feature extraction from SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec) used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. Trained on adult speech (WSJCAM0) and tested on children's speech (PFSTAR) to demonstrate zero-shot capability.

Result: Achieved SOTA results with Wav2Vec2 layer 22 performing best: ATWV 0.691, MTWV 0.7003, PFA 0.0164, PMiss 0.0547 for 30 keywords. Effective across different age groups and robust against noise, significantly outperforming MFCC baseline.

Conclusion: SSL features significantly enhance zero-shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges of child speakers' distinct characteristics and demonstrating robustness across age groups and noise conditions.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

*Theresia Veronika Rampisela,Maria Maistro,Tuukka Ruotsalo,Falk Scholer,Christina Lioma*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, finding that recommendations highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between group fairness and individual fairness in recommender systems, as prior work used different evaluation measures for each type, preventing proper comparison.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types, running 8 experiments across 3 datasets to analyze the relationship between group and individual fairness.

Result: Experiments show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals, revealing a novel tension between these two fairness types.

Conclusion: This finding is valuable for recommender system practitioners aiming to improve fairness, as it demonstrates that optimizing for one type of fairness may negatively impact the other, requiring careful consideration in system design.

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the cold-user problem in recommender systems where new users have limited interaction history, while maintaining privacy by not using sensitive demographic data.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning (Double and Dueling Deep Q-Networks) with matrix factorization to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse feedback.

Result: Superior performance on large e-commerce dataset compared to traditional methods; Dueling DQN particularly reduces RMSE for cold users.

Conclusion: Provides an effective privacy-constrained solution for cold-user recommendation problems through advanced DQN variants integrated with matrix factorization.

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

### [188] [Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460)
*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Diff-MSIN framework for multi-modal CTR prediction that addresses modality fusion challenges through synergistic relationship capture and dynamic adaptive fusion, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTR prediction methods primarily use ID modality and fail to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences, while current multi-modal fusion methods cannot effectively disentangle commonalities/specificities or capture synergistic effects between modalities.

Method: Proposes Diff-MSIN framework with three modules: Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) for feature representation, Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) for extracting synergistic/common/special information, and Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) for capturing user preferences and reducing noise. Uses Knowledge Decoupling method to encourage feature distinctiveness.

Result: Extensive experiments on Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets show significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The Diff-MSIN framework effectively enhances multi-modal CTR prediction by addressing modality fusion challenges and demonstrates strong potential for improving multi-modal recommendation systems.

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

*Fabian Raisch,Max Langtry,Felix Koch,Ruchi Choudhary,Christoph Goebel,Benjamin Tischler*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper compares continual learning (CL) and transfer learning (TL) strategies for building thermal dynamics modeling, proposing a new CL method called Seasonal Memory Learning that outperforms existing approaches by 28-35% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of updating building thermal models over time as more operational data is collected and building dynamics change (e.g., after retrofits or occupancy changes), which current TL approaches don't adequately handle.

Method: Compared several CL and TL strategies plus training from scratch using 5-7 years of simulated data for single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and occupancy changes.

Result: Proposed Seasonal Memory Learning (SML) CL strategy provided 28.1% accuracy improvement without concept drifts and 34.9% improvement with concept drifts compared to initial fine-tuning benchmark, while maintaining low computational effort.

Conclusion: SML outperforms existing CL and TL methods for building thermal dynamics modeling, offering significant accuracy improvements while being computationally efficient, making it suitable for handling changing building dynamics over time.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

*Navid Aftabi,Abhishek Hanchate,Satish Bukkapatnam,Dan Li*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: DynaMark is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically adapts watermarking to detect replay attacks in industrial controllers, reducing energy consumption by 70% while maintaining detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industry 4.0 machine tool controllers are vulnerable to replay attacks using outdated sensor data, and current watermarking methods assume linear-Gaussian dynamics with constant statistics, making them ineffective for time-varying proprietary MTC behaviors.

Method: Models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP) using reinforcement learning to learn an adaptive policy online. Dynamically adjusts zero-mean Gaussian watermark covariance using measurements and detector feedback without requiring system knowledge. Includes Bayesian belief updating for real-time detection confidence.

Result: On Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin: 70% reduction in watermark energy while preserving nominal trajectory compared to constant variance baselines. Maintains average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. Physical stepper-motor testbed validation shows rapid alarm triggering with less control performance decline.

Conclusion: DynaMark provides an effective adaptive watermarking solution for industrial controllers that works without system knowledge, significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining detection performance, and outperforms existing benchmarks in real-world validation.

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates steering in mediator-augmented two-player games, showing limitations of information design alone and deriving payment requirements. It introduces a one-shot information design approach that improves convergence to target action profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide players toward specific action profiles in normal-form games through combined information and incentive design, addressing limitations of pure information design approaches.

Method: Characterizes games where steering is possible, establishes limitations of information design alone, derives payment requirements, and introduces a one-shot information design phase that transforms the interaction into a Stackelberg game.

Result: Shows steering to desired profiles isn't always achievable with information design alone or with sublinear payments. The proposed augmented approach improves convergence rate by a constant factor with high probability.

Conclusion: The one-shot information design approach before repeated games effectively addresses limitations of traditional information design, providing better steering capabilities and improved convergence rates to target action profiles.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

TL;DR: Novel binary weight multi-bit activation method for CNN accelerators that achieves better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing approaches


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIM accelerator approaches either sacrifice accuracy with binary quantization or lose efficiency with multi-bit quantization - need better balance

Method: Binary weight quantization with closed-form solutions per layer + differentiable multi-bit activation quantization function that avoids extensive search

Result: 1.44%-5.46% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10, 0.35%-5.37% on ImageNet; 4-bit activation optimal for hardware cost-performance balance

Conclusion: BWMA method successfully bridges accuracy-efficiency gap in CIM accelerators with binary weights and multi-bit activations

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.

Motivation: Unregistered surface meshes and raw 3D scans lack point-wise correspondences and contain noise, making automatic deformation computation challenging.

Result: Extensive evaluations show effectiveness and versatility on challenging tasks like walking and running with unregistered meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully handles motion prediction and transfer on noisy, unregistered body meshes without requiring rigging.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the
data. In this paper, we propose a new, rig-free, data-driven framework for
motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

### [194] [ARGS: Advanced Regularization on Aligning Gaussians over the Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21344)
*Jeong Uk Lee,Sung Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Improved 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction with two regularization strategies: effective rank regularization for better Gaussian shapes and neural SDF integration for surface coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS models like SuGaR still have room for improvement in visual fidelity and scene consistency, particularly with extreme anisotropic Gaussian shapes and surface alignment issues.

Method: Two complementary regularization strategies: 1) Effective rank regularization to discourage needle-like Gaussian shapes and favor disk-like forms, 2) Integration of neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) with Eikonal loss for continuous global surface prior and better geometry alignment.

Result: The model achieves more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data with improved fidelity of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization techniques successfully address limitations in both Gaussian shape optimization and overall surface coherence, leading to enhanced 3D mesh reconstruction quality from 3D Gaussian Splatting data.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Proposes NSPDI-SNN, a spiking neural network method inspired by biological dendrites that achieves high sparsity with minimal performance loss through nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNNs lack the complex dendritic structure found in biological neurons, which have efficient information processing capabilities. The study aims to incorporate dendritic properties to improve SNN efficiency.

Method: Introduces nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) for better spatiotemporal representation and heterogeneous state transition ratios. Implements nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) to achieve high sparsity while maintaining flexibility.

Result: Achieved best results on all three event stream datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, CIFAR10) and performed well on complex tasks like speech recognition and maze navigation. Maintained high sparsity with minimal performance degradation and improved synaptic information transfer efficiency.

Conclusion: The complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide an effective approach for developing efficient SNN methods that balance performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on
simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent
artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons
have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,
the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.
Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal
dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with
nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we
introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation
of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state
transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible
nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We
conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,
CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks
(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).
Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal
performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best
experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis
showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information
transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a
promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

*Kevin Putra Santoso,Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah,Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaveLLDM is a lightweight latent diffusion model that combines neural audio codec with latent diffusion for efficient audio restoration and denoising in compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while maintaining reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality audio is essential but degradation from noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains challenging. Traditional diffusion models require significant computational resources and struggle with longer missing segments.

Method: WaveLLDM integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion, processing audio in compressed latent space rather than time or spectral domain to reduce computational complexity while preserving quality.

Result: Achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low LSD scores (0.48-0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data, but underperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality (WB-PESQ: 1.62-1.71, STOI: 0.76-0.78).

Conclusion: While current performance has limitations due to suboptimal tuning and insufficient training, the flexible architecture combining neural codec and latent diffusion provides a strong foundation for future development in efficient audio restoration.

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

TL;DR: FFTP patching strategy preserves harmonic structure in spectrograms by spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, reducing patch count and computation by up to 83.26% while improving audio classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio models use square patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and creates excessive patches, slowing training and increasing computation.

Method: Proposes Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP) that matches time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms, and SpecMask augmentation that combines full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under fixed masking budget.

Result: Improves mAP by up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2 while reducing computation by up to 83.26%.

Conclusion: FFTP with SpecMask provides both performance gains and efficiency improvements for audio spectrogram modeling, better preserving harmonic structure while reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

TL;DR: A scalable vibration sensor system that uses synthesized acoustic data for pretraining and requires minimal labeled data for fine-tuning, enabling robust daily routine tracking for dementia patients living alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing remote monitoring solutions for dementia patients living alone, including privacy concerns, activity recognition challenges, and poor model generalizability to new environments.

Method: Uses structural vibration sensors to monitor human activities unobtrusively. Adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio for model pretraining, then fine-tunes with very limited labeled data from end users' homes.

Result: Creates a robust framework for daily routine tracking that requires substantially less labeled data compared to current solutions while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed scalable solution successfully addresses key limitations in remote monitoring for dementia care by leveraging synthesized data pretraining and minimal fine-tuning data, making it practical for real-world home deployment.

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRASP framework combines global statistics and local attentive pooling for better MOS prediction, achieving 10.39% improvement over average pooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pooling methods focus on either global or frame-level perspectives, missing complementary perceptual insights needed for accurate mean opinion score prediction.

Method: Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP) integrates coarse-grained global statistical summaries with fine-grained attentive analysis of perceptually significant segments.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval, AES-Natural), MOS prediction backbones (CLAP-based, AudioBox-Aesthetics), and audio generation systems with 10.39% relative improvement in SRCC.

Conclusion: DRASP provides more thorough and robust representations by capturing both structural context and local details, demonstrating strong generalization ability for MOS prediction tasks.

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

*Natalia L. Rubio,Eric F. Darve,Alison L. Marsden*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Machine learning-enhanced 0D hemodynamic model improves accuracy at vessel bifurcations while maintaining computational efficiency for cardiovascular flow simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D finite-element simulations are computationally expensive for clinical use, while standard reduced-order models lack accuracy at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics occur.

Method: Developed a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model using neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating non-dimensionalization and flow split prediction, integrated into 0D models via optimization-based solution.

Result: Substantial accuracy improvements: RRI method reduced inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) to 25 mmHg (17%) compared to standard 0D models, validated across Reynolds numbers 0-5,500 in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees.

Conclusion: The hybrid machine learning-numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling suitable for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ImmunoAI is a machine learning framework that accelerates antibody discovery by 89% using gradient-boosted models trained on structural and physicochemical features, enabling rapid response to viral outbreaks like hMPV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional antibody discovery takes 10-12 months, which is too slow for rapid outbreak response to viruses like human metapneumovirus that threaten vulnerable populations.

Method: Used LightGBM regressor trained on 213 antibody-antigen complexes with thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D topological descriptors. Fine-tuned on 117 SARS-CoV-2 pairs and used AlphaFold2 for hMPV structure prediction.

Result: Reduced search space by 89%, improved RMSE from 1.70 to 0.92, and identified two optimal antibodies with picomolar affinities targeting key hMPV mutation sites (G42V and E96K).

Conclusion: ImmunoAI significantly shortens antibody design cycles and enables faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

TL;DR: Review of automated methods for inferring digital twins from biological time series, comparing symbolic vs sparse regression approaches and highlighting emerging deep learning methods for biomedical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated approaches to create digital twins of biomedical systems from high-throughput data, moving beyond laborious manual data integration by human modelers.

Method: Systematic review and evaluation of methodologies (primarily symbolic and sparse regression) for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series data, assessed against eight biological and methodological challenges.

Result: Sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, especially when using Bayesian frameworks. Deep learning and large language models show promise for prior knowledge integration but need reliability improvements.

Conclusion: Progress will come from hybrid frameworks combining mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and deep learning capabilities, supported by a proposed benchmarking framework for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

TL;DR: Pep2Prob is a new dataset and benchmark for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction in mass spectrometry proteomics, showing that peptide-specific models outperform traditional global statistics approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MS^2 proteomics methods use oversimplified global fragmentation statistics that assume uniform fragment probabilities across all peptides, limiting prediction accuracy from a biochemical perspective.

Method: Created Pep2Prob dataset with fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors from 183M+ high-quality HCD MS^2 spectra. Established baselines using statistical rules and learning-based methods that leverage peptide-specific information.

Result: Models using peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous global statistics methods. Performance scaling with model capacity indicates complex nonlinear peptide-fragmentation relationships requiring sophisticated ML approaches.

Conclusion: Peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction is superior to global statistics, and the Pep2Prob dataset enables development of more accurate machine learning models for proteomics analysis.

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

Motivation: Database normalization is essential for data integrity but is time-consuming and error-prone when done manually by data engineers, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Uses a dual-model self-refinement architecture combining generation and verification modules. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on verification feedback until normalization requirements are met, using carefully designed zero-shot prompts for accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show Miffie can normalize complex database schemas while maintaining high accuracy, demonstrating effective automated normalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Miffie successfully automates database normalization using LLMs, providing an accurate and efficient solution that eliminates manual effort while preserving data integrity through its dual-model refinement approach.

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

*Logan S. McCarty*

TL;DR: QPMs are quantum-inspired probability metrics that overcome limitations of MMD in high-dimensional spaces by embedding distributions in quantum state space, providing better sensitivity to distributional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Maximum Mean Discrepancy struggle with high-dimensional and non-compact domains, creating a need for more robust probability distribution comparison tools.

Method: Embed probability measures in quantum state space (positive, unit-trace operators on Hilbert space), extending kernel-based methods and serving as integral probability metrics with enhanced approximation capabilities.

Result: QPMs offer improved sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions, can be calculated using eigenvalue methods, and work as effective drop-in replacements for MMD in generative modeling tasks.

Conclusion: This quantum-inspired approach provides a powerful foundation for analyzing and manipulating probability measures by combining quantum mechanics with classical probability theory.

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A generative modeling framework using random weighted support points that efficiently produces diverse, high-quality samples from datasets without neural networks or probabilistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and interpretable generative modeling alternative that doesn't require complex neural architectures or probabilistic modeling assumptions, while preserving data structure through representative support points.

Method: Uses random weighted support points inspired by Dirichlet process and Bayesian bootstrap weighting, with optimization via Convex-Concave Procedure (CCP) to generate diverse sample sets from fixed datasets.

Result: Produces high-quality, diverse outputs on MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets at significantly lower computational cost compared to GANs and DDPMs, with genuinely interpolative samples that preserve data structure.

Conclusion: Random weighted support points provide a principled, scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling that is computationally efficient and preserves underlying data characteristics.

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the learning of copula random number generators by addressing bandwidth selection in maximum mean discrepancy for generative moment matching networks, overcoming limitations of fixed-kernel approaches.

Method: Introduces adaptive bandwidth selection procedure based on relative error of training loss, increasing kernel count during training, and uses validation loss relative error for early stopping in AGMMNs.

Result: AGMMNs show significantly improved training performance over GMMNs with similar training time, demonstrated through validation MMD trajectories, samples, and values across high-dimensional applications up to dimension 100.

Conclusion: AGMMNs outperform both standard GMMNs and traditional parametric copula models in convergence rates, financial applications, and model prediction, providing superior copula generation capabilities.

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

*Nazanin Siavash,Armin Moin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes using LLMs with RAG pipelines for model-to-code transformations in quantum software systems, showing that well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by 4x for generating Qiskit code from UML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costs and mitigate risks in quantum/hybrid quantum-classical software development by leveraging model-driven approaches to address the heterogeneous platform landscape and developer skill gaps.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with LLMs, incorporating sample Qiskit code from GitHub repositories to generate Python code from UML model instances of quantum software systems.

Result: Experimental results show well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and consistent quantum code generation.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for quantum code generation and suggests future research directions including using software system models as RAG sources and applying LLMs for code-to-code transformations like transpilation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

*Dongjun Lee,Changho Hwang,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UTRL is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to generate high-quality unit tests by adversarial training of test and code generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating unit test generation with LLMs is challenging, and existing methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests are underexplored.

Method: Adversarial reinforcement learning framework with two LLMs: a unit test generator trained to maximize discrimination reward (exposing faults) and a code generator trained to maximize code reward (passing tests).

Result: UTRL-trained Qwen3-4B generates higher quality unit tests than supervised fine-tuning and outperforms GPT-4.1, producing tests that more closely align with ground-truth evaluations.

Conclusion: UTRL is an effective framework for training LLMs to generate high-quality unit tests through adversarial reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

### [211] [The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433)
*Tobias Lindenbauer,Igor Slinko,Ludwig Felder,Egor Bogomolov,Yaroslav Zharov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Simple observation-masking strategy outperforms complex LLM summarization in SWE-agent context management, achieving similar solve rates at half the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents generate long, expensive context histories during complex problem-solving. While current SE agents use LLM summarization to manage context, it's unclear if this complexity provides real benefits over simpler approaches.

Method: Systematic comparison of context management strategies in SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five model configurations, testing raw agent vs. LLM summarization vs. simple observation-masking.

Result: Observation-masking halves cost compared to raw agent while matching or slightly exceeding summarization's solve rate. With Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improved solve rate from 53.8% to 54.8% while remaining cost-effective.

Conclusion: For SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the simplest context management approach (observation-masking) is both most effective and efficient, challenging the need for complex LLM summarization techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep active learning with Bayesian Neural Network approximation and weighted loss reduces labeled data needs for COVID-19 lung severity classification from chest X-rays while handling class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of requiring large amounts of labeled data for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays, particularly under class imbalance conditions, and to reduce the labeling burden while maintaining diagnostic performance.

Method: Used deep active learning with Bayesian Neural Network approximation (Monte Carlo Dropout) and weighted loss function. Applied various acquisition functions to iteratively select the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Trained on 2,319 CXRs from COVID-19 patients labeled by radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe.

Result: Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC 0.91) in binary classification using only 15.4% of training data. Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC 0.86) in multi-class classification using 23.1% of labeled data. Outperformed more complex acquisition functions and significantly reduced labeling requirements.

Conclusion: Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance and maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance for COVID-19 lung severity classification.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes Sequential Matched Filter (SMF) using Reinforcement Learning to design adaptive filter sequences for better signal detection in low SNR conditions, particularly for ear-ECG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional matched filters perform poorly with low signal-to-noise ratio signals like those from edge devices, where noise patterns can resemble target signals within limited filter lengths.

Method: Replaces single matched filter with a sequence of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent, formulating filter design as a sequential decision-making process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets.

Conclusion: SMF framework provides reliable and interpretable clinical decision support and can be extended to various applications requiring accurate pattern localization from noise-corrupted signals.

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic CV dataset to address the lack of diverse datasets for researching bias in algorithmic hiring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic hiring systems can introduce bias and discrimination, but existing research lacks diverse CV datasets to properly study, measure, and mitigate these fairness issues.

Method: The authors developed an approach to build a synthetic dataset of 1,730 CVs with features modeled on real materials collected through a data donation campaign.

Result: A dataset of 1,730 synthetic CVs was created that reflects diverse candidate backgrounds, serving as a benchmarking standard for algorithmic hiring discrimination research.

Conclusion: This synthetic CV dataset addresses a critical gap in fairness research for algorithmic hiring and provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating and comparing bias mitigation techniques.

Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.

*Weihuan Deng,Yaofu Huang,Luan Chen,Xun Li,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Proposed a drone imagery and MLLM-based framework for assessing rural livability across China, revealing a dual-core spatial pattern and identifying government spending as the key determinant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rural livability assessment methods face scalability issues with questionnaires and poor suitability of urban-oriented visual methods for rural contexts, necessitating a specialized framework.

Method: Used drone imagery of 1,766 villages across China, developed an efficient image comparison mechanism with binary search interpolation, and constructed chain-of-thought prompting based on expert knowledge for comprehensive assessment.

Result: Identified a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern radiating from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces, with government fiscal expenditure as the core determinant (3.9-4.9 unit livability increase per unit spending increase).

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable and scalable rural livability assessment, offering valuable insights for rural construction policy-making with government spending as the primary leverage point.

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop transparent and replicable techniques for understanding and controlling the reasoning processes behind LLM-generated economic forecasts, enabling researchers to study and correct biases in AI-generated economic predictions.

Method: The approach involves 'brain scanning' large language models to identify plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, then steering these concepts while holding other factors constant to analyze their relative importance and manipulate model behavior.

Result: The method successfully maps LLM economic forecasts to specific concepts (sentiment, technical analysis, timing), computes their relative importance, and enables steering models to be more/less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic without reducing performance.

Conclusion: This transparent, lightweight, and replicable approach provides valuable tools for empirical social science research by allowing systematic analysis and correction of biases in LLM-generated economic forecasts through concept-level manipulation.

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan"
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as
sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative
importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,
lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.

TL;DR: QuadKAN uses spline-parameterized KANs with proprioception-vision fusion for robust quadruped locomotion, achieving better performance than SOTA methods with improved efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-guided quadruped motion control requires robust integration of proprioception and vision inputs to handle diverse terrains and obstacles effectively.

Method: Proposed QuadKAN framework with spline-parameterized cross-modal policy using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, spline encoder for proprioception, spline fusion head for multi-modal inputs, trained with MMDR and PPO.

Result: Achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions across diverse terrains (even/uneven surfaces, static/dynamic obstacles) compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: Spline-parameterized policies provide a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion with improved sample efficiency and reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made

Motivation: Current vision-language-action models fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction, despite progress in general robot control.

Method: Developed unified architecture processing multimodal inputs indiscriminately, trained on EO-Data1.5M (1.5M samples) using auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in open-world understanding and generalization across long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks on multiple embodiments.

Conclusion: EO-1 offers valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models through interleaved vision-text-action learning.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for

Result: 3D CNN showed promising results compared to RNNs, with performance assessed through task completion success, lap-time metrics, and driving consistency. Architectural modifications and track complexity influenced generalization and control performance.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D CNN approach demonstrates effectiveness for mini autonomous car driving in simulated environments, offering a valuable methodology for autonomous driving algorithm development and evaluation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

### [221] [Multi-robot Path Planning and Scheduling via Model Predictive Optimal Transport (MPC-OT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21205)
*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel multi-robot path planning method using optimal transport theory and model predictive control to ensure non-overlapping trajectories and efficient navigation in obstacle-filled environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches that map robots to targets first and then plan paths can result in overlapping paths leading to deadlocks, especially when N robots need to navigate to M targets in shared space with obstacles.

Method: Discretize space into K cells with K×K cost structure, use optimal transport theory to provide optimal non-overlapping cell transitions, and integrate temporal structure with replans and model predictive control for dynamic constraints.

Result: The method guarantees non-overlapping trajectories while providing minimum cost paths, with computational complexity of O(K³logK) worst-case and O(K²logK) for well-behaved problems.

Conclusion: Optimal transport theory combined with model predictive control offers an effective framework for multi-robot navigation that prevents deadlocks and handles dynamic constraints through strategic replanning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

*Chenduo Ying,Linkang Du,Peng Cheng,Yuanchao Shu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector identifies and characterizes unreliability in LLM-generated policy code for robotic manipulation, analyzing task complexity and instruction granularity, and provides a refinement approach that improves reliability by up to 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' capabilities in reasoning and code generation for robotic manipulation, achieving reliable policy code remains challenging due to diverse real-world task requirements and varying user instructions that can cause unreliability.

Method: Designed RoboInspector pipeline to analyze unreliability from task complexity and instruction granularity perspectives. Conducted comprehensive experiments with 168 combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs across two frameworks. Identified four main unreliable behaviors and introduced a refinement approach using failure policy code feedback.

Result: Identified four main unreliable behaviors leading to manipulation failure. The refinement approach improved reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: RoboInspector successfully characterizes unreliability in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation and provides practical insights for development. The feedback-guided refinement approach significantly enhances reliability, offering valuable contributions to making LLM-based robotic systems more robust.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Brazilian children use conversational agents for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment. Structured scaffolds (conversation-tree recipes) significantly improve interaction quality compared to unstructured approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Brazilian children interact with conversational agents and develop structured scaffolds to enhance these interactions for educational and developmental purposes.

Method: Two studies: Study 1 used interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis with 23 participants over 7 weeks; Study 2 used GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges to compare structured-prompting recipes vs unstructured baseline.

Result: Identified three CA functions (School, Discovery, Entertainment), developed recipe scaffolds mirroring parent-child support, and quantitative evaluation showed gains in readability, question metrics, and coherence with structured approach.

Conclusion: Scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles, and caregiver-curated content are recommended. Contributions include first CWA application with Brazilian children, empirical framework of child-CA information flows, and effective LLM-scaffolding recipes.

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

*Yi-Hao Peng,Dingzeyu Li,Jeffrey P. Bigham,Amy Pavel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae is a UI agent that identifies decision points during web tasks and pauses to let blind/low-vision users make choices, improving user agency and preference matching compared to end-to-end agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI agents perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices or providing contextual information, reducing user agency for blind and low-vision users.

Method: Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, automatically identifying decision points during task execution and pausing to prompt users for clarification.

Result: In a study with BLV participants on real-world web tasks, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences compared to baseline agents including OpenAI Operator.

Conclusion: Morae exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach where users benefit from UI automation while maintaining the ability to express preferences, addressing the agency problem in current UI agents.

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: Study of 20 AI-based computer perception tool developers reveals 4 key design priorities for clinical integration: context/explainability, workflow alignment, stakeholder customization, and innovation balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers balance clinical utility with user acceptability when integrating AI-based computer perception tools into clinical workflows.

Method: 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools, transcribed and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

Result: Identified 4 key design priorities: 1) context awareness and explainability, 2) workflow alignment, 3) stakeholder customization, 4) innovation within established paradigms. Developers see themselves as both technical architects and ethical stewards.

Conclusion: Successful clinical integration requires documenting customization choices, defining customization limits, transparent output communication, and user training through interdisciplinary collaboration between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

*Malte Lüken,Javier Garcia-Bernardo,Sreeparna Deb,Flavio Hafner,Megha Khosla*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Using Dutch administrative data to create population-scale network embeddings from shared social contexts, then analyzing their predictive power for right-wing populist voting and making the embeddings interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage administrative registry data to construct population-scale networks and use machine learning embeddings to capture individuals' network positions, then assess their informativeness for predicting political voting behavior.

Method: Created embeddings for all Dutch persons from a network representing five shared contexts (neighborhood, work, family, household, school), used them to predict right-wing populist voting, and transformed embeddings for interpretability.

Result: Embeddings alone predicted voting above chance but worse than individual characteristics. After transformation, one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome, revealing network structure differences related to education levels and school ties.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how to make population-scale network embeddings interpretable and links structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting, contributing both methodologically and substantively.

Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale
networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With
machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations
-- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the
network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a
population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood,
work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these
embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings
alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed
worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings
with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However,
after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and
orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with
the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed
differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between
different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes
methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can
be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network
differences in education to right-wing populist voting.

*Til Spreuer,Josef Hoppe,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A novel matrix-factorization-based heuristic for lifting graph edge-flow signals to cell complexes to achieve sparse representations using Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors, offering computational efficiency improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find sparse, interpretable representations of observed edge-flow signals on graphs by lifting them to cell complexes, addressing the NP-hard nature of the general problem with a more efficient solution.

Method: Developed a matrix-factorization-based heuristic that augments graphs with 2-cells (polygons) to create cell complexes where Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors provide sparse representations of edge flows.

Result: The approach is significantly less computationally expensive than prior heuristics, with only marginally worse performance in most settings, and outperforms previous methods in noisy environments for both solution quality and speed.

Conclusion: The proposed matrix-factorization-based heuristic provides an efficient and effective solution for the graph lifting problem, particularly excelling in noisy settings where it surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

### [229] [Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302)
*Jie Zhu,Chihao Shen,Ziyang Li,Jiahao Yu,Yizheng Chen,Kexin Pei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Locus is a directed fuzzing framework that synthesizes semantic predicates as intermediate milestones to guide fuzzing towards target states, achieving 41.6x average speedup over state-of-the-art fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed fuzzing faces challenges in reaching deeply nested target states due to large search spaces. Existing approaches using branch distances or manual constraints are insufficient and difficult to generalize across diverse programs and target states.

Method: Locus uses an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine semantic predicates that capture meaningful intermediate states. These predicates serve as milestones, reject unlikely executions, and provide coverage guidance, while symbolic execution ensures predicates strictly relax target states to prevent false rejections.

Result: Locus substantially improves efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers with 41.6x average speedup. It discovered eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.

Conclusion: The Locus framework successfully addresses directed fuzzing challenges by automating predicate synthesis for semantic intermediate states, demonstrating significant performance improvements and real-world vulnerability discovery capabilities.

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target
program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,
confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential
vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are
often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by
numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches
rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;
however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize
progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified
constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to
generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed
fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing
progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones
towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under
fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while
providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to
diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis
tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while
ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false
rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus
substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in
discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.
So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already
acknowledged with a draft patch.

TL;DR: zkLoRA is the first framework that combines LoRA fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs to provide secure and verifiable LLM fine-tuning while protecting model and data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is computationally demanding and raises security/privacy concerns in untrusted environments. Existing parameter-efficient methods like LoRA lack security guarantees under zero-knowledge constraints.

Method: Uses advanced cryptographic techniques (lookup arguments, sumcheck protocols, polynomial commitments) to verify both arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer architectures. Provides end-to-end verifiability for forward/backward propagation and parameter updates.

Result: Successfully implemented and validated on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to 13 billion parameters. Demonstrates practicality and efficiency through GPU-based implementations.

Conclusion: zkLoRA bridges the gap between parameter-efficient fine-tuning and security, enabling trustworthy LLM deployment in sensitive environments by combining LoRA with zero-knowledge proofs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to
specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns
about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although
parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly
reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of
fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.
To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA
fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and
correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup
arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.
The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,
backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while
safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging
GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency
through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to
13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs,
zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of
LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

*Daryna Oliynyk,Rudolf Mayer,Kathrin Grosse,Andreas Rauber*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper provides the first standardized methodology for evaluating model stealing attacks against ML models, focusing on image classification but applicable to other domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model stealing attacks threaten ML model confidentiality, but current research lacks standardized evaluation methods, making it difficult to compare attacks and assess progress in the field.

Method: The authors study image classification model stealing attacks, propose a comprehensive threat model, develop a framework for attack comparison, analyze existing attack setups, and derive best practices for attack development and evaluation.

Result: The paper establishes the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks, including recommendations for design, evaluation, and an extensive list of open research questions.

Conclusion: This work provides standardized evaluation practices that transfer across problem domains, addressing the critical gap in model stealing attack research methodology.

Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning
models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious
party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute
model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are
continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised,
making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field.
This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for
designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the
largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those
attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive
threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse
attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been
studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack
development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list
of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks.
Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence
establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing
attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OptMark is an optimization-based multi-bit watermarking method for diffusion-generated images that embeds robust watermarks in intermediate latents using structural and detail components with adjoint gradient methods for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion watermarking methods have limitations - zero-bit systems lack capacity for large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are sensitive to image transformations and generative attacks, lacking comprehensive robustness.

Method: Embeds multi-bit watermark into intermediate latents of diffusion denoising process using optimization-based approach. Uses structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and detail watermark late to withstand transformations. Incorporates adjoint gradient methods to reduce memory usage from O(N) to O(1).

Result: Achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking with robust resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations, editing, and regeneration attacks.

Conclusion: OptMark provides an effective solution for robust multi-bit watermarking in diffusion-generated images, addressing both capacity limitations of zero-bit systems and robustness issues of existing multi-bit methods while maintaining memory efficiency.

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection
and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face
significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for
large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to
certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of
comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an
optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the
intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically
inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail
watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization
terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the
challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising
steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,
reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that
OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust
resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,
editing, and regeneration attacks.

However, existing methods rely on static drafting\nlengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across\nvarying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an\ninformation-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on\nconfidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based\nuncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed\nmethod dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each\niteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves\nresource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the\nverification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling\nmore flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation\nquality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate\nsignificant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or\nimproving BLEU and ROUGE scores.

The quality of tongue surface segmentation\nsignificantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and\nsubsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing\nresearch on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a\nlack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a\ntongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation\nmethod, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while\nreducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by\n96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an\nimpressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged\nand deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool\n(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers\nto use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on\nTCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher\nclassification performance and better interpretability than original tongue\nimages.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion.

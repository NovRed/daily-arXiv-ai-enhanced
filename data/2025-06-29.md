### [1] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTSurv is a novel MIL framework using optimal transport to model pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, improving survival prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity in WSIs, both globally and locally.

Method: OTSurv formulates survival prediction as an OT problem with global long-tail and local uncertainty-aware constraints, solved via an unbalanced OT formulation.

Result: OTSurv achieves a 3.6% improvement in average C-index and statistical significance in log-rank tests across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: OTSurv is a powerful, interpretable tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [2] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoDiff combines stereo matching for static regions and video depth diffusion for dynamic areas to improve video depth estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth estimation differs from image depth estimation due to varying temporal consistency needs in static and dynamic regions.

Method: StereoDiff uses a two-stage approach: stereo matching for static areas and video depth diffusion for dynamic regions, leveraging their complementary strengths.

Result: StereoDiff achieves superior consistency and accuracy in zero-shot, real-world benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The synergy of stereo matching and video depth diffusion in StereoDiff effectively addresses the unique challenges of video depth estimation.

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [3] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConViTac is a visual-tactile representation learning network using contrastive embeddings for better feature fusion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.0%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance alignment of visual-tactile features during fusion, addressing poor integration in previous direct combination methods.

Method: Uses Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) with self-supervised contrastive learning and cross-modal attention for unified latent embeddings.

Result: Improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks.

Conclusion: ConViTac effectively aligns visual-tactile features, enhancing performance in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

### [4] [AI-Driven MRI-based Brain Tumour Segmentation Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20786)
*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates promptable models (SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D) and nnU-Net on medical image segmentation, comparing their performance with varying prompt qualities. SAM and SAM 2 outperform nnU-Net with precise prompts, but nnU-Net remains dominant due to impractical prompt requirements. Fine-tuning improves point prompt performance but not beyond bounding boxes or nnU-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation and comparison of promptable models in medical image segmentation across diverse prompt qualities on a common dataset.

Method: Zero-shot inference and fine-tuning of SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net on BraTS 2023 datasets using points and bounding box prompts.

Result: SAM and SAM 2 achieve high Dice scores (0.894, 0.893) with accurate prompts, surpassing nnU-Net. Fine-tuning improves point prompts but not beyond bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

Conclusion: nnU-Net remains the top choice for medical segmentation due to impractical prompt needs, though promptable models show promise with precise inputs.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [5] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA, Gemini Flash 2.0, and HD-GCN. HD-GCN performs best, but V-JEPA shows promise for reducing system complexity. Gemini struggles with zero-shot gesture recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generalization abilities of VFMs and VLMs for simplifying gesture recognition systems in noisy environments like agile production.

Method: Comparison of V-JEPA (VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (VLM), and HD-GCN (skeleton-based) on the NUGGET dataset for gesture recognition.

Result: HD-GCN achieves the best performance, while V-JEPA comes close with a simple classification head. Gemini struggles in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: VFMs like V-JEPA offer potential for reducing system complexity, but further research is needed for VLMs like Gemini to improve gesture recognition.

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [6] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using vision-language models (VLMs) to select the most trustworthy super-resolution (SR) image from diffusion-generated sets, validated by a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in SR solutions by balancing fidelity and perceptual quality, ensuring semantic correctness and reliability for critical applications.

Method: Leverages VLMs (e.g., BLIP-2, GPT-4o) to assess SR samples via structured queries, then ensembles top candidates. Introduces TWS, a hybrid metric combining semantic similarity, structural integrity, and artifact sensitivity.

Result: TWS correlates strongly with human preference, and VLM-guided selections achieve high TWS values, outperforming conventional metrics like PSNR and LPIPS.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, generalizable solution for trustworthy SR, aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [7] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixCLR introduces a method for semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) by adapting contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization, improving performance when combined with other semi-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underperformance of domain generalization methods due to label scarcity and lack of explicit domain invariance regularization.

Method: Adapts contrastive learning with class information from pseudo-labels and a repelling term for domain invariance.

Result: FixCLR is effective, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods, and shows improvements in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FixCLR is a promising SSDG method, enhancing domain generalization with explicit invariance regularization.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [8] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COVER introduces vector contrastive learning for pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining, addressing over-dispersion in standard CL and improving medical vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard contrastive learning disrupts pixel-wise feature correlation in medical vision due to over-dispersion.

Method: COVER reformulates CL as vector regression, using displacement vectors for dispersion quantification and a vector pyramid for granularity adaptation.

Result: COVER significantly improves pixel-wise SSP across 8 tasks in 2D and 4 modalities.

Conclusion: COVER advances generalizable medical visual foundation models by preserving pixel-wise feature correlations.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

### [9] [Enhancing Ambiguous Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with Soft Label-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20867)
*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAS is a data augmentation method for dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) that uses soft labels to handle ambiguous expressions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recognition of ambiguous facial expressions in real-world data is crucial for practical DFER applications.

Method: MIDAS combines pairs of video frames and their soft labels (probabilities of multiple emotions) to augment training data, extending mixup to video data.

Result: Experiments on DFEW and FERV39k-Plus show MIDAS-trained models outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MIDAS is a simple, effective solution for improving DFER performance on ambiguous expressions.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [10] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThirdEye introduces a cue-aware pipeline for monocular depth estimation, leveraging explicit visual cues like occlusion boundaries and shading, fused hierarchically with a working-memory module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods implicitly learn depth from RGB pixels, missing explicit cues humans use. ThirdEye aims to incorporate these cues deliberately.

Method: Uses pre-trained, frozen networks to supply cues, fused in a cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) with a working-memory module. An adaptive-bins transformer head produces disparity maps.

Result: ThirdEye inherits external supervision from frozen cue experts, requiring minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach combines neuroscientific insights with deep learning, promising improved depth estimation by leveraging explicit cues.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

*Shubhankar Borse,Seokeon Choi,Sunghyun Park,Jeongho Kim,Shreya Kadambi,Risheek Garrepalli,Sungrack Yun,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiHuman-Testbench, a benchmark for evaluating generative models in multi-human image generation, addressing challenges like identity preservation and action complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a dedicated benchmark for multi-human image generation, especially for complex actions and identity preservation, motivates the creation of MultiHuman-Testbench.

Method: The benchmark includes 1800 samples with diverse text prompts and 5,550 unique human face images, along with pose conditioning images. It employs four metrics for evaluation and proposes novel techniques like human segmentation and Hungarian matching for improved ID similarity.

Result: The benchmark evaluates diverse models, including zero-shot and training-based methods, showing significant improvements in ID similarity and action alignment.

Conclusion: MultiHuman-Testbench provides a standardized tool and insights to advance research in multi-human image generation.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

*Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Davi Geiger,Luiz Velho,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores geometric foundations of stereo vision, proposing new constraints for depth reconstruction and evaluating deep learning-based stereo matching and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depth reconstruction in stereo vision by integrating geometric priors and human-inspired perception.

Method: Revisits the Cyclopean Eye model, introduces novel geometric constraints, and evaluates deep learning-based stereo matching and attention mechanisms.

Result: Combining geometric priors with learned features enhances understanding and performance of stereo vision systems.

Conclusion: Integrating strong geometric constraints with learned features improves stereo vision depth reconstruction.

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

### [13] [FaSTA$^*$: Fast-Slow Toolpath Agent with Subroutine Mining for Efficient Multi-turn Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20911)
*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic agent, FaSTA$^*$, combines LLM planning with A$^*$ search for cost-efficient multi-turn image editing, reusing subroutines to save costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of cost-efficient multi-turn image editing by combining fast LLM planning with accurate local A$^*$ search.

Method: Uses LLMs for high-level subtask planning and A$^*$ for local search, reusing successful subroutines to reduce exploration costs.

Result: FaSTA$^*$ is more computationally efficient than baselines while maintaining competitive success rates.

Conclusion: FaSTA$^*$ effectively balances speed and accuracy for complex image editing tasks.

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

### [14] [M2SFormer: Multi-Spectral and Multi-Scale Attention with Edge-Aware Difficulty Guidance for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20922)
*Ju-Hyeon Nam,Dong-Hyun Moon,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2SFormer is a Transformer-based framework for image forgery localization, unifying multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions to improve accuracy and preserve fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for forgery localization struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, especially for subtle or complex tampering.

Method: M2SFormer integrates multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in skip connections and uses a global prior map to guide a difficulty-guided attention module for preserving fine details.

Result: M2SFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in detecting and localizing forgeries, showing superior generalization across unseen domains.

Conclusion: The proposed M2SFormer effectively addresses challenges in forgery localization, offering improved accuracy and detail preservation.

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

*Hao Zhang,Haolan Xu,Chun Feng,Varun Jampani,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysRig is a physics-based skinning and rigging framework that overcomes LBS limitations by simulating deformable soft-body structures, ensuring realistic and differentiable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) causes artifacts and fails to model elastic materials, motivating the need for a physics-based alternative.

Method: PhysRig embeds a rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation, simulated as a soft-body structure using continuum mechanics and Eulerian grids. Material prototypes reduce learning complexity.

Result: Outperforms LBS, generating realistic deformations and excelling in pose transfer tasks.

Conclusion: PhysRig offers a versatile, physics-based solution for articulated object modeling, addressing LBS shortcomings.

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of diverse, large-scale datasets for aviation visibility estimation in ML research.

Method: Collected a year-long dataset from FAA weather cameras and tested three ML approaches on it and other public datasets.

Result: Provided a benchmark comparing ML methods to an ASTM standard, demonstrating feasibility.

Conclusion: The new dataset and benchmark support ML-based aviation visibility estimation as a viable alternative to traditional sensors.

Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for
providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors;
however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available
datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation,
of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are
absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of
a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera
network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying
three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and
tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when
compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

*Dejie Yang,Zhu Xu,Xinjie Gao,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HST-CSLR proposes a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree to better align visual and textual modalities in continuous sign language recognition, leveraging gloss knowledge and reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large datasets and precise annotations in CSLR limits performance. Cross-modal solutions often underutilize gloss knowledge.

Method: Constructs a Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST) to align visual and textual modalities step-by-step, using gloss-specific knowledge from large language models and contrastive alignment enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, Sign Language Gesture).

Conclusion: HST-CSLR efficiently combines gloss knowledge with visual representation learning, improving CSLR performance.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

TL;DR: PathChat+ is a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) for pathology, trained on extensive pathology-specific data, outperforming prior models. SlideSeek, an AI system using PathChat+, autonomously analyzes whole-slide images with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs in computational pathology lack integration of natural language, multi-image understanding, and autonomous diagnostic reasoning.

Method: Developed PathChat+ with 1M+ pathology-specific instruction samples and 5.5M Q&A turns. SlideSeek uses PathChat+ for hierarchical reasoning on WSIs.

Result: PathChat+ outperforms prior models and general-purpose SOTA models. SlideSeek achieves high accuracy on DDxBench and generates interpretable reports.

Conclusion: PathChat+ and SlideSeek address key limitations in computational pathology, advancing AI-driven diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,
humanly-interpretable summary reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFVEdit is an efficient zero-shot video editing method for Video DiTs, eliminating attention modification and fine-tuning, offering significant speed-up and memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods for Video DiTs incur high computational costs due to attention modification or fine-tuning.

Method: DFVEdit operates on clean latents via flow transformation, unifying editing and sampling under a continuous flow perspective. It introduces Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) and integrates Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) and Embedding Reinforcement (ER).

Result: DFVEdit achieves 20x inference speed-up, 85% memory reduction, and state-of-the-art performance in structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.

Conclusion: DFVEdit is a highly efficient and effective solution for video editing in Video DiTs, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

### [21] [From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20977)
*Tao Liu,Dafeng Zhang,Gengchen Li,Shizhuo Liu,Yongqi Song,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Boqian Li,Kai Wang,Yaxing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cradle2Cane is a two-pass face aging framework using T2I diffusion models to balance age accuracy and identity preservation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face aging methods struggle with realistic transformations across large age gaps or extreme poses, often sacrificing identity for age accuracy or vice versa.

Method: Proposes a two-pass framework: first pass uses adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) for age accuracy; second pass enhances identity preservation with identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb).

Result: Outperforms existing methods on CelebA-HQ, achieving better age accuracy and identity consistency.

Conclusion: Cradle2Cane effectively addresses the Age-ID trade-off, offering a robust solution for realistic face aging.

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

### [22] [3D Scene-Camera Representation with Joint Camera Photometric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20979)
*Weichen Dai,Kangcheng Ma,Jiaxin Wang,Kecen Pan,Yuhang Ming,Hua Zhang,Wanzeng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene-camera representation method with joint photometric optimization improves 3D scene quality by separating scene-unrelated distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric distortions in camera imaging degrade 3D scene representation quality by introducing erroneous, scene-unrelated information.

Method: Proposes a full photometric model with internal and external components, optimizes camera parameters, and uses depth regularization to avoid fitting distortions.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D scene representations despite imaging degradation like vignetting and dirt.

Conclusion: The method effectively separates scene-unrelated distortions, enhancing 3D scene representation accuracy.

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

### [23] [Rethink Sparse Signals for Pose-guided Text-to-image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20983)
*Wenjie Xuan,Jing Zhang,Juhua Liu,Bo Du,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SP-Ctrl, a method using sparse signals (like OpenPose) for pose-guided text-to-image generation, addressing challenges of dense signals. It enhances sparse signals with learnable spatial representations and keypoint concept learning, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose) pose editing difficulties and inconsistencies with text prompts, motivating a revisit to sparse signals for their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature.

Method: SP-Ctrl extends OpenPose to learnable spatial representations and introduces keypoint concept learning to improve pose alignment.

Result: SP-Ctrl outperforms recent methods under sparse-pose guidance and matches dense signal-based performance, showing promise in diverse and cross-species generation.

Conclusion: Sparse signals, enhanced by SP-Ctrl, are a viable alternative to dense signals for pose-guided image generation, offering simplicity and robust controllability.

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

TL;DR: EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework, improves CZSL by addressing suboptimal primitive feature derivation and cross-modal matching, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods inadequately handle distinct semantic subsets and compositional divergence, limiting fine-grained alignment.

Method: Proposes domain-expert adaption for token-aware learning and semantic variant alignment for accurate image-primitives matching.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks in closed- and open-world settings.

Conclusion: EVA effectively addresses limitations in CZSL, demonstrating superior compositional generalization.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D VLMs underperform in point-level tasks like segmentation due to lack of direct 3D-text alignment, limiting local feature-text linking.

Method: Proposes TSDASeg with a direct cross-modal alignment module and memory banks for storing and dynamically updating text, visual, and cross-modal features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: TSDASeg effectively addresses inconsistencies in interactive segmentation by aligning 3D and textual/2D data and leveraging memory for dynamic updates.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: To comprehensively capture all sound events in a video by sequentially generating audio tracks, inspired by traditional Foley workflows and compositional generation frameworks.

Method: A step-by-step approach where each audio track is generated conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated tracks, using pre-trained models without specialized datasets.

Result: Generates multiple distinct audio tracks per video, achieving higher-quality composite audio than existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively synthesizes high-quality composite audio by leveraging guided generation and accessible training data.

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific

aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,

design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos due to reliance on high-resolution images or static assumptions.

Method: Uses sparse-controlled Gaussian splatting to generate dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry from blurry videos.

Result: Achieves robust performance in novel view synthesis for dynamic blurry scenes, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: DBMovi-GS effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges like poor annotations, long-tailed data, and inconsistent staining styles in cytopathology for robust abnormal cell detection.

Method: SAIC selects candidates from an abnormal cell bank, uses high-frequency feature reconstruction for style-aligned composition, and filters images with a vision-language model.

Result: SAIC-synthesized images boost detection performance and robustness, especially for tail categories and styles, validated by quality evaluations.

Conclusion: SAIC is practical for clinical use, improving detection models, with code available for public access.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionGuard improves helmet violation detection in traffic surveillance by addressing environmental and data challenges with a multi-stage framework, boosting mAP by 3.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing road safety through reliable helmet violation detection despite environmental and data inconsistencies.

Method: VisionGuard combines Adaptive Labeling (tracking-based refinement) and Contextual Expander (virtual bounding boxes for underrepresented classes).

Result: 3.1% improvement in mAP over baseline detectors.

Conclusion: VisionGuard is effective for real-world traffic surveillance, promoting safety and compliance.

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework combining SAM and FFCL improves accuracy and speed in assessing breast cancer tumor margins during surgery, reducing re-excision rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D specimen radiography (SR) lacks accuracy, leading to high re-excision rates. Improved margin assessment is needed to enhance surgical outcomes.

Method: Combines Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL) for patch-level classification and refined tumor margin segmentation.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity, with inference time of 47ms per image.

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM enhances intraoperative margin assessment, potentially reducing re-excision rates and improving breast cancer treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Aging Multiverse framework generates diverse facial aging trajectories from a single image, conditioned on external factors, using a training-free diffusion-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods model aging as a single deterministic path, lacking diversity and control over external factors like environment and lifestyle.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion-based approach with attention mixing and Simulated Aging Regularization for balanced identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control.

Result: Outperforms existing models in identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, validated by experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework transforms aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable process, enabling applications in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to simplify AR-based novel view synthesis by using locally reconstructed light fields and error visualization, reducing user effort and improving results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR methods for novel view synthesis are mentally demanding and restrict capture areas due to 3D annotations and sampling limitations.

Method: The approach uses locally reconstructed light fields and visualizes errors to guide users in inserting new views, avoiding 3D annotations.

Result: The method reduces user effort, minimizes disappointment in results, and works well with fewer view samples. It also aids radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed error-peaking visualization is less invasive and effective for mobile view synthesis and larger scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

### [35] [Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011)
*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline to enhance video quality assessment (VQA) by generating descriptive linguistic outputs instead of numerical scores, addressing scalability and effectiveness issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA methods rely on numerical scores, which lack descriptive power for complex quality dimensions. The paper aims to leverage video large multimodal models (LMMs) via instruction tuning to provide richer quality descriptions.

Method: The SIG pipeline scores unlabeled videos across multiple quality dimensions, maps scores to text-defined levels, and uses hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model correlations between dimensions and overall quality. It generates the Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset with 320K instruction-response pairs and employs a progressive tuning strategy for video LMMs.

Result: The method improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs, as demonstrated on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SIG pipeline and S2I dataset effectively enhance video LMMs' ability to assess and justify video quality, offering a scalable and automated alternative to traditional VQA methods.

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

*Huan Wang,Haoran Li,Huaming Chen,Jun Yan,Jiahua Shi,Jun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedSC addresses data heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging semantic-aware collaboration through relational and consistent prototypes, improving model performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning leads to biased labeling preferences, which existing methods often overlook by neglecting intra-client semantic information.

Method: FedSC constructs relational and consistent prototypes at a semantic level, using inter-contrastive learning and discrepancy aggregation to optimize local models.

Result: Experiments show FedSC's effectiveness in handling data heterogeneity and improving convergence, with theoretical guarantees provided.

Conclusion: FedSC successfully tackles data heterogeneity by utilizing semantic-aware collaboration, offering a robust solution for federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

*Qingyue Jiao,Kangyu Zheng,Yiyu Shi,Zhiding Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel classical-quantum GAN for generating color medical images outperforms classical and hybrid models with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in skin disease datasets (class imbalance, privacy, bias) and computational inefficiencies of classical generative models.

Method: Uses a classical-quantum latent space fusion technique to create a hybrid GAN for generating high-quality color medical images.

Result: Outperforms classical and hybrid GANs in image quality and classification boost, with 25x fewer parameters and 10x fewer epochs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates quantum image generation's potential, validated on real quantum hardware, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

*Fuyan Ma,Yiran He,Bin Sun,Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA-FER improves facial expression recognition by aligning multimodal prompts with fine-grained textual-visual relationships, leveraging LLM-generated descriptions and prototype-guided alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based FER methods fail to capture subtle textual-visual relationships, limiting their ability to distinguish fine-grained facial expressions.

Method: MPA-FER uses LLM-generated hard prompts, aligns soft prompts with hard prompts, and employs prototype-guided visual feature alignment and cross-modal global-local alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmarks while maintaining pretrained model benefits and low computational costs.

Conclusion: MPA-FER effectively enhances FER by integrating fine-grained semantic guidance and preserving model generalization.

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet) is proposed for efficient multimodal object detection, reducing computational costs while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational overhead and complexity of existing multimodal feature fusion methods in object detection.

Method: Introduces LASFNet with an attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module and a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM).

Result: Achieves a 90% reduction in parameters, 85% lower computational cost, and 1%-3% higher mAP compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LASFNet offers a simpler, more efficient solution for multimodal object detection with improved performance.

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be
open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 1D binary image latents for compact image representation, achieving competitive performance in text-to-image models with fewer tokens and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational demands and improve efficiency in high-resolution image modeling by advancing compact discrete image representation.

Method: Proposes 1D binary image latents, replacing traditional one-hot codebook tokens with binary vectors, enabling fewer tokens and preserving details.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with 128 tokens for 1024x1024 images, 32x fewer tokens than VQ-VAEs, and faster training/inference.

Conclusion: The 1D binary latent space offers a scalable, efficient alternative to conventional tokenization, with no need for private data or refinements.

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Motivation: Commercial RGB-D cameras produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects, and traditional methods struggle due to limited training data diversity.

Method: DidSee integrates a rescaled noise scheduler, noise-agnostic single-step training, and a semantic enhancer for joint depth completion and segmentation.

Result: DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, robust real-world generalization, and improves downstream tasks like pose estimation and robotic grasping.

Conclusion: DidSee effectively addresses biases and feature limitations in depth completion for non-Lambertian objects, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using diffusion models to improve domain generalization and adaptation in detectors, reducing inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source and target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors often underperform due to domain gaps between training and testing data. Existing methods using diffusion models struggle with high inference costs and underutilize their capabilities.

Method: Extracts intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, uses box-masked images with class prompts for robust feature extraction, and applies consistency loss to align auxiliary and ordinary branches.

Result: Achieves competitive results on 3 DA and 5 DG benchmarks, with significant efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the superiority of diffusion models in domain-generalized and adaptive detection tasks, offering insights for cross-domain visual perception.

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

TL;DR: FGS improves faithfulness in text-guided diffusion models for image editing without compromising editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between editability and faithfulness in image editing using diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS) to enhance faithfulness and resolve misalignment with editability.

Result: FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability and works with diverse editing methods.

Conclusion: FGS enables precise, high-quality image edits by balancing faithfulness and editability effectively.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve adversarial transferability by leveraging self-supervised ViT features, inspired by their synergy with Transformers.

Method: Proposes dSVA, a generative framework combining CL and MIM features, using a generator and attention mechanisms for adversarial example creation.

Result: CL and MIM features, when exploited together, significantly boost adversarial generalizability, achieving superior black-box transferability.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViT features (CL and MIM) enhance adversarial transferability, with dSVA outperforming existing methods across diverse architectures.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document analysis solutions lack flexibility for user-customized applications, prompting the need for a more adaptable approach.

Method: The RoI-Matcher framework uses siamese networks for multi-level feature extraction and cross-attention layers for semantic alignment between reference and target documents.

Result: The method proves effective on the RoI-Matching-Bench, serving as a baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the limitations of fixed-category document analysis by introducing a flexible, efficient, and open-set RoI-Matching task and framework.

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

*Dinh-Khoi Vo,Van-Loc Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMURAI combines CLIP-based semantic matching and shape-guided re-ranking for 3D object retrieval from masked 2D images and language descriptions, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in retrieving 3D objects from limited 2D masked images and natural language descriptions, complicated by distorted viewpoints, ambiguous prompts, and noisy masks.

Method: SAMURAI integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking using binary silhouettes and a majority voting strategy, plus a preprocessing pipeline for mask enhancement.

Result: The framework achieves competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set.

Conclusion: Combining shape priors with language understanding is crucial for robust 3D object retrieval in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

*Hongyu Yan,Kunming Luo,Weiyu Li,Yixun Liang,Shengming Li,Jingwei Huang,Chunchao Guo,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMaster is an end-to-end framework for 3D character generation, unifying pose transformation and 3D reconstruction to address distortions and improve control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D character modeling suffer from distortions due to self-occlusion and viewpoints, affecting reconstruction quality.

Method: PoseMaster integrates pose transformation and 3D generation, uses 3D body bones for pose control, and employs random condition masking during training.

Result: PoseMaster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in A-pose character generation and achieves precise arbitrary-pose control.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses distortion issues and enhances 3D character modeling efficiency and quality.

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of modern perception models hinder real-world deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: EgoAdapt uses cross-modal distillation and adaptive policy learning for efficient inference across tasks like action recognition and behavior anticipation.

Result: Achieves up to 89.09% reduction in GMACs, 82.02% in parameters, and 9.6x energy savings while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: EgoAdapt offers a scalable solution for efficient egocentric perception, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory
egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with
substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for
real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal
distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different
egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active
speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is
adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable.
Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens,
EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly
enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%,
and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the
performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.

*Mahmoud Tahmasebi,Saif Huq,Kevin Meehan,Marion McAfee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) for real-time, accurate stereo matching by mitigating information loss in small-scale cost volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High accuracy and real-time performance in stereo matching are challenging due to trade-offs between large-scale cost volumes (accurate but slow) and small-scale ones (fast but less accurate).

Method: ESM integrates primary features into disparity upsampling, extracts and fuses features, and refines them via a compact hourglass network.

Result: Achieves 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on AGX Orin, with high disparity map accuracy.

Conclusion: ESM balances accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time autonomous systems.

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

TL;DR: OracleFusion, a two-stage framework, uses MLLM with SAR and OSVF to decipher Oracle Bone Script, improving semantics, visuals, and glyph integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The undeciphered Oracle Bone Script characters pose challenges due to their complexity; OracleFusion aims to aid experts in interpretation.

Method: Stage 1: MLLM with SAR analyzes glyph structure. Stage 2: OSVF ensures accurate, semantically enriched vector font generation.

Result: OracleFusion outperforms baselines in semantics, visuals, and glyph maintenance, aiding decipherment.

Conclusion: OracleFusion is a valuable tool for deciphering Oracle Bone Script, offering expert-like insights.

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

*Luosheng Xu,Dalin Zhang,Zhaohui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlickCD is a lightweight model for remote sensing change detection, balancing high accuracy with low resource use, outperforming complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of complex deep learning models in change detection by proposing a resource-efficient solution suitable for on-satellite processing.

Method: Uses an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to highlight critical feature differences and Local-Global Fusion Blocks with SWSA and EGSA for multi-scale semantic capture.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance or minor accuracy loss (<1% F1) while reducing computational and storage costs significantly.

Conclusion: FlickCD offers a practical, efficient alternative for change detection, ideal for resource-constrained environments like satellites.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal reasoning models, proposing a method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with context, format, accuracy, and logical rewards to enhance global context understanding and avoid shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal reasoning by addressing insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems in existing models.

Method: Uses RL with rewards (context, format, accuracy, logical) judged by a large language model (LLM) to ensure thorough reasoning and multimodal integration. Introduces IntentBench for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates advanced performance on omni-modal benchmarks compared to other models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by leveraging RL and LLM-based rewards, validated by superior benchmark performance.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

TL;DR: VideoLLMs struggle with multi-shot scenarios. A new dataset (MultiClip-Bench) and model (IPFormer-VideoLLM) are introduced to address this, improving multi-shot understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs fail in multi-shot scenarios due to lack of annotated datasets, leading to issues like identity forgetting and key frame negligence.

Method: Introduces MultiClip-Bench dataset with dense descriptions and QA pairs for multi-shot scenarios. Proposes IPFormer-VideoLLM, which injects instance-level features via an attention-based connector.

Result: Training with MultiClip-Bench boosts multi-shot performance. IPFormer-VideoLLM enhances understanding and performs well across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The new dataset and model significantly improve multi-shot video understanding and generalize well to other benchmarks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient updates of 3D scene representations are essential for robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI, but existing methods often require re-optimizing entire scenes, leading to high computational costs.

Method: CL-Splats uses a change-detection module to segment updated and static scene components, allowing localized optimization. It also supports storing and recovering previous scene states.

Result: Experiments show CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with better reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CL-Splats provides a robust foundation for real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction, with potential for future applications in temporal segmentation and scene analysis.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Motivation: Addressing uncertainty and multimodality in trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, moving beyond supervised learning limitations.

Method: GoIRL integrates vectorized context representations, a feature adaptor for lane-graph aggregation, and a hierarchical trajectory generator with refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse & nuScenes benchmarks with superior generalization.

Conclusion: GoIRL offers a robust, data-efficient alternative to supervised methods for trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior
generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack coverage for extremely dark scenes (0.0001 lux), limiting the exploration of learning-based methods in such conditions.

Method: A paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline creates the SIED dataset. A diffusion-based framework with an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and color consistency loss is proposed for enhancement.

Result: The method effectively restores visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, validated on SIED and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SIED dataset and proposed framework advance low-light RAW image enhancement, especially in extremely dark conditions.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks

Motivation: Addressing challenges like redundant features, limited detail sensitivity, and weak robustness in multiscale defect detection.

Method: Uses a BiFPN-style architecture, Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM), and attention-based fusion strategies (AC and CAF).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across diverse defect types and scales.

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA is a robust solution for industrial surface defect detection, improving performance and detail sensitivity.

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces tree-based semantic loss functions for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation, improving performance on sparsely annotated datasets and enabling OOD detection without affecting ID segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning methods for biomedical segmentation penalize errors uniformly, ignoring inter-class semantics in the label space.

Method: Two tree-based semantic loss functions are introduced, leveraging hierarchical label organization, and integrated into a sparse annotation training approach.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on a 107-class HSI dataset with clinically-defined semantic tree structure, plus effective OOD detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances segmentation and OOD detection, demonstrating the value of hierarchical label semantics in HSI tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

### [61] [Geometry and Perception Guided Gaussians for Multiview-consistent 3D Generation from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21152)
*Pufan Li,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method integrates geometry and perception priors to generate detailed 3D objects from single-view images, improving multiview consistency and geometric detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D object generation from single-view images lack multiview consistency and geometric detail, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The method trains three Gaussian branches (geometry prior, perception prior, Gaussian noise) and refines them through mutual interaction and reprojection-based depth consistency.

Result: The approach achieves higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions, outperforming existing methods in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines geometry and perception priors for robust and consistent 3D object generation from single images.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

### [62] [HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546)
*Xinzhuo Li,Adheesh Juvekar,Xingyou Liu,Muntasir Wahed,Kiet A. Nguyen,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalluSegBench is introduced as the first benchmark to evaluate hallucinations in vision-language segmentation, using counterfactual visual reasoning and a novel dataset of 1340 instance pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination lack focus on visual context manipulation, limiting their ability to diagnose critical failures.

Method: The benchmark includes a dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs across 281 object classes and introduces new metrics to quantify hallucination sensitivity under visual edits.

Result: Experiments show vision-driven hallucinations are more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning is essential for diagnosing grounding fidelity in vision-language segmentation models.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

### [63] [Topology-Aware Modeling for Unsupervised Simulation-to-Reality Point Cloud Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21165)
*Longkun Zou,Kangjun Liu,Ke Chen,Kailing Guo,Kui Jia,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework to address the Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud classification, leveraging global topology and self-supervised learning for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Sim2Real domain gap in 3D point cloud data limits classifier generalization, as current UDA methods lack robust, domain-insensitive descriptors.

Method: Proposes TAM, which uses global spatial topology and self-supervised learning to model topological relations, along with a cross-domain contrastive self-training strategy.

Result: TAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three Sim2Real benchmarks, demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: The TAM framework effectively mitigates the Sim2Real gap, enhancing point cloud classification performance.

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

*Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Peitian Zhang,Kun Lun,Huaying Yuan,Juenjie Zhou,Shitao Xiao,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-X^2L introduces bi-level KV compression and selective KV re-loading for efficient long-video understanding in MLLMs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost and information loss in long-video understanding (LVU) for multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: Uses bi-level KV compression (L-KVs and H-KVs) and selective KV re-loading to balance detail preservation and computational efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing KV-compression methods on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench while saving computation cost.

Conclusion: Video-X^2L is a simple, effective, and training-free solution for efficient LVU in MLLMs.

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

*Yuheng Zhang,Mengfei Duan,Kunyu Peng,Yuhang Wang,Ruiping Liu,Fei Teng,Kai Luo,Zhiyong Li,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction (OccOoD) to detect anomalies in 3D voxel space, addressing limitations of existing methods. It proposes synthetic datasets (VAA-KITTI, VAA-KITTI-360) and a novel framework (OccOoD) with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF), achieving state-of-the-art OoD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction struggle with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, leading to safety risks in autonomous driving.

Method: The paper proposes a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline to create datasets (VAA-KITTI, VAA-KITTI-360) and introduces OccOoD, a framework with VBPF for OoD detection via geometry-semantic fusion.

Result: OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection (AuROC: 67.34%, AuPRCr: 29.21%) while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance.

Conclusion: The work advances OoD detection in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, with publicly available datasets and code.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D
semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF)
leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art
OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m
region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The
established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at

### [66] [GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188)
*Zijun Lin,Shuting He,Cheston Tan,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GroundFlow, a plug-in module for temporal reasoning in 3D point cloud sequential grounding (SG3D), improving accuracy over baseline methods by 7.5% and 10.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods fail to extract temporal information from multi-step text instructions, especially with pronouns like "it" or "here," limiting their effectiveness in SG3D tasks.

Method: GroundFlow selectively extracts short-term and long-term step information, integrating it into 3DVG models for better temporal reasoning.

Result: GroundFlow boosts baseline accuracy significantly (+7.5% and +10.2%) and outperforms a pre-trained 3D large language model in the SG3D benchmark.

Conclusion: GroundFlow enhances temporal reasoning in 3DVG models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SG3D across five datasets.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

*Yihong Cao,Jiaming Zhang,Xu Zheng,Hao Shi,Kunyu Peng,Hang Liu,Kailun Yang,Hui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UNLOCK, a source-free method for panoramic image segmentation, addressing occlusion and distortion challenges without relying on labeled source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic image processing is hindered by distortions, occlusions, and limited annotations. Existing methods require source data, which is impractical.

Method: UNLOCK uses Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning to adapt without source data or target labels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (10.9 mAAP, 11.6 mAP) and +4.3 mAPQ improvement over source-only methods.

Conclusion: UNLOCK provides a practical, source-free solution for panoramic segmentation, matching source-dependent methods' performance.

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the
source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: MedPrompt is a unified framework combining LLMs for task planning and modular CNNs for image processing, enabling scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging with high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image analysis systems are task-specific and inflexible, requiring separate models for different tasks. MedPrompt aims to unify these workflows.

Method: Uses a few-shot prompted LLM (Llama-4-17B) for task planning and modular CNN (DeepFusionLab) for image processing. Task-specific weights are dynamically routed without retraining the entire system.

Result: Achieves 97% correctness in prompt execution, 2.5s average latency, and high accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 for segmentation, F1 0.9744 for classification).

Conclusion: MedPrompt successfully combines LLM interpretability with CNN efficiency, offering scalable and flexible medical image analysis.

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

*Louis Kerner,Michel Meintz,Bihe Zhao,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BitMark is a bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity text-to-image models to prevent model collapse by embedding detectable watermarks in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of model collapse due to reuse of generated content as training data motivates the need for watermarking to identify and mitigate degradation.

Method: BitMark embeds watermarks at the bit level of token streams across multiple resolutions during image generation, preserving visual fidelity and robustness.

Result: BitMark ensures watermark detectability even after reuse in training other models, exhibiting high radioactivity.

Conclusion: BitMark offers a reliable solution to prevent model collapse by enabling detection of generated outputs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

TL;DR: A training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) method improves performance by focusing on high-quality reference data, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVS methods rely on pre-trained models or synthetic data, but their performance is limited by model capabilities or poor reference data quality.

Method: Proposes a data-quality-oriented framework with a pipeline for high-quality reference sets and a simple similarity-based retrieval method.

Result: Outperforms all existing training-free OVS methods on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

TL;DR: DiMPLe disentangles invariant and spurious features in multi-modal learning, improving OOD performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations in visual data hinder OOD performance; DiMPLe addresses this by disentangling features across modalities.

Method: Combines mutual information minimization, spurious feature regularization, and contrastive learning on invariant features.

Result: Outperforms CoOp-OOD with 15.27% gain in base class accuracy and 44.31% in novel class accuracy across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: DiMPLe effectively disentangles features, enhancing robustness and generalization in multi-modal learning.

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in

*Xianghan Meng,Zhengyu Tong,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering (TR²C) for Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), outperforming existing subspace clustering methods by learning structured representations and affinity for video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subspace clustering methods assume high-dimensional temporal data follows a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution, but this may not hold for complex human motions in cluttered backgrounds.

Method: TR²C jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment frame sequences, ensuring temporally consistent and UoS-aligned representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets show state-of-the-art performance with various feature extractors.

Conclusion: TR²C effectively addresses the limitations of subspace clustering for HMS, achieving superior segmentation results.

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuIOD and DuET, a framework for dual incremental object detection, addressing both class and domain shifts without exemplars, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection systems need to handle new classes and changing environments, but existing methods (CIOD and DIOD) fail to address both simultaneously.

Method: Proposes DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework with Directional Consistency Loss to mitigate sign conflicts, enabling stable incremental learning.

Result: DuET achieves significant improvements (+13.12% and +11.39% RAI) on Pascal and Diverse Weather Series, with high Avg RI retention (89.3% and 88.57%).

Conclusion: DuET is a detector-agnostic solution for real-time incremental object detection, effectively balancing retention and adaptability.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

*Cheng Zou,Senlin Cheng,Bolei Xu,Dandan Zheng,Xiaobo Li,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTI proposes a video virtual try-on method by framing it as a conditional video inpainting task, using a Diffusion Transformer with 3D attention for better consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with spatial-temporal consistency in video try-on, and naive image-based approaches fail due to inconsistency.

Method: ViTI uses a Diffusion Transformer with 3D spatial-temporal attention, masking strategies, and multi-stage training for garment inpainting.

Result: ViTI outperforms previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: ViTI effectively addresses inconsistency in video try-on by treating it as a video inpainting task.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

*Wenda Shi,Yiren Song,Zihan Rao,Dengming Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Xingxing Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework and WordCon, a hybrid PEFT method, to improve word-level typography control in generated images, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise word-level typography control in generated images is challenging, and existing methods lack efficiency and controllability.

Method: The TIA framework uses cross-modal correspondence, while WordCon reparameterizes key parameters for efficiency. Masked and joint-attention losses enhance controllability.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative results show the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and method effectively address word-level typography control, with datasets and code made available for academic use.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

### [77] [HieraSurg: Hierarchy-Aware Diffusion Model for Surgical Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21287)
*Diego Biagini,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraSurg is a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework using two diffusion models to ensure consistency with surgical actions and phases, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical video generation lacks consistency with surgical actions and phases, needing better surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance.

Method: HieraSurg uses two diffusion models: one predicts coarse-grained semantic changes, and the other generates the final video by integrating these with fine-grained visual features.

Result: HieraSurg outperforms prior methods in Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation, showing strong generalization and higher frame-rate video generation.

Conclusion: HieraSurg demonstrates potential for practical surgical applications, especially when provided with existing segmentation maps.

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

*Lars Möllenbrok,Behnood Rasti,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoSMAE, a continual self-supervised learning method using masked autoencoders, combining data and model mixup to reduce catastrophic forgetting in remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the high cost and impracticality of gathering labeled training samples in remote sensing for continual learning.

Method: Uses data mixup (interpolating images) and model mixup knowledge distillation (interpolating model weights) to regularize learning.

Result: Achieves up to 4.94% improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods.

Conclusion: CoSMAE effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances generalization in continual learning for remote sensing.

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: The structured, alignment-based approach outperforms current VLMs in precise localization, paving the way for robust, interpretable document understanding systems.

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

*Dewen Zhang,Tahir Hussain,Wangpeng An,Hayaru Shouno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for human-centric tasks by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features, creating a specialized dataset. The fine-tuned model, LLaVA-Pose, shows a 33.2% improvement on the E-HPAUB benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform in human pose and action tasks due to a lack of specialized data.

Method: The method generates a dataset (200,328 samples) combining human keypoints, captions, and bounding boxes, focusing on conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The LLaVA-1.5-7B model is fine-tuned using this dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned LLaVA-Pose model achieves a 33.2% improvement over the original model on the E-HPAUB benchmark.

Conclusion: Keypoint-integrated data significantly enhances VLMs for human-centric visual understanding.

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for
human-centric visual understanding. Code is available at

*Haoyang Wu,Tsun-Hsuan Wang,Mathias Lechner,Ramin Hasani,Jennifer A. Eckhoff,Paul Pak,Ozanan R. Meireles,Guy Rosman,Yutong Ban,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical state space model for efficient surgical workflow analysis in long robot-assisted surgeries, outperforming transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long surgical videos challenge existing transformer models due to quadratic attention costs, requiring a scalable solution.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical state space model with local and global modules, trained via hybrid discrete-continuous supervision.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods (+2.8% to +12.9% across datasets).

Conclusion: The model efficiently processes full-length videos, capturing both local and global dynamics, with superior performance.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available
after paper acceptance.

*Lojze Zust,Yohann Cabon,Juliette Marrie,Leonid Antsfeld,Boris Chidlovskii,Jerome Revaud,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanSt3R proposes a unified approach for 3D panoptic segmentation, eliminating test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view segmentation in a single forward pass, achieving faster and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on 2D panoptic segmentation and require costly test-time optimization, missing spatial relationships across views. PanSt3R aims to address these limitations.

Method: PanSt3R builds on MUSt3R for 3D reconstruction, adding semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation. It introduces a principled mask merging method and novel-view prediction.

Result: PanSt3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and is significantly faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: PanSt3R is a simple, fast, and scalable solution for 3D panoptic segmentation, outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

### [83] [Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21349)
*Yizhe Cheng,Chunxun Tian,Haoru Wang,Wentao Zhu,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-driven framework for solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP), improving generalization and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches like Img-Interiors lack generalization and fail under sparse transmitter setups, prompting a physics-informed reformulation.

Method: The framework decouples the problem into two stages: a current estimator and a permittivity solver, leveraging induced current as an intermediate representation.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, generalization, and robustness, especially under sparse transmitter conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on EISP, advancing practical electromagnetic imaging solutions.

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

*Jacopo Dapueto,Nicoletta Noceti,Francesca Odone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic data to learn disentangled representations for real images, proposing a new metric and showing transferability is possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled Representation Learning struggles with real images due to correlated factors and lack of ground truth labels. Synthetic data offers a solution.

Method: Leverages synthetic data, studies fine-tuning effects, and proposes an interpretable intervention-based metric for factor encoding quality.

Result: Some disentanglement can transfer from synthetic to real data, proving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can aid disentangled representation learning for real images, with transferability demonstrated.

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

TL;DR: ShotBench is a benchmark for cinematic language understanding, revealing VLMs' limitations. ShotQA and ShotVL are introduced to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack proficiency in understanding nuanced cinematic grammar, limiting AI-assisted video generation.

Method: Developed ShotBench (3.5k QA pairs) and ShotQA (70k QA pairs), then fine-tuned ShotVL using supervised learning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Top VLM scored <60% accuracy on ShotBench; ShotVL outperformed all models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ShotBench and ShotQA advance cinematic understanding; ShotVL sets new benchmarks, with open-sourced resources to foster progress.

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene graph datasets lack precision and exhaustive annotations, limiting scene understanding and downstream applications.

Method: Developed CoPa-SG, a synthetic dataset with precise ground truth and exhaustive relations, introducing parametric (fine-grained) and proto-relations (hypothetical).

Result: Evaluated scene graph generation models using CoPa-SG and demonstrated enhanced planning and reasoning with new relation types.

Conclusion: CoPa-SG and its novel relation types improve scene graph representation and downstream applications like planning and reasoning.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on expensive setups, limiting accessibility for large-scale 3D annotation.

Method: Uses 10 user clicks per vehicle, formulates geometric constraints as an optimization problem, and incorporates probabilistic priors.

Result: Validated against KITTI and Cityscapes3D, achieving accurate 8-9 DoF cuboid placements.

Conclusion: ToosiCubix provides a practical and scalable alternative for high-quality 3D annotation.

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two modules (CAA and GOS) to improve image-to-point cloud registration by addressing feature channel attention mismatches and redundant correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds degrade matching results, and similar scene structures cause redundant correspondences.

Method: Introduces Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) to enhance intra-modal features and suppress cross-modal sensitivity, and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS) for global optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed modules effectively improve registration accuracy by addressing feature mismatches and redundancy.

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

TL;DR: FastRef is a prototype refinement framework for few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) that iteratively transfers query features to prototypes and suppresses anomalies via optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-IAD methods lack systematic incorporation of query image statistics to enhance prototype representativeness.

Method: FastRef uses a two-stage process: characteristic transfer via linear reconstruction and anomaly suppression via prototype alignment using optimal transport.

Result: FastRef improves performance across four benchmark datasets (MVTec, ViSA, MPDD, RealIAD) under 1/2/4-shots, showing effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: FastRef addresses the limitations of existing FS-IAD methods by refining prototypes with query statistics and anomaly suppression, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

### [91] [Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401)
*Zhirui Gao. Renjiao Yi,Yaqiao Dai,Xuening Zhu,Wei Chen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-stage framework for 3D parametric curve reconstruction from multi-view edge maps, using a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism (CurveGaussian) and adaptive topology optimization, outperforming two-stage methods in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods for 3D curve reconstruction suffer from error accumulation due to disconnected stages. A one-stage approach is needed to optimize curves directly from 2D edge maps.

Method: Proposes CurveGaussian, a curve-aware Gaussian representation enabling differentiable rendering, and a dynamic topology optimization framework for refining curves.

Result: Superior performance on ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks, with cleaner reconstructions and reduced parameter count.

Conclusion: The one-stage method is more efficient and robust, offering direct optimization of parametric curves for better 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XVerse enables precise, independent control in multi-subject text-to-image generation, improving editability and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like artifacts and attribute entanglement in Diffusion Transformers for multi-subject generation.

Method: Transforms reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, preserving image latents/features.

Result: High-fidelity, editable multi-subject synthesis with robust control over individual attributes.

Conclusion: XVerse advances personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

*Taoyu Wu,Yiyi Miao,Zhuoxiao Li,Haocheng Zhao,Kang Dang,Jionglong Su,Limin Yu,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces optical flow loss and depth regularization to improve 3DGS-based SLAM in endoscopic scenarios, addressing photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion. Enhanced 3DGS refinement further boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in endoscopic 3D reconstruction include photometric inconsistencies and dynamic motion, which degrade SLAM performance.

Method: Introduces optical flow loss as a geometric constraint and depth regularization. Enhances 3DGS refinement by focusing on keyframes with poor rendering quality.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation on static and dynamic surgical datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses endoscopic challenges, improving 3D reconstruction and rendering in surgical scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: HyperSORT is a framework using a hyper-network to predict UNet parameters from latent vectors, addressing biases in medical imaging datasets by learning a distribution of parameters for robust segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets often contain biases that degrade deep segmentation performance, but identifying these biases is challenging.

Method: HyperSORT uses a hyper-network to predict UNet parameters from latent vectors representing image and annotation variability, jointly learning hyper-network parameters and latent vectors.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real datasets, HyperSORT maps dataset biases, identifies errors, and clusters latent space for task-specific segmentation.

Conclusion: HyperSORT effectively structures datasets to identify biases and improve segmentation robustness, with code and analysis publicly available.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks deep learning approaches for classifying atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in breast cancer, introducing new datasets and achieving high accuracy with LoRA-based adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitoses are prognostically relevant but hard to identify due to low prevalence, subtle differences, and dataset imbalances.

Method: The study compares deep learning models (baseline, foundation models with linear probing, and LoRA fine-tuning) using the AMi-Br dataset and introduces new datasets (AtNorM-Br, AtNorM-MD).

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy up to 0.8135 (AMi-Br), 0.7696 (AtNorM-Br), and 0.7705 (AtNorM-MD), with LoRA-based adaptation performing best.

Conclusion: Atypical mitosis classification is feasible with transfer learning and fine-tuning, and the study provides open-source code and data.

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

*Mohamed Omran,Dimitris Kalatzis,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian,Auke Wiggers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for precise object placement in images using visual maps and coarse masks, ensuring high quality and flexibility without altering the background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-conditioned generative models struggle with precise object placement, requiring complex inpainting masks or prompts.

Method: Uses a visual map and coarse object masks as conditioning signals, built on an inpainting model to preserve the background.

Result: Effective in automotive settings, achieving accurate pose, location, and shape changes while maintaining edit quality.

Conclusion: Combines fine location and appearance control for precise object placement, outperforming joint object-background modeling methods.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a thermal imaging dataset for miner detection in underground mining emergencies, evaluating state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to establish baseline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground mining safety challenges necessitate reliable miner detection for robot-assisted search and rescue, but existing datasets are inadequate.

Method: A novel thermal imaging dataset was created by capturing mining activities, and several object detection algorithms (YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, RT-DETR) were evaluated.

Result: The dataset provides a foundation for developing thermal-based miner detection systems, demonstrating feasibility for emergency applications.

Conclusion: This work is a critical first step toward reliable miner detection in emergencies, paving the way for future research in safety applications.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

### [98] [Rethinking Oversaturation in Classifier-Free Guidance via Low Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21452)
*Kaiyu Song,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LF-CFG, a method to mitigate oversaturation and artifacts in diffusion models by addressing redundant low-frequency signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High guidance scales in classifier-free guidance (CFG) cause oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts, prompting the need for a solution.

Method: LF-CFG uses adaptive threshold-based measurement to identify redundant low-frequency signals and applies a down-weight strategy to reduce their impact.

Result: LF-CFG effectively reduces oversaturation and artifacts in models like Stable Diffusion-XL and SiT-XL.

Conclusion: LF-CFG provides a practical solution to improve diffusion model performance by managing low-frequency signal redundancy.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

### [99] [Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469)
*Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi,Hung-Fu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes dynamic, static, and hybrid methods for traffic signal configuration using turning movement count (TMC) data. A vision-based system estimates TMC, and simulations show 90-120s cycle times work best. Hybrid methods adapt to peak/off-peak traffic, improving flow management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TMC data is essential for traffic signal design and congestion analysis, but existing methods may not adapt well to varying traffic patterns.

Method: Developed a vision-based tracking system to estimate TMC, synthesized intersection designs, and used SUMO for simulation. Proposed dynamic, static, and hybrid signal timing methods.

Result: 90-120s cycle times performed best. Dynamic timing suited four intersections, while hybrid methods improved flow for uneven traffic distributions.

Conclusion: Hybrid signal methods, adapting to traffic patterns, outperform static methods in unevenly distributed traffic, enhancing overall traffic management.

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

TL;DR: RCME introduces a framework for explicit transitivity-enforced entailment in vision-language models, improving hierarchical representation and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning hierarchical data structure in vision-language models, particularly the lack of explicit modeling of transitive entailment.

Method: Proposes Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME) to optimize partial order of concepts, enabling hierarchical representation.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced performance in hierarchical species classification and retrieval tasks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: RCME effectively models hierarchical structures in vision-language tasks, with open-sourced code and models for broader use.

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TITAN, a method for source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) that partitions target data into easy and hard subsets, uses variance estimation, and integrates adversarial modules to improve pseudo-label reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in SF-DAOD due to noisy pseudo-labels from domain shifts, the paper aims to enhance adaptation without source data.

Method: Proposes TITAN, which partitions target images into easy/hard subsets using variance estimation and incorporates query-token adversarial modules into a student-teacher framework.

Result: TITAN outperforms SOTA methods, achieving mAP improvements of up to +22.7% on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: TITAN effectively mitigates domain shift issues and improves SF-DAOD performance through reliable pseudo-label generation and adversarial learning.

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a statistical framework for object detection to improve uncertainty quantification, addressing miscalibrated confidence scores and unexplored uncertainty in empty areas, crucial for safety in applications like automated driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors lack proper uncertainty quantification outside detected bounding boxes, posing safety risks in critical applications.

Method: The authors use a spatial statistics approach, modeling bounding box data as a marked point process to enable likelihood-based training and well-defined confidence estimates.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved calibration and performance in uncertainty assessment for drivable regions.

Conclusion: The statistical framework enhances object detection by providing reliable uncertainty estimates, benefiting safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC) is introduced to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by dynamically aligning text generation with visual evidence, improving reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free decoding strategies for LVLMs suffer from static constraints, inefficiency, and rigid rules, leading to hallucinations.

Method: DLC uses CLIP to assess semantic alignment during decoding, evaluates candidate tokens with Relative Visual Advantage (RVA), and employs adaptive weighting for balanced output.

Result: DLC significantly reduces hallucinations across benchmarks and LVLM architectures while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DLC is an effective, efficient decoding-time solution to enhance LVLM reliability by mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

TL;DR: GGTalker improves speech-driven 3D talking heads by combining generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation, achieving high-quality results with better 3D consistency and lip-sync accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with large head rotations, OOD audio, and require identity-specific training. The lack of 3D priors limits generalization.

Method: GGTalker uses a two-stage Prior-Adaptation strategy: learning Gaussian head priors (Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual) and adapting to individual characteristics. It includes a color MLP for textures and a Body Inpainter for blending.

Result: GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: GGTalker addresses key limitations in speech-driven 3D talking heads, offering a scalable and efficient solution for photorealistic synthesis.

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

*Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gradient-Guided Distillation (G²D) addresses modality imbalance in multimodal learning by using a custom loss function and dynamic modality prioritization, improving weak modality utilization and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal models suffer from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: G²D combines unimodal and multimodal objectives with a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique to balance modality contributions.

Result: G²D enhances weak modality significance and outperforms existing methods in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: G²D effectively mitigates modality imbalance, improving multimodal model performance by ensuring balanced modality utilization.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MADrive enhances scene reconstruction for autonomous driving by replacing observed vehicles with similar 3D assets from a memory bank, enabling photorealistic synthesis of altered scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene reconstructions in autonomous driving are limited to original observations and struggle with novel or altered scenarios.

Method: MADrive uses a memory-augmented framework to retrieve and integrate 3D car assets from a dataset (MAD-Cars) into scenes, aligning and relighting them for realism.

Result: The framework supports photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered driving scenarios, demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: MADrive extends the capabilities of scene reconstruction methods, enabling more flexible and realistic modeling of autonomous driving environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

TL;DR: WAFT is a new optical flow method that replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, outperforming RAFT in accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the necessity of cost volumes in optical flow methods and propose a simpler, more efficient alternative.

Method: Uses high-resolution warping instead of cost volumes, reducing memory usage and improving speed.

Result: Ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, and 4.1x faster than comparable methods.

Conclusion: WAFT demonstrates that cost volumes are not essential for high performance in optical flow, offering a simpler and more efficient solution.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective
method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with
high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This
design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is
necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible
meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs.
Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks,
achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x
faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are

*Hani Alomari,Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-modal image-text retrieval by proposing a method to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets, enhancing semantic diversity and preventing set collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-vector embeddings struggle to capture nuanced cross-modal relationships, while set-based approaches face issues like sparse supervision and set collapse.

Method: Proposes Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity for one-to-one matching between embedding sets, along with Global Discriminative Loss and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to enhance representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without external data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of set-based representations, improving cross-modal retrieval performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StruMamba3D improves Mamba-based point cloud learning by preserving spatial dependencies and enhancing SSM with state-wise updates, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods disrupt point adjacency and struggle with long-sequence memory in downstream tasks.

Method: Introduces spatial states for dependency preservation, state-wise SSM updates, and a length-adaptive strategy.

Result: Achieves 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% on ScanObjectNN without voting.

Conclusion: StruMamba3D effectively addresses SSM limitations and outperforms existing methods in point cloud tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without
voting strategy.

*Yansong Qu,Shaohui Dai,Xinyang Li,Yuze Wang,You Shen,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an occlusion-aware multi-view generation framework for 3D reconstruction from single occluded images, improving consistency and quality without prior inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction from occluded single images, which existing methods fail to handle.

Method: End-to-end framework synthesizing six consistent novel views from occluded images, trained self-supervised using Pix2Gestalt dataset and pseudo-ground-truth views.

Result: Enables improved 3D reconstruction without manual annotations or inpainting, with a new benchmark for occlusion-aware evaluation.

Conclusion: The method advances occlusion-aware 3D reconstruction, offering a standardized benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Motivation: To address the challenges of cross-modal segmentation and annotation bottlenecks in autonomous driving scenes.

Method: Introduces UMPE for feature alignment and MCMA for temporal consistency, plus a multi-modal automated data engine for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Demonstrates powerful cross-modal segmentation and efficient data annotation on Waymo-4DSeg.

Conclusion: SAM4D shows great potential for robust segmentation and scalable data annotation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of benchmarks for multiview and multimodal 3D ADS, especially in manufacturing where single-instance training and synthetic-to-real generalization are critical.

Method: Introduces a novel dataset with multiview high-resolution images, point clouds, and CAD models, and adapts singleview methods for baseline performance evaluation.

Result: Provides a comprehensive dataset and baseline results for multiview 3D ADS, highlighting challenges in synthetic-to-real generalization.

Conclusion: SiM3D sets a new standard for 3D ADS benchmarks, offering tools and insights for future research in anomaly detection and segmentation.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate how human actions shape the environment from a first-person view, addressing challenges in modeling real-world environments and embodied behaviors.

Method: Auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer trained on Nymeria dataset, using kinematic pose trajectories structured by body joint hierarchy.

Result: The model learns to predict egocentric video from actions, evaluated through a hierarchical protocol for comprehensive analysis.

Conclusion: PEVA is a pioneering approach to modeling complex environments and embodied behaviors from a human perspective.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the
environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive
conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with
video prediction from the perspective of a human.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM-based agents' understanding of contextual privacy in multi-turn conversations, revealing significant shortcomings in privacy preservation and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM-based agents can understand and preserve contextual privacy in high-stakes, multi-turn collaborative tasks.

Method: Introduces MAGPIE, a benchmark with 158 real-life scenarios across 15 domains, and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet on privacy understanding and collaboration.

Result: Current models misclassify private data as shareable (25.2%-43.6%) and disclose private information in multi-turn conversations (50.5%-59.9%). Multi-agent systems fail in 71% of tasks.

Conclusion: Existing LLM-based agents lack robust contextual privacy understanding and struggle with privacy-compliant collaboration, highlighting a critical gap for future work.

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for developing safer language model-based agents.

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes

non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that LLMs lack genuine human-like causal reasoning (level-2) and primarily perform shallow (level-1) reasoning. It introduces CausalProbe-2024 to test this and proposes G^2-Reasoner to enhance LLMs' causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities, as current models only perform shallow reasoning and lack human-like depth.

Method: Analyzes autoregression in LLMs, introduces CausalProbe-2024 benchmark, and proposes G^2-Reasoner to incorporate general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.

Result: LLMs show poor performance on CausalProbe-2024, confirming level-1 reasoning. G^2-Reasoner significantly improves their causal reasoning, especially in fresh and counterfactual contexts.

Conclusion: The work highlights a path for LLMs to advance toward genuine causal reasoning (level-2) by integrating general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts.

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

TL;DR: WAP enhances LVLMs for embodied planning by integrating environmental understanding, improving task success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with complex, unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals due to environment-agnostic approaches.

Method: WAP introduces four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, syntactic grounding) and uses curriculum learning.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL shows 60.7% absolute improvement in task success, excelling in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0).

Conclusion: WAP outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, demonstrating the value of environmental awareness in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual

*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII is an interactive explainable AI system offering tailored explanations from four methods (LIME, SHAP, Anchors, DiCE) for diverse user groups, enhancing transparency and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc explainable AI methods are static and ignore user perspectives, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Developed IXAII, a prototype with four explainable AI methods, tailored views for five user groups, and interactive control over explanations.

Result: Evaluated via expert and lay user interviews; IXAII was perceived as helpful for increasing transparency.

Conclusion: IXAII bridges gaps between explainable AI, interactivity, and practical use, advancing human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [121] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active inference AI architecture for scientific discovery, emphasizing closing abstraction, reasoning, and reality gaps over scaling models. It integrates causal models, Bayesian planning, knowledge graphs, and real-world interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are limited in scientific discovery due to brittle reasoning and separation from experimental reality. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The proposed architecture includes causal self-supervised models, Bayesian planners, knowledge graphs, and closed-loop interaction with simulators and labs.

Result: The framework enables AI to simulate, reason causally, and refine understanding through empirical validation, with human judgment as a permanent component.

Conclusion: Scientific AI progress depends on integrating internal models with external validation, ensuring human oversight for handling ambiguity and uncertainty.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [122] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE is a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture designed for robust multimodal table understanding, outperforming existing models on challenging WildStruct benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with real-world table complexities like visual degradation and structural density, leading to poor performance.

Method: TableMoE uses a Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism to predict token roles and route elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) with a confidence-aware gating strategy. It is pretrained on the TableMoE-Align dataset (1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples).

Result: TableMoE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on WildStruct benchmarks (WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, WMMFinanceMath), validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: TableMoE demonstrates the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic reasoning for robust multimodal table understanding, with interpretability and enhanced robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

*Baiqiao Yin,Qineng Wang,Pingyue Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Zihan Wang,Jieyu Zhang,Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Han Liu,Ranjay Krishna,Saining Xie,Manling Li,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindCube, a benchmark to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) on spatial mental modeling, revealing their near-random performance. It proposes a 'map-then-reason' approach, boosting accuracy by 23%, and further with reinforcement learning to 70.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if VLMs can form spatial mental models like humans, addressing gaps in reasoning about unseen space.

Method: Uses MindCube benchmark, evaluates VLMs on cognitive mapping, perspective-taking, and mental simulation. Tests three approaches, with 'map-then-reason' being most effective.

Result: Accuracy improved from 37.8% to 60.8% with 'map-then-reason', and to 70.7% with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Scaffolding spatial mental models with structured representations and flexible reasoning enhances VLMs' understanding of unobservable space.

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

*Tin Dizdarević,Ravi Hammond,Tobias Gessler,Anisoara Calinescu,Jonathan Cook,Matteo Gallici,Andrei Lupu,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to address the challenges of human evaluation in human-AI coordination, using Hanabi as a testbed. It proposes human proxy agents for reproducible evaluation and releases a dataset of 3,079 games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seamless coordination between AI and humans is crucial but challenging. Hanabi, with its unique features, is an ideal testbed, but human evaluation is costly and hard to reproduce.

Method: Developed human proxy agents from a large-scale human dataset for reproducible evaluation. Released a limited dataset of 3,079 Hanabi games and provided baseline results for two- and three-player scenarios.

Result: Proposed AH2AC2 with proxy agents for robust, cheap, and reproducible evaluation. Hosted controlled evaluation system to ensure fairness.

Conclusion: AH2AC2 and human proxy agents offer a scalable solution for human-AI coordination research, addressing the limitations of traditional human evaluations.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mind2Web 2 introduces a benchmark for evaluating agentic search systems, proposing an Agent-as-a-Judge framework to assess complex, long-horizon tasks. OpenAI Deep Research achieves 50-70% of human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to evaluate the complexity and open-endedness of agentic search systems, necessitating a new evaluation framework.

Method: Mind2Web 2 includes 130 realistic tasks and uses an Agent-as-a-Judge framework with task-specific judge agents for automated assessment.

Result: OpenAI Deep Research performs at 50-70% of human efficiency, spending half the time.

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for future agentic search system development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

TL;DR: PsyLite, a lightweight AI-driven psychological counseling model, improves dialogue safety, scenario handling, and deployment efficiency using a two-stage training strategy and innovative RAG techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deficiencies in existing AI-driven psychological counseling models, such as dialogue safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment.

Method: Developed PsyLite based on InternLM2.5-7B-chat, using hybrid distillation data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization. Deployed with Ollama and Open WebUI, incorporating conditional RAG for humor and safety.

Result: Outperforms baselines in CEval, CPsyCounE, and SafeDialBench, with significant improvements in professionalism (47.6%) and safety (2.4%). Achieves low hardware deployment (5GB memory).

Conclusion: PsyLite provides an efficient, safe, and lightweight solution for AI-driven psychological counseling, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

### [127] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark (LUCARIO) and framework for probabilistic QA over tabular data, combining Bayesian Networks and LLMs, outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems (e.g., NL2SQL) struggle with probabilistic questions requiring uncertainty reasoning.

Method: Induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses LLMs for answer generation.

Result: Significant improvements over baselines, showcasing hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses probabilistic QA, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

### [128] [Multi-lingual Functional Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20793)
*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques static benchmarks for evaluating multi-lingual competence in LLMs and introduces dynamic functional benchmarks (CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval) across five languages, revealing performance drops and varying robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks like Belebele, M-MMLU, and M-GSM inadequately assess practical performance and robustness in multi-lingual settings.

Method: Developed CL-GSM Symbolic and CL-IFEval by translating English functional benchmarks into French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Yoruba.

Result: Performance drops between static and functional benchmarks (e.g., 24% for M-GSM vs. CL-GSM Symbolic in English). Robustness varies, with Arabic and English being most consistent.

Conclusion: Functional benchmarks better capture real-world performance and highlight language-specific robustness, urging reevaluation of static benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

### [129] [The Ideation-Execution Gap: Execution Outcomes of LLM-Generated versus Human Research Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20803)
*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated research ideas initially appear more novel than human ideas, but their execution leads to poorer research outcomes, closing the novelty gap and often reversing rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI-generated research ideas lead to better executed research outcomes compared to human-generated ideas.

Method: An execution study with 43 expert researchers implementing and documenting randomly assigned LLM or human-generated ideas, followed by blind expert reviews.

Result: LLM-generated ideas scored significantly worse post-execution on novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall metrics, often reversing initial rankings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to generate truly effective research ideas, and evaluating ideas without execution is challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiFinRAG is a multimodal RAG framework for financial QA, outperforming ChatGPT-4o by 19 points in accuracy by integrating text, tables, and images with efficient retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial documents combine diverse modalities (text, tables, figures), challenging traditional LLMs and RAG pipelines due to token limits and fragmented context.

Method: MultiFinRAG uses a lightweight multimodal LLM for extraction, embeds outputs with modality-aware retrieval, and employs a tiered fallback strategy for cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o on complex financial QA tasks.

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG effectively addresses multimodal financial QA challenges, offering superior performance on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' ability to handle morally ambiguous violent content using a social science tool (VBVQ), revealing biases in their responses across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine LLMs' reasoning in morally ambiguous, real-world violent scenarios and assess potential biases in their responses.

Method: Used the Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ) and persona-based prompting to vary demographics. Evaluated six LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: LLMs' surface-level text generation often mismatches their internal violent preferences, and their responses vary contradictorily across demographics.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases and inconsistencies in handling violent content, diverging from established human behavioral findings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in applying end-to-end fact-checking systems to medicine, highlighting issues like claim-evidence mismatches and subjective veracity labels, and suggests treating fact-checking as an interactive communication problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high-stakes nature of medical decisions and the inadequacy of general medical literacy make automated fact-checking appealing, yet such systems remain underutilized.

Method: The study examines how clinical experts verify real social media claims by synthesizing medical evidence, identifying challenges in end-to-end fact-checking.

Result: Key challenges include connecting claims to clinical trials, ambiguities in claims, and subjective veracity labels.

Conclusion: Fact-checking in medicine should be approached as an interactive communication problem, not an end-to-end process.

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve language model adaptation, including novel pre-training, efficient fine-tuning, and better evaluation benchmarks, enhancing robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in adapting large language models (LMs) efficiently and robustly to specific tasks, especially with limited labeled data and high computational costs.

Method: Introduced continued pre-training for unlabeled data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, improved supervised fine-tuning, and new evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Substantial improvements in LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization across diverse NLP tasks.

Conclusion: These advances bring LMs closer to artificial general intelligence by enhancing adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

TL;DR: A new pipeline for curating multilingual pre-training datasets, FineWeb2, is introduced, improving model performance over prior datasets and supporting over 1000 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of creating high-quality multilingual datasets due to language-specific filtering and deduplication difficulties motivates the development of an adaptable pipeline.

Method: The pipeline is designed to automatically adapt to any language, with ablation studies on nine languages and a novel evaluation task selection process. It also includes a rebalancing approach considering duplication and quality.

Result: The pipeline produces more performant models than prior datasets and scales to create FineWeb2, a 20TB multilingual dataset covering over 1000 languages.

Conclusion: FineWeb2 and its pipeline offer a scalable, high-quality solution for multilingual LLM pre-training, with released codebases for broader use.

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

TL;DR: KaLM-Embedding-V2 is a compact embedding model with innovations like bidirectional transformers, multi-stage training, and data diversity, achieving top performance on MTEB benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a versatile and compact embedding model that outperforms larger models while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Uses bidirectional transformers, multi-stage training (pre-training, fine-tuning, model-soup averaging), and novel techniques like focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing.

Result: Significantly outperforms comparable models and competes with much larger ones on MTEB benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sets a new standard for compact embedding models with under 1B parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B
parameters.

### [136] [Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20989)
*Eric Zhang,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether fine-tuning can emulate prompting in language models, proposing a meta-training method where gradient updates mimic prompting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the effectiveness of prompting and the storage efficiency of fine-tuning, enabling models to generalize like prompted ones.

Method: Meta-training LMs using gradient-based meta-learning, leveraging the model's own prompted predictions as targets instead of ground-truth labels.

Result: Fine-tuning with this method recovers some or all prompted performance, improving tasks like the 'reversal curse' and single-update question answering.

Conclusion: Gradient descent can be expressive with proper initialization, opening new avenues for long-context modeling and understanding gradient-based learning.

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

*Adithya Chittem,Aishna Shrivastava,Sai Tarun Pendela,Jagat Sesh Challa,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) to include the 16PF model and introduces a framework (SAC) for controlling trait intensity in LLMs, improving personality expression consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personality models rely on coarse Big Five dimensions and lack trait intensity control, limiting nuanced human-like interactions.

Method: Extended MPI with 16PF model and developed SAC framework using adjective-based semantic anchoring and five intensity factors for dynamic trait control.

Result: Continuous trait intensity modelling improves consistency and controllability, with systematic influence on related traits, indicating multi-dimensional personality internalization.

Conclusion: The work advances nuanced human-machine interactions, applicable in healthcare, education, and interviews, moving closer to human-like social machines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CA-Ben is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning, tested on six models with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o leading. Challenges in numerical and legal tasks highlight areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' domain-specific financial knowledge, especially in the Indian context, where such evaluation is lacking.

Method: Developed CA-Ben benchmark using ICAI exam datasets, tested six LLMs with standardized protocols.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o performed best, but numerical and legal tasks posed challenges.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have strengths and limitations; hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented methods could enhance performance.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

*Chunyuan Yuan,Chong Zhang,Zheng Fang,Ming Pang,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Ching Law*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework (SSUF) is proposed to unify query classification tasks in e-commerce, addressing issues like insufficient query information and dependency on posterior labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce queries are short and lack context, and existing methods rely on click behavior, creating inefficiencies and a Matthew vicious cycle. Subtasks also lack a unified framework.

Method: SSUF includes knowledge-enhanced, label-enhanced, and structure-enhanced modules to improve query and label representations and reduce dependency on posterior labels.

Result: SSUF outperforms state-of-the-art models in offline and online A/B experiments.

Conclusion: SSUF provides a scalable, unified solution for query classification, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MT2-CSD, a large dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational stance detection, and proposes LLM-CRAN, a model leveraging LLMs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stance detection lacks datasets capturing real social media dynamics, limiting progress in conversational stance detection.

Method: Proposes LLM-CRAN, a model using LLMs for better conversational understanding, tested on the MT2-CSD dataset.

Result: LLM-CRAN outperforms baselines in conversational stance detection.

Conclusion: MT2-CSD and LLM-CRAN advance conversational stance detection by addressing dataset scarcity and improving model performance.

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DALR improves multimodal sentence representation by addressing cross-modal misalignment and intra-modal divergence through dual-level alignment learning, outperforming baselines on STS and TR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align images and text coarsely, suffering from cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, degrading representation quality.

Method: DALR uses a consistency learning module for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and integrates ranking distillation with intra-modal alignment to capture complex sentence relationships.

Result: DALR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks.

Conclusion: DALR effectively addresses alignment challenges, enhancing multimodal sentence representation quality and performance.

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a chunk-based approach using self-supervised learning (SSL) models and a CNN-BiLSTM framework for automatic fluency assessment (AFA), improving performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFA is challenging, especially in capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers.

Method: Uses SSL models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) with a CNN-BiLSTM framework, segmenting speech into chunks via Silero-VAD and enriching with fluency markers.

Result: Improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points on Speechocean762, and 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion is effective for fluency evaluation, but future work should address dialects with irregular prosody.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Conclusion: ComRAG effectively leverages historical interactions and domain knowledge, proving superior for industrial CQA.

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for

lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Progtuning is a novel fine-tuning framework for Transformer-based models that progressively reduces updated blocks, saving 25% parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency in parameter updates across Transformer blocks during fine-tuning, optimizing resource allocation.

Method: Progressively reduces the number of updated Transformer blocks based on their contribution.

Result: Reduces updated parameters by ~25% without compromising performance; adaptable to parameter-efficient methods.

Conclusion: Progtuning efficiently optimizes resource use and maintains competitive performance, suitable for diverse adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cosmos introduces a compressed latent space for text generation using diffusion models, offering faster inference and better coherence compared to autoregressive and token-level diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are slow and struggle with global coherence, while diffusion models face challenges with high-dimensional token representations. Cosmos aims to address these issues.

Method: Cosmos uses a compressed latent space learned via an autoencoder, trained for token-level reconstruction and alignment with a pretrained language encoder, enabling efficient diffusion-based generation.

Result: Cosmos compresses text representations by 8x, matches or surpasses baseline models in quality, and achieves 2x faster inference.

Conclusion: Cosmos is a promising alternative for text generation, combining efficiency, quality, and flexibility across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel transformer-based model for turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems, dynamically controlled via textual prompts like 'faster' or 'calmer', improves accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing turn-taking prediction in dialogue systems with intuitive, explicit control to adapt dynamically to conversational contexts.

Method: Extends a transformer-based voice activity projection model by incorporating textual prompt embeddings into channel-wise and cross-channel transformers. Synthetic prompts were generated using an LLM.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and adaptable turn-taking timing behaviors based on textual prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively integrates textual prompts for dynamic control, demonstrating feasibility and improved performance in turn-taking prediction.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using syntactic retrieval for few-shot prompting in Automatic Term Extraction (ATE), showing improved performance over semantic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are underutilized for ATE, and semantic similarity may not be the best approach for retrieving demonstrations.

Method: Proposes a retrieval-based prompting strategy using syntactic similarity for few-shot ATE, evaluated in in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Syntactic retrieval improves F1-score on three ATE benchmarks, especially in capturing term boundaries.

Conclusion: Syntactic cues are crucial for adapting LLMs to ATE tasks, offering domain-agnostic reliability.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

### [150] [Cat and Mouse -- Can Fake Text Generation Outpace Detector Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21274)
*Andrea McGlinchey,Peter J Barclay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether increasingly large language models (LLMs) will outpace simple classifiers in generating deceptive text, focusing on classical detective fiction. Results show mixed progress, suggesting detection may remain feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if newer, larger LLMs will surpass simple classifiers in generating deceptive text, potentially making detection harder.

Method: Examined the ability of statistical classifiers to detect artificially generated text in classical detective fiction, comparing models like Gemini and GPT over a 0.5 version increase.

Result: Gemini improved in generating deceptive text, while GPT did not, indicating detection may still be feasible despite model growth.

Conclusion: Reliable detection of fake text may remain possible even as models grow, though new architectures could enhance deceptiveness.

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Double-Checker enhances slow-thinking LLMs by enabling iterative self-critique and refinement, improving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of LLMs in generating informative critiques and refining solutions.

Method: Introduces Double-Checker, a framework for iterative self-critique and refinement, fine-tuned on 1,730 self-critical instances.

Result: Pass@1 performance on AIME benchmarks improved from 4.4% to 18.2%.

Conclusion: Iterative self-critique significantly boosts LLM reasoning, offering a path to more trustworthy and effective models.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

*Istabrak Abbes,Gabriele Prato,Quentin Fournier,Fernando Rodriguez,Alaa Boukhary,Adam Elwood,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lightweight encoder models like RoBERTa and NomicBERT can detect groundedness in queries as accurately as large LLMs, reducing latency and resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate ungrounded responses when context lacks information, harming reliability. Detecting groundedness before answer generation can improve efficiency.

Method: Fine-tuned lightweight encoder models (RoBERTa, NomicBERT) on curated datasets for groundedness detection.

Result: Achieved accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3 8B, GPT4o) with significantly lower inference latency.

Conclusion: Lightweight models offer a cost-effective solution for groundedness detection, enhancing LLM efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

### [153] [Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21294)
*Bram Willemsen,Gabriel Skantze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A text-only autoregressive language model is used to extract referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue, showing effectiveness despite limitations of unimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if linguistic context alone can detect mentions with visual referents in dialogue.

Method: Adapt a pretrained LLM for coarse-grained mention span annotation via next-token prediction, using small datasets and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Text-only approach is effective, emphasizing linguistic context's importance, but task remains inherently multimodal.

Conclusion: While linguistic context is crucial, the task's multimodal nature limits unimodal approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

*Fangzhou Dong,Yifan Zeng,Yingpeng Sang,Hong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLASS, a framework based on Greimas Semiotic Square, enhances LLMs' ability to perform professional literary criticism by dissecting narrative structures and deep meanings. It includes a dataset, quantitative metrics, and outperforms expert criticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with in-depth literary analysis, especially for complex narratives. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured framework for professional literary criticism.

Method: Proposes GLASS, a framework using Greimas Semiotic Square, and introduces a dataset of 48 works with detailed analyses. Uses LLM-as-a-judge for quantitative metrics.

Result: GLASS shows high performance compared to expert criticism and is applied to 39 classic works, producing original analyses.

Conclusion: GLASS provides an AI-based tool for literary research and education, offering insights into cognitive mechanisms of literary engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding and generating text but
struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

### [155] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-RAG is a framework enhancing RAG systems by improving query understanding, retrieval, and generation for noisy, ambiguous, and multi-intent queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current RAG systems in handling noisy and complex real-world queries.

Method: Uses LLM-assisted query understanding, intent-aware retrieval, and reranking with BGE and Falcon-10B.

Result: Improves robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings.

Conclusion: Omni-RAG bridges the gap between RAG capabilities and real-world application demands.

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

### [156] [Domain Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs for Fraud and Concept Drift Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21443)
*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A DK-Enhanced LLM framework improves fraud and concept drift detection by integrating domain knowledge with LLMs, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolving language patterns and concept drift make detecting deceptive conversations challenging, requiring enhanced methods beyond standard LLMs.

Method: The framework combines pretrained LLMs with domain knowledge, featuring modules for fake conversation detection, drift detection, and drift classification.

Result: The system achieves 98% accuracy in classifying fake conversations and effectively identifies drift types.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly enhances performance and interpretability in high-stakes NLP tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address
these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework
that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to
perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists
of three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive
conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a
semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the
drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain
knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to
SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and
spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high
accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift. Guided by structured
prompts, the LLaMA-based implementation achieves 98% classification accuracy.
Comparative studies against zero-shot baselines demonstrate that incorporating
domain knowledge and drift awareness significantly improves performance,
interpretability, and robustness in high-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across English, Spanish, and Turkish, revealing performance disparities due to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation shows minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the multilingual performance of LLMs in Text2Cypher tasks, addressing the lack of non-English evaluations in database query generation.

Method: Created a multilingual test set by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish, preserving Cypher queries. Evaluated models using standardized prompts and metrics.

Result: Performance was highest in English, followed by Spanish, and lowest in Turkish, attributed to training data and linguistic differences. Prompt translation had negligible impact.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for inclusive multilingual evaluation and development, suggesting future work on schema localization and fine-tuning for diverse languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

*Anne Wu,Laurent Mazaré,Neil Zeghidour,Alexandre Défossez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns preferences for spoken dialogue models using real-time speech interactions, improving factual accuracy, safety, and contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference learning methods are text-focused and inadequate for real-time speech dynamics like interruptions and interjections.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 150,000 preference pairs from speech conversations is created, annotated with AI feedback. Offline alignment methods fine-tune a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model.

Result: Feedback improves spoken dialogue models, making interactions more factual, safer, and contextually aligned. Human evaluations confirm impact beyond single-turn conversations.

Conclusion: Balancing dynamics is crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue systems, as demonstrated by the framework's success.

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopK LMs, a modified transformer architecture with a TopK activation function, to address shortcomings of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpretability and feature stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs, used for analyzing transformer-based LMs, have limitations like unclear concept discovery and unstable features across checkpoints.

Method: The authors modify the transformer architecture by adding a TopK activation function, eliminating post-hoc SAE training and ensuring interpretable sparse representations.

Result: TopK LMs maintain original capabilities while offering robust interpretability, enabling neuron interventions and detailed analysis of concept learning.

Conclusion: TopK LMs provide a stable, efficient, and interpretable alternative to SAEs, advancing research in model interpretability and controllability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in transitioning from offline to online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks.

Method: Comparison of online and semi-online Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, with experiments on verifiable math and non-verifiable instruction following.

Result: Online and semi-online methods perform similarly and outperform offline methods. Multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards improves performance.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning in online/semi-online regimes is highly effective, with multi-tasking further enhancing results.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance user engagement in socially-driven dialogues by aligning interactive LLMs with future conversation signals, using a user simulator and i×MCTS for data collection and DPO for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works focus on knowledge or dialogue acts but fail to guarantee user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. The paper aims to directly optimize for engagement.

Method: Leverages user reactions as rewards, uses a user simulator and i×MCTS to explore interactions, and aligns LLMs via DPO.

Result: Experiments show improved user engagement in emotional support and persuasion dialogues.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs for socially-driven dialogues.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

*Marina Mancoridis,Bec Weeks,Keyon Vafa,Sendhil Mullainathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper questions the validity of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs, arguing they may create an illusion of understanding (potemkins) unless LLMs mirror human misunderstandings. It introduces methods to detect potemkins and finds them widespread, indicating deeper incoherence in LLMs' concept representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that benchmark performance reflects true understanding in LLMs, highlighting the risk of 'potemkins'—false understanding not aligned with human reasoning.

Method: Introduces a formal framework and two procedures: one using a custom benchmark in three domains, the other a general method to estimate potemkins' prevalence.

Result: Potemkins are found to be common across models, tasks, and domains, revealing not just incorrect understanding but deeper incoherence in LLMs' concept representations.

Conclusion: Benchmarks may mislead about LLMs' true capabilities; detecting potemkins is crucial for accurate evaluation, revealing deeper flaws in LLMs' understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Motivation: To understand how users interact with LLMs for healthcare information and identify inherent risks, such as incomplete context and sycophancy, to improve LLM healthcare support.

Method: Filtered large-scale conversational AI datasets to create HealthChat-11K, then analyzed user interactions using a clinician-driven taxonomy across 21 health specialties.

Result: Revealed common interactions, incomplete context, affective behaviors, and sycophancy-inducing questions, emphasizing the need for better LLM healthcare support.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity for improvements in LLM healthcare capabilities and provides a dataset for further research.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

Motivation: To address the underexplored area of optimizing training data organization (Data Efficacy) alongside data efficiency for better language model performance.

Method: Proposes DELT, a framework with Data Scoring (LQS) and Data Ordering (FO) components, focusing on learnability, quality, and addressing issues like model forgetting.

Result: DELT improves LM performance; LQS and FO combination yields the most significant gains. Data efficacy complements data efficiency.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training, enhancing performance without additional data or model scaling.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

### [166] [Progressive Size-Adaptive Federated Learning: A Comprehensive Framework for Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Data Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20685)
*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan,Naima Iltaf,Ihtesham ul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFL introduces a size-based adaptive federated learning framework, revealing optimal dataset sizes and modality performance hierarchies, achieving high accuracy and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL approaches overlook dataset size impact on training dynamics, necessitating a framework like SAFL to address this gap.

Method: SAFL organizes FL based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data, tested on 13 diverse datasets.

Result: SAFL achieves 87.68% average accuracy, with structured data reaching 99%+, and reduces data transfer to 7.38 GB.

Conclusion: SAFL provides theoretical and practical insights for FL deployments, optimizing performance based on data characteristics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

*Ugo Lomoio,Tommaso Mazza,Pierangelo Veltri,Pietro Hiram Guzzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-ABIN is a user-friendly, explainable framework for anomaly detection in biological networks, combining machine learning and graph-based deep learning to identify disease-related gene anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust, interpretable tools to analyze complex omics data and identify disease-driving genes, overcoming limitations of current single-dataset approaches.

Method: E-ABIN integrates SVM, Random Forests, GAEs, and GAANs for anomaly detection in gene expression or methylation networks.

Result: Case studies in bladder cancer and coeliac disease show E-ABIN effectively identifies biologically relevant anomalies and provides disease insights.

Conclusion: E-ABIN offers a unified, interpretable platform for anomaly detection in biological networks, advancing disease mechanism understanding.

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

### [168] [On Context-Content Uncertainty Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20699)
*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), a framework for inference under uncertainty, and develops a layered computational model with four hierarchical operational principles to minimize entropy asymmetrically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize how brains and machines minimize uncertainty by aligning high-entropy contexts with low-entropy, structured content.

Method: A layered computational framework with four hierarchical levels: Core Inference Constraints, Resource Allocation Principles, Temporal Bootstrapping Dynamics, and Spatial Hierarchical Composition. Formal theorems and simulations validate the approach.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency gains in CCUP-aligned inference, with formal proofs and simulations supporting the framework's validity.

Conclusion: CCUP provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding uncertainty minimization in brains and machines through recursive structure-specificity alignment.

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

### [169] [Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701)
*Vineet Jain,Kusha Sareen,Mohammad Pedramfar,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS) and its greedy variant, DTS*, to improve inference-time alignment in diffusion models by reusing past computations and refining value estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for steering pretrained diffusion models suffer from inaccurate value estimation and inefficient compute use, especially at high noise levels.

Method: The authors propose a tree-based approach inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search, propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates.

Result: DTS matches the FID of the best baseline with 10x less compute on MNIST and CIFAR-10, while DTS* finds high-reward samples with 5x less compute in text-to-image and language tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, anytime algorithm for inference-time alignment, improving sample quality with additional compute.

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

### [170] [On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705)
*Kin Kwan Leung,Rasa Hosseinzadeh,Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the theoretical foundation of FLIPD, an LID estimator for diffusion models, proving its correctness under realistic assumptions and exploring its applicability with uniform convolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the incomplete theoretical underpinnings of FLIPD, which was previously proven only under unrealistic affine submanifold assumptions, and to explore its broader applicability.

Method: The authors formally prove the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions and extend the analysis to uniform convolutions instead of Gaussian ones.

Result: The results confirm FLIPD's correctness under realistic conditions and demonstrate its potential with uniform convolutions.

Conclusion: The work strengthens FLIPD's theoretical foundation and broadens its practical relevance, enhancing its utility in tasks like outlier detection and AI-generated text identification.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores if test-time scaling methods for LLMs, effective in math reasoning, generalize to theoretical physics. A novel symbolic weak-verifier framework is introduced, outperforming existing methods on TPBench and AIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if test-time scaling techniques for LLMs, successful in math reasoning, can be applied to advanced theoretical physics and to improve performance using problem structure.

Method: Developed a symbolic weak-verifier framework for physics problems, evaluated on TPBench and AIME datasets, and compared with existing scaling methods.

Result: The new method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench and also proves effective on AIME.

Conclusion: Step-wise symbolic verification is powerful for complex scientific problems, bridging the gap between math and physics reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.

*Minh-Hao Van,Prateek Verma,Chen Zhao,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) are revolutionizing materials science by enabling scalable, general-purpose AI systems. This survey covers their applications, tools, and challenges, while outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the transformative potential of FMs in materials science, addressing diverse research challenges and enabling cross-domain generalization.

Method: A task-driven taxonomy is introduced, covering six application areas, and recent advances in unimodal/multimodal FMs and LLM agents are reviewed. Standardized datasets and tools are also discussed.

Result: Early successes of FMs are noted, but limitations like generalizability, interpretability, and data imbalance persist.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and trustworthiness to overcome current challenges.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

### [173] [Multiple Streams of Relation Extraction: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20746)
*Todd Nief,David Reber,Sean Richardson,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuned LLMs store and retrieve relation information, proposing dynamic weight-grafting to reveal dual pathways: extraction during entity processing and recall before prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and how fine-tuned LLMs store and retrieve relation information, addressing gaps in existing localization methods.

Method: Dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained models to analyze information pathways.

Result: Fine-tuned models use both extraction and recall pathways, with recall involving task-specific attention and relation extraction in final layers.

Conclusion: The study identifies distinct pathways for relation information in fine-tuned LLMs, highlighting their necessity and redundancy in different contexts.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

*Huangyuan Su,Mujin Kwun,Stephanie Gil,Sham Kakade,Nikhil Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates block-scaled precision formats (e.g., MX formats) for training large language models, identifying stochastic instabilities and proposing stabilization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of training large language models by leveraging lower-precision arithmetic formats for efficiency gains.

Method: Analyzes nearly 1,000 language models trained with varying precision formats, conducts controlled experiments on a proxy model, and proposes stabilization strategies.

Result: Identifies instabilities in MX formats, attributes them to gradient bias, and demonstrates hybrid configurations can recover performance.

Conclusion: Hybrid precision schemes can mitigate instabilities and maintain competitive performance with full-precision training.

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

*Xinghao Dong,Huchen Yang,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent score-based generative AI framework is proposed for stochastic closure models in nonlinear dynamical systems, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling multiscale dynamical systems without clear scale separation, where resolving all scales is computationally expensive.

Method: Joint training of convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in latent spaces to reduce dimensionality and preserve physical characteristics.

Result: The framework achieves computational acceleration with comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed latent conditional diffusion model offers an efficient and accurate solution for stochastic closure modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

### [176] [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20790)
*Lucius Bushnaq,Dan Braun,Lee Sharkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD), a scalable and robust alternative to Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD) for decomposing neural networks. SPD addresses APD's computational cost and hyperparameter sensitivity, enabling decomposition of larger models and better performance in identifying ground truth mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decomposition methods, like APD, are impractical due to high computational costs and hyperparameter sensitivity, limiting their scalability and application to larger models.

Method: The authors propose SPD, a method that improves scalability and robustness to hyperparameters compared to APD. It avoids issues like parameter shrinkage and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models.

Result: SPD successfully decomposes slightly larger and more complex models than APD, demonstrating improved scalability and robustness. It also bridges causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods.

Conclusion: SPD removes barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition, opening new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability. The authors release a library for SPD implementation and reproducibility.

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LLM-powered 'GPU Kernel Scientist' automates GPU kernel optimization, using evolutionary methods and LLMs to refine code iteratively without deep human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels is complex, especially for newer architectures with scarce documentation. The goal is to democratize and accelerate this process using LLMs.

Method: The approach uses LLMs in a multi-stage process: selecting prior code versions, generating optimization hypotheses, and autonomously implementing experiments with timing feedback.

Result: While quantitative results are embargoed, the design and workflow show promise for LLM-driven GPU optimization in resource-constrained or evolving hardware.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agents can democratize GPU kernel optimization, reducing reliance on human expertise and accelerating performance tuning.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

*Shashwat Khandelwal,Jakoba Petri-Koenig,Thomas B. Preußer,Michaela Blott,Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to deploy LSTMs on FPGAs using the FINN framework, addressing computational complexity and enabling efficient, accurate inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSTMs are effective for time-series tasks but face computational challenges in resource-constrained environments. FPGAs offer energy-efficient acceleration, but existing tools lack support for LSTMs.

Method: Leverages the FINN framework and ONNX Scan operator to model LSTM computations, introduces custom transformations for hardware mapping, and validates with a quantised ConvLSTM model for stock prediction.

Result: The generated accelerator balances performance and resource use, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art models in accuracy with reduced precision.

Conclusion: The proposed flow generalizes LSTM deployment on FPGAs, paving the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerators.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods like bagging and boosting are computationally expensive and struggle with heterogeneous data. Hellsemble addresses these issues by focusing on instance-level difficulty.

Method: Hellsemble partitions data into difficulty levels, trains specialized models on each, and uses a router model to assign instances.

Result: Outperforms classical ensemble methods on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks.

Conclusion: Instance-level difficulty is a promising approach for efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for detecting adversarial examples in DNNs by analyzing layer-wise impact differences, offering efficiency and universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the understudied area of adversarial attack detection, highlighting the limitations of existing defense methods in effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Trains a lightweight regression model to predict deeper-layer features from early-layer features, using prediction error for detection.

Result: Highly effective, computationally efficient, compatible with any DNN, and applicable across domains like image, video, and audio.

Conclusion: The proposed detection method is practical, efficient, and universally applicable, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses performance degradation in distributed GNN training for link prediction, proposing SpLPG to reduce communication costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed GNN frameworks are optimized for node classification, leaving link prediction performance underexplored, especially regarding graph partitioning and negative sampling issues.

Method: The study investigates performance degradation causes and introduces SpLPG, leveraging graph sparsification to mitigate information loss and reduce communication overhead.

Result: Experiments show SpLPG reduces communication costs by up to 80% while largely preserving link prediction accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SpLPG effectively balances communication efficiency and accuracy, making distributed GNN training for link prediction more scalable.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving
link prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The CDRL approach successfully optimizes time allocation, improving communication quality in integrated sensing and communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of adaptive time allocation in integrated

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance scanning for new targets and tracking existing ones in cognitive radar systems, optimizing trade-offs in dynamic environments.

Method: Formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, solved using DDPG and SAC algorithms, and compared their performance. NSGA-II was used to estimate the Pareto front.

Result: Both DDPG and SAC are effective, but SAC shows better stability and sample efficiency. NSGA-II provides an upper bound on the Pareto front.

Conclusion: The study advances adaptive cognitive radar systems by efficiently balancing competing objectives, with SAC being a superior choice.

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

*Fei Wang,Baochun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA fine-tuning reduces memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining task performance, diverging from trends in pre-training and full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of memorization in fine-tuning, especially for LoRA, a parameter-efficient method, and compare it with pre-training and full fine-tuning.

Method: Re-examined memorization using a similarity-based metric, focusing on LoRA fine-tuning, model scale, and data duplication.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly reduces memorization risks without compromising performance, unlike full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LoRA fine-tuning offers a safer alternative to full fine-tuning by mitigating memorization risks while preserving effectiveness.

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize performance profiling by leveraging LLMs for accurate, lightweight, and model-agnostic predictions of GPU kernel metrics.

Method: Introduces Omniwise, a model-agnostic, self-supervised pipeline that predicts performance metrics (e.g., memory bandwidth, GFLOPs) directly from kernel code.

Result: Achieves over 90% predictions within 10% relative error on AMD MI250 and MI300X GPUs. Includes an online inference server and VSCode plugin.

Conclusion: Omniwise successfully integrates LLMs into performance profiling, offering a practical and accurate tool for developers.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented

powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and
MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online
inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RWFT is a lightweight output-reweighting unlearning method that erases a class from a trained classifier without full retraining, outperforming existing methods in metrics and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of full retraining and the failure of existing unlearning methods to replicate retrained model behavior, especially for enforcing deletion rights and mitigating bias.

Method: Proposes RWFT, a technique redistributing probability mass for predictions on the forgotten class, robust against MIA-NN attacks, and introduces a TV-based metric for leakage quantification.

Result: Matches full retraining results in prior metrics and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.79% and 111.45% in new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT effectively removes classes without retraining, is robust to attacks, and sets a new standard for evaluating unlearning methods.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

*Erfan Hajihashemi,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm is proposed to dynamically select effective models, reducing computational complexity and prediction set size while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of computational complexity and poor performance due to irrelevant models in multi-model online conformal prediction.

Method: Uses a bipartite graph to refine model subsets dynamically, selecting models based on feedback (prediction set size and loss) to construct prediction sets.

Result: Ensures valid coverage, achieves sublinear regret, and constructs smaller prediction sets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm improves efficiency and performance in multi-model online conformal prediction, validated by experiments on real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, focusing on single-policy guarantees and general weakly communicating MDPs, introducing a novel algorithm with sharp empirical-span-based penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome challenges like distribution shift and non-uniform coverage in average-reward MDPs, which are underexplored theoretically.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm using pessimistic discounted value iteration with quantile clipping, enabling sharper penalties without prior parameter knowledge.

Result: They achieve the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound and handle general weakly communicating MDPs, with near-matching lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work highlights the necessity of coverage assumptions beyond the target policy's stationary distribution, distinguishing it from prior research.

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'black box' nature of neural networks in deep reinforcement learning by enhancing explainability, particularly in radar resource management.

Method: Propose DL-LIME, integrating deep learning into LIME's sampling process to account for feature correlations.

Result: DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME in fidelity and task performance, offering insights into decision-making factors.

Conclusion: DL-LIME enhances explainability and performance in radar resource management, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

*Tong Zeng,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Janghoon Ock,Cheng-Kai Lai,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework autonomously infers chemical process constraints and optimizes production, outperforming traditional methods in speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with ill-defined constraints, requiring subjective heuristics. This work aims to automate constraint inference and optimization.

Method: Uses a multi-agent LLM framework (AutoGen with OpenAI's o3 model) for constraint generation, validation, simulation, and optimization.

Result: Achieved 31-fold speedup over grid search, converging in under 20 minutes with competitive performance.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient and effective for poorly characterized constraints, promising for emerging or retrofit processes.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

*Shahrzad Behzadimanesh,Pierre Le Bodic,Geoffrey I. Webb,Mario Boley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes extending traditional rule ensembles by introducing learnable sparse linear transformations to improve accuracy without sacrificing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule ensembles rely on axis-parallel decision regions, which require curated features for accuracy. This limits interpretability when complex rules are needed.

Method: The authors introduce propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations (e.g., $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$) and a sequential greedy optimization method based on iteratively reweighted logistic regression.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves comparable test risk to state-of-the-art methods while reducing model complexity on ten benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed extension enhances rule ensembles by enabling oblique decision regions, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: MSA, a new algorithm, leverages model checkpoints to efficiently unlearn problematic datapoints in large language models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often train on problematic data (private, copyrighted, or inaccurate), and retraining is computationally expensive. Unlearning algorithms aim to remove such data influence cheaply.

Method: Proposes MSA, which uses model checkpoints to estimate and undo the influence of specific datapoints without full retraining.

Result: MSA outperforms existing unlearning algorithms across benchmarks, models, and metrics.

Conclusion: MSA offers a flexible and efficient solution for data erasure in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational methods for antibody design struggle with geometric feature capture and generalization to novel antigen interfaces, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: AbMEGD integrates multi-scale equivariant graph diffusion, combining atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings for sequence and structure co-design.

Result: Experiments show a 10.13% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32% improvement percentage, and 0.062 Å reduction in RMSD in the CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb.

Conclusion: AbMEGD sets a new benchmark for antibody design, balancing structural integrity and functionality, with potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharpZO is a hybrid method combining sharpness-aware evolutionary strategies and zeroth-order optimization to fine-tune VLMs without backpropagation, achieving better performance than existing forward-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BP-free fine-tuning methods for VLMs, like ES or ZO optimization, often underperform due to high variance or inefficiency. SharpZO aims to improve accuracy and convergence.

Method: SharpZO uses a two-stage process: sharpness-aware ES for global exploration and smoothing, followed by sparse ZO optimization for fine-grained local search, all without backpropagation.

Result: SharpZO outperforms state-of-the-art forward-only methods, achieving up to 7% average accuracy gain and faster convergence.

Conclusion: SharpZO is an effective BP-free fine-tuning method for VLMs, offering significant performance improvements for memory-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Motivation: Explicit density learners like normalizing flows offer advantages over GANs but face challenges in training and sampling quality. The study aims to enhance these models using knowledge distillation.

Method: Novel knowledge distillation techniques are applied to compositional normalizing flows, leveraging non-traditional knowledge transfer between intermediate layers.

Result: Distilled student models achieve significant performance improvements and reduced size, leading to higher throughput due to fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation effectively enhances normalizing flows, enabling smaller, more efficient models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

*Feng Jiang,Mangal Prakash,Hehuan Ma,Jianyuan Deng,Yuzhi Guo,Amina Mollaysa,Tommaso Mansi,Rui Liao,Junzhou Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT integrates molecular SMILES, text, and taxonomic data for property prediction, using novel alignment objectives to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works neglect textual and taxonomic data in molecular representation learning, limiting predictive performance.

Method: TRIDENT combines SMILES, text, and taxonomic annotations with volume-based and local alignment objectives, balanced dynamically.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data improves molecular property prediction significantly.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

*Haodong Lu,Chongyang Zhao,Jason Xue,Lina Yao,Kristen Moore,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA introduces a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach for continual learning, addressing interference, redundancy, and ambiguous routing in LoRA-based MoE methods by decomposing rank updates into fine-grained rank-1 experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and task interference in continual learning with large pre-trained models, overcoming limitations of existing LoRA-based MoE approaches.

Method: Decomposes rank-r updates into r rank-1 components, enabling fine-grained expert utilization. Introduces self-activated relevance inference, rank pruning, and activation budgets for adaptive sparse rank selection.

Result: Validated on CLIP and LLMs, MoRA enhances continual learning, improves generalization, and mitigates forgetting.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively addresses key challenges in continual learning with pre-trained models, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

### [198] [An Information-Theoretic Analysis for Federated Learning under Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21036)
*Fu Peng,Meng Zhang,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses concept drift in federated learning (FL) by proposing an algorithm to mitigate performance degradation. It models drift as a Markov chain, introduces a metric for assessing model generalization, and validates the approach experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data streams often have shifting distributions, causing performance degradation in FL. Existing methods focus on static datasets, leaving a gap for handling dynamic data.

Method: The paper models concept drift as a Markov chain, derives an upper bound for generalization error using KL divergence and mutual information, and proposes a regularization-based algorithm. Three drift patterns are studied.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods across three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, random), validated by experiments on a Raspberry Pi4 testbed.

Conclusion: The method effectively adapts to concept drift in FL, demonstrating improved long-term performance and a clear performance-cost tradeoff.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-Selector, a reinforcement learning-based method for efficient data selection in deep learning, outperforming existing methods by reducing redundancy and improving training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets in deep learning are computationally expensive and often redundant, necessitating more efficient training paradigms.

Method: The paper proposes RL-Selector, a lightweight RL agent that optimizes data selection using epsilon-sample cover to quantify redundancy and guide the selection process.

Result: RL-Selector outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, enhancing model generalization and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces dataset redundancy and improves training efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

TL;DR: SSE is a hierarchical RL framework enforcing strict subgoal reachability, improving exploration and planning for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in long-horizon goal-conditioned RL, such as sparse rewards and subgoal infeasibility.

Method: Uses Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE) with decoupled exploration and failure-aware path refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in efficiency and success rate across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SSE effectively tackles long-horizon RL challenges with structured constraints and adaptive planning.

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

*He Zhang,Ming Zhou,Shaopeng Zhai,Ying Sun,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A regret-aware method for unsupervised skill discovery improves efficiency and diversity by framing skill discovery as a min-max game and using temporal representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unsupervised skill discovery lack efficiency, especially in high-dimensional scenarios, despite good exploration capabilities.

Method: Proposes a min-max game between skill generation and policy learning, using regret to guide skill discovery and a learnable skill generator to avoid degeneration.

Result: Outperforms baselines in efficiency and diversity, achieving a 15% zero-shot improvement in high-dimensional environments.

Conclusion: The regret-aware method effectively balances exploration and policy learning, enhancing skill discovery in complex environments.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

### [202] [FedDAA: Dynamic Client Clustering for Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21054)
*Fu Peng,Ming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAA is a federated learning framework addressing multi-source concept drift (real, virtual, label drift) by dynamically clustering clients, detecting drift types, and adapting while retaining useful historical knowledge, outperforming existing methods by 7.84%-8.52% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods mainly tackle real drift, failing to handle virtual or label drift, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Identifying drift sources is crucial for optimal adaptation.

Method: FedDAA uses three modules: cluster number determination, real drift detection, and concept drift adaptation, to dynamically adapt to drift while preserving historical data.

Result: FedDAA improves accuracy by 7.84%-8.52% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 compared to state-of-the-art methods, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: FedDAA effectively addresses multi-source concept drift in FL, outperforming existing methods by explicitly identifying and adapting to different drift types while retaining valuable historical knowledge.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using knowledge graphs to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs improves their tool utilization and problem-solving abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLMs' tool usage requires better instruction data, as previous methods relying on LLM-generated data were insufficient.

Method: Extract query pathways from knowledge graphs, transform them into user queries, and translate entity relationships into tools and solution steps.

Result: Fine-tuning on synthetic data significantly boosts LLMs' tool utilization and capabilities.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs provide a scalable way to create high-quality instruction data for improving LLMs.

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

TL;DR: CHOOSE is a shallow Transformer framework enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) for wireless symbol detection, improving reasoning without increasing depth, making it efficient for resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Transformer models for wireless communication tasks are storage and computationally expensive, limiting deployment on mobile devices.

Method: Introduces autoregressive latent reasoning steps in hidden space to enhance shallow Transformers (1-2 layers) without adding depth.

Result: Outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and matches deep models' performance while being storage and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CHOOSE offers a lightweight solution for deploying Transformer-based algorithms in resource-constrained wireless receivers.

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FeDa4Fair, a library for benchmarking fairness in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client bias, addressing limitations in current fairness research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in FL is challenged by biases in local datasets and the lack of methods addressing diverse fairness needs across clients.

Method: The authors propose FeDa4Fair, a library for generating datasets and benchmarking fairness-aware FL methods, along with ready-to-use evaluation functions.

Result: Four bias-heterogeneous datasets and benchmarks are released to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled setting.

Conclusion: The work aims to enhance fairness research in FL by providing tools for consistent and reproducible evaluation at global and client levels.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

TL;DR: H-CMR is a new interpretable Concept-Based Model (CBM) that provides transparency for both concept and task predictions using a hierarchical reasoning approach with learned logic rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBMs lack interpretability in concept predictions, relying on black-box neural networks. H-CMR aims to address this by making both concept and task predictions interpretable.

Method: H-CMR uses a learned directed acyclic graph to model concept relationships, applying logic rules hierarchically with neural attention for inference.

Result: H-CMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while enabling human interventions to improve accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: H-CMR enhances interpretability and performance in CBMs, supporting human interaction for better model outcomes.

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

### [207] [Learning to Skip the Middle Layers of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21103)
*Tim Lawson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture for dynamically skipping middle layers in Transformers was proposed, but it did not improve efficiency compared to dense baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage redundancy in middle Transformer layers and reduce compute for simpler tokens.

Method: Dynamic skipping of symmetric spans of central blocks using learned gating, gated attention, and adaptive regularization.

Result: No improvement in trade-off between validation cross-entropy and FLOPs compared to fewer-layer dense baselines.

Conclusion: The approach did not achieve efficiency gains at the investigated scales; code was released for further exploration.

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unlasting, a dual conditional diffusion model framework (DDIB) to address unpaired single-cell perturbation data, integrating GRN and a masking mechanism for improved gene expression prediction and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell sequencing is destructive, leading to unpaired data under perturbed and unperturbed conditions, which existing methods handle poorly by forcing pairings or ignoring inherent relationships.

Method: Uses Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to map data distributions, integrates GRN for biologically meaningful signal propagation, and employs a masking mechanism to predict silent genes. Introduces a new evaluation metric for bimodal distributions.

Result: Unlasting effectively handles unpaired data, improves gene expression profile quality, and captures intrinsic heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key challenges in single-cell perturbation analysis, offering a robust solution with biological relevance and improved evaluation.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an antifragile RL framework for UAV navigation, using discounted Thompson sampling (DTS) to dynamically select robust policies against adversarial attacks, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods lack generalization to out-of-distribution adversarial attacks, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: Proposes an antifragile RL framework with DTS-based switching among robust policies, modeled as a multiarmed bandit problem to handle nonstationary rewards.

Result: The framework achieves shorter navigation paths and higher conflict-free rates in simulations with dynamic obstacles and strong adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The antifragile RL approach outperforms conventional robust RL methods, demonstrating adaptability and effectiveness against unseen adversarial threats.

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

*Deepak Kumar Panda,Adolfo Perrusquia,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An antifragile RL framework is proposed to counter OOD adversarial attacks in UAV navigation, improving resilience and performance under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies in safety-critical systems like UAV navigation are vulnerable to OOD adversarial attacks, leading to unsafe decisions.

Method: The framework uses a simulated attacker to incrementally perturb observations, enforcing adaptation via Wasserstein distance minimization.

Result: The antifragile policy outperforms baselines, achieving higher rewards and fewer conflicts under attacks.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for secure decision-making in evolving threat scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.

*Andrey Goncharov,Daniil Vyazhev,Petr Sychev,Edvard Khalafyan,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient fine-tuning method for LLMs using entropy-based complexity categorization, outperforming standard SFT and matching distillation with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLM performance in specific domains without costly distillation or excessive data.

Method: Splits training data by entropy, uses SFT and distillation for fine-tuning, focusing on complex data.

Result: Outperforms standard SFT (0.55 vs 0.43 accuracy) and matches distillation with 62% less data.

Conclusion: Efficient fine-tuning via entropy-based complexity categorization is viable and effective.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Norm-Aware Linear Attention (NaLaFormer) to address entropy gaps and missing interactions in linear attention by decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, improving performance on vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear attention methods neglect query norms and inhibit negative values, leading to entropy gaps and missing interactions. The paper aims to restore dynamic spikiness and norm consistency.

Method: Proposes decoupling query and key matrices into norm and direction components, using a query-norm aware kernel for dynamic entropy control and norm-preserving mapping for non-negativity.

Result: NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks by up to 4.2%, enhancing expressiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of linear attention, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

TL;DR: DiLoCoX is a decentralized training framework for large models (100B+ parameters) on slow networks, combining pipeline parallelism, dual optimizer policy, and adaptive gradient compression for significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of large models relies on fast, centralized clusters; DiLoCoX aims to enable training on slower, decentralized networks.

Method: DiLoCoX integrates pipeline parallelism, dual optimizer policy, one-step-delay overlap of communication and local training, and adaptive gradient compression.

Result: Empirically, DiLoCoX trains a 107B model on a 1Gbps network, achieving a 357x speedup over vanilla AllReduce with minimal convergence impact.

Conclusion: DiLoCoX is the first decentralized framework effective for 100B+ parameter models, enabling efficient training on slow networks.

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

*Ziwei Wang,Hongbin Wang,Tianwang Jia,Xingyi He,Siyang Li,Dongrui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBConformer, a dual-branch CNN-Transformer hybrid, improves EEG decoding by modeling long-range temporal and spatial dependencies, outperforming 10 baselines with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-based EEG decoding lacks long-range temporal and inter-channel modeling, and existing hybrids suboptimally integrate local and global features.

Method: Proposes DBConformer with temporal and spatial Conformers, plus a channel attention module, for EEG decoding.

Result: Outperforms 10 baselines on motor imagery and seizure detection datasets, with fewer parameters and interpretable features.

Conclusion: DBConformer is robust, explainable, and efficient for EEG decoding, with public code.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

### [215] [Generative Adversarial Evasion and Out-of-Distribution Detection for UAV Cyber-Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21142)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cGAN-based framework is proposed to generate stealthy adversarial attacks that evade UAV IDS, countered by a CVAE detector outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IDS and OOD detectors fail against novel and stealthy adversarial attacks in UAV systems, necessitating advanced solutions.

Method: A cGAN crafts adversarial attacks misclassified as benign, while a CVAE uses negative log-likelihood to detect these stealthy threats.

Result: CVAE-based detection outperforms Mahalanobis distance methods in identifying adversarial attacks, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic modeling like CVAE is crucial for robust IDS against generative-model-based cyber threats.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: pFedDC is a personalized federated learning framework using dual-prompt learning and cross fusion to address data heterogeneity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges from data, computation, and communication heterogeneity. Pretrained vision-language models offer potential, but current methods ignore joint label-domain shifts.

Method: pFedDC employs dual-prompt learning (global and local prompts) and a cross-fusion module to integrate prompts adaptively for personalized representations.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: pFedDC effectively addresses heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Prototype Routing (LPR) to address load imbalance in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, achieving near-perfect load balancing without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE systems suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a few experts are activated, underutilizing model capacity and resources.

Method: The authors revisit expert routing through clustering and introduce LPR, a novel routing framework that generalizes existing approaches.

Result: LPR reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 and improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70.

Conclusion: LPR effectively balances expert utilization in MoE models, enhancing efficiency without degrading performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

TL;DR: Proposes linearity-based compression for neural networks, achieving lossless compression to 1/4 of original size, compatible with other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network compression by leveraging linear behavior in ReLU-like activations for weight reduction.

Method: Uses linearity in ReLU-like activations to merge layers, evaluated experimentally.

Result: Achieves lossless compression to 1/4 of original size, works well with pruned models.

Conclusion: Introduces a new compression method for smaller, efficient neural networks, compatible with existing techniques.

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces diverse mini-batch selection in reinforcement learning using determinantal point processes, applied to drug discovery to improve solution diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating instances in real-world applications like reinforcement learning is costly, and diverse exploration is crucial to avoid mode collapse and enhance learning.

Method: Proposes diverse mini-batch selection using determinantal point processes, tested in drug discovery with molecular generation oracles.

Result: The framework significantly improves solution diversity while maintaining high quality, potentially accelerating drug discovery.

Conclusion: Diverse mini-batch selection enhances exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly beneficial in drug discovery for faster, high-quality solutions.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

TL;DR: ScalaBL introduces a scalable Bayesian low-rank adaptation method for LLMs, achieving competitive performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate and are poorly calibrated, making uncertainty quantification critical, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: Bayesian inference in an r-dimensional subspace using LoRA parameters as projection matrices, enabling scalable stochastic variational inference.

Result: Competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, requiring only ~1000 additional parameters and scaling to larger LLMs.

Conclusion: ScalaBL provides an efficient and scalable solution for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

TL;DR: Perpetual voting fairness is challenged by partial turnout. Artificial Delegates (preference-learning agents) are introduced to improve fairness and representativeness, showing reliable mitigation of absenteeism effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in sequential collective decision-making under partial turnout, as full participation assumptions are impractical.

Method: Integrate Artificial Delegates (preference-learning agents) into perpetual voting systems to represent absent voters.

Result: Artificial Delegates effectively mitigate fairness issues caused by absenteeism and enhance system robustness.

Conclusion: Artificial Delegates are a viable solution to improve fairness and representativeness in perpetual voting systems with partial participation.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach addresses data limitations and aids in accurate obsolescence risk forecasting.

Abstract: Component obsolescence poses significant challenges in industries reliant on

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel seeding methods for k-means and k-GMM, improving performance over existing techniques with modest overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clustering initialization by formalizing and optimizing seeding techniques, addressing limitations of current methods.

Method: Proposes lookahead and multipass strategies for seed selection, focusing on coherence with final metrics and reducing randomization effects.

Result: Achieves consistent constant factor improvements in SSE (k-means) and log-likelihood (k-GMM), outperforming recent multi-swap strategies.

Conclusion: The methods are practical and theoretically promising, potentially becoming standard techniques while enabling new analytical approaches.

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AGTCNet, a novel graph-temporal model for MI-EEG classification, addressing challenges in subject- and session-invariant BCI systems. It outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy, speed, and compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCI systems struggle with variability in neural activity and EEG hardware constraints, lacking effective spatiotemporal dependency capture in EEG signals.

Method: Proposes AGTCNet, integrating graph convolutional attention networks to learn spatiotemporal EEG representations using EEG electrode topography.

Result: AGTCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced model size (49.87%), faster inference (64.65%), and higher accuracy (66.82% subject-independent, up to 90.54% subject-specific).

Conclusion: AGTCNet is effective and practical for BCI deployment, offering superior performance and efficiency in MI-EEG classification.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks for LLMs are static and don't reflect real-time data processing needs in modern applications.

Method: DynamicBench uses a dual-path retrieval pipeline (web searches + local databases) and tests models with/without external documents.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o by significant margins.

Conclusion: DynamicBench effectively evaluates LLMs' real-time data handling and report generation, with plans to release code and data publicly.

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proves a uniform Lipschitz bound for persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, ensuring stability under local updates and enabling reliable error control in dynamic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downstream tools like heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks rely on persistent Laplacian eigenvalues, but the impact of adding a single simplex on these eigenvalues was unknown.

Method: The authors establish a uniform Lipschitz bound, showing that adding one simplex changes any up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue by at most twice the Euclidean norm of the simplex's boundary.

Result: The bound is independent of filtration scale and complex size, providing the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.

Conclusion: This result ensures stability of spectral features under local updates and supports reliable error control in dynamic data applications.

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

*Melanie Rieff,Maya Varma,Ossian Rabow,Subathra Adithan,Julie Kim,Ken Chang,Hannah Lee,Nidhi Rohatgi,Christian Bluethgen,Mohamed S. Muneer,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMMILE is the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks, revealing limitations in current MLLMs' ability to learn from multimodal context, with performance affected by irrelevant examples and recency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians often need to adapt to specialized tasks with limited examples, but the ability of MLLMs to learn multimodal tasks from context in medicine is unexplored.

Method: Introduces SMMILE, a benchmark with 111 expert-curated problems (517 triplets), and SMMILE++ (1038 permuted problems), evaluating 15 MLLMs on multimodal ICL.

Result: Most MLLMs show poor multimodal ICL ability; ICL improves performance modestly (8-9.4%). Performance degrades with irrelevant examples and improves with recency bias.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have critical limitations and biases in learning multimodal medical tasks from context, highlighting the need for better models.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

Motivation: To enhance sample efficiency and long-term training in pixel-based deep reinforcement learning by regularizing Q-value distributions.

Method: Uses an auxiliary MSE loss to equalize Q-value distributions of augmented images.

Result: Boosts DrQ, SAC, and Data-Efficient Rainbow on MuJoCo and Atari tasks, surpassing state encoding baselines.

Conclusion: rQdia effectively improves model-free continuous control from pixels, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: rQdia regularizes Q-value distributions with augmented images in pixel-based
deep reinforcement learning. With a simple auxiliary loss, that equalizes these
distributions via MSE, rQdia boosts DrQ and SAC on 9/12 and 10/12 tasks
respectively in the MuJoCo Continuous Control Suite from pixels, and
Data-Efficient Rainbow on 18/26 Atari Arcade environments. Gains are measured
in both sample efficiency and longer-term training. Moreover, the addition of
rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state
encoding baseline.

TL;DR: The paper explores combining fine-grained error resilience in DNNs with hardware approximation to boost energy efficiency, achieving 54% energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency in low-power DNN computing by leveraging hardware approximation and error resilience.

Method: Systematically distributes ROUP approximate multipliers across DNN layers, filters, and kernels, evaluating impact on accuracy and energy using ResNet-8 on CIFAR-10.

Result: Achieves up to 54% energy savings with ≤4% accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances energy efficiency and accuracy, making it viable for low-power DNN applications.

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

*Chao Zhou,Tom Jacobs,Advait Gadhikar,Rebekka Burkholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NANOADAM dynamically updates small-magnitude weights during finetuning, reducing resource use and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finetuning large pretrained models is resource-intensive; small-magnitude weights correlate with large gradients, suggesting targeted updates could optimize efficiency.

Method: Propose NANOADAM, which selectively updates small-magnitude weights (gradient-free) during finetuning, preserving large-magnitude weights to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Result: NANOADAM allows larger learning rates, improves generalization, and performs well on NLP and vision tasks.

Conclusion: NANOADAM offers a practical, efficient finetuning approach by focusing on small-magnitude weights, enhancing performance while reducing resource costs.

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ATGAT, a graph neural network with temporal embedding and triple attention, outperforming traditional methods in cryptocurrency fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of complex transaction patterns and class imbalance in fraud detection, where traditional methods fail to capture temporal and structural dependencies.

Method: ATGAT uses (1) multi-scale temporal embedding, (2) temporal-aware triple attention, and (3) weighted BCE loss for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.9130, improving 9.2% over XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over GAT.

Conclusion: ATGAT enhances fraud detection with temporal awareness and attention mechanisms, offering a generalizable solution for financial institutions.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes early-stopping in-context learning for tabular foundation models to reduce inference costs without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference-time costs of tabular foundation models, especially for larger datasets, necessitate efficiency improvements.

Method: Dynamically evaluates stopping in-context learning after each Transformer encoder layer, using a pre-trained decoder for embeddings.

Result: Achieves speedups of up to x1.3 on small tasks and x2.2 on larger tasks with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: Early exiting is a practical strategy to enhance efficiency in tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

TL;DR: D-CHAG improves efficiency for vision-based scientific models by reducing memory usage and increasing throughput on large-scale systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for tokenizing and aggregating images in vision-based scientific models are compute-intensive and inefficient.

Method: Introduces Distributed Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG), compatible with any model-parallel strategy and vision transformer architecture.

Result: Achieved 75% reduction in memory usage and more than doubled throughput on 1,024 AMD GPUs.

Conclusion: D-CHAG is a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale vision-based scientific tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSCP is a generative policy for offline RL that combines expressiveness with efficiency by predicting completion vectors in one step, avoiding iterative sampling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high inference costs and training instability of iterative sampling in generative models like diffusion and flow-matching for offline RL.

Method: Propose SSCP, trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict completion vectors directly, enabling one-shot action generation.

Result: SSCP scales effectively across offline, offline-to-online, and online RL, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and adaptability.

Conclusion: SSCP is a versatile, efficient, and expressive framework for deep RL, achieving strong results in offline RL and behavior cloning.

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

TL;DR: Multimodal machine learning improves deception detection in dyadic interactions by combining speech and facial data from both participants, achieving 71% accuracy with late fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance deception detection by integrating multimodal data (audio and video) from both deceiver and deceived, addressing gaps in dyadic interaction analysis.

Method: Compared early and late fusion approaches using Action Units and gaze data from Swedish speakers in truth/lie scenarios.

Result: Combining speech and facial data outperformed single-modality methods, with late fusion on both modalities and participants yielding 71% accuracy.

Conclusion: Supports psychological theories on expression control and provides a foundation for studying dyadic interactions, especially in psychotherapy.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

*Jens Püttschneider,Simon Heilig,Asja Fischer,Timm Faulwasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training method for ResNets inspired by optimal control, penalizing intermediate outputs to prune unnecessary layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge ResNets and optimal control, enabling layer pruning via theory-grounded training dynamics.

Method: Penalize intermediate outputs (hidden states) as stage costs in optimal control, using skip connections and output layers.

Result: Unnecessary deeper layers' weights vanish, suggesting effective pruning.

Conclusion: The approach offers a theory-backed strategy for layer pruning in ResNets.

Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control
problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss
functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs
of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For
standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state
through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate
that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

TL;DR: A hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning approach optimizes low-storage ESRK methods, improving computational efficiency by 25% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency in high-order, low-storage ESRK methods is challenging. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics or exhaustive searches.

Method: Combines GA-driven mutations for exploration and RL-inspired state transitions for dynamic heuristic selection, reducing parameters while preserving fourth-order accuracy.

Result: Validated on benchmark problems, achieving 25% runtime reduction in IPOPT compared to traditional ESRK methods, with maintained stability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates adaptive heuristic discovery's potential to enhance resource efficiency in simulations, broadening ESRK applicability in demanding fields like CFD and physics.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study in Telangana (2020) found low screening rates for cervical (3.3%), breast (0.3%), and oral cancer (2.3%). An ML-based system was developed to predict susceptibility and guide users to nearby hospitals, aiming to improve awareness and reduce mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low awareness and screening rates for cervical and breast cancer in Telangana, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Early detection is crucial but underutilized.

Method: Developed ML classification models (decision tree for cervical cancer, SVM for breast cancer) to predict susceptibility. Integrated a system for locating nearby hospitals and maintaining health records.

Result: The system provides predictions for cancer susceptibility and directs users to treatment centers, enhancing awareness and accessibility.

Conclusion: The solution advances cancer awareness and literacy in Telangana, potentially reducing mortality by improving early detection and access to care.

Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for
cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3
percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is
the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness
about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We
developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to
breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to
provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based
on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised fault diagnosis method for CPSs integrates anomaly detection, process mining, and stochastic simulation to automate and improve fault modeling and root cause analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual fault modeling in CPSs is complex and error-prone, requiring domain expertise. The paper aims to automate this process for better accuracy and interpretability.

Method: The approach combines multivariate time-series anomaly detection, process mining to create structured event logs, and stochastic simulation using Petri nets for root cause analysis.

Result: Validated on the Robotic Arm Dataset, the method effectively models, simulates, and classifies faulty behaviors, aiding predictive maintenance and digital twin development.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances fault diagnosis in CPSs by automating and improving the interpretability of fault models, supporting industrial applications like predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

Result: No single detector performs best across all datasets, and current model selection methods are suboptimal.

Conclusion: mTSBench enables reproducible comparisons and aims to drive progress in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores grokking in large language model pretraining, revealing delayed generalization and pathway evolution from memorization to generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mysterious phenomenon of grokking in large-scale models and demystify its generalization mechanism.

Method: Analyze checkpoints during pretraining of a 7B LLM (OLMoE), compute training loss, and evaluate generalization on diverse tasks. Investigate internal dynamics via pathway evolution.

Result: Grokking occurs in large models; pathways evolve from random to structured, reducing complexity. Novel metrics predict generalization.

Conclusion: Pathway analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for grokking, with practical metrics for monitoring generalization during pretraining.

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

### [243] [Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930)
*Chi-Sheng Chen,Xinyu Zhang,Ya-Chuan Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical RL framework for Taiwan stock market sector rotation shows quantum models outperform in training but lag in real-world metrics, highlighting reward design challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum-enhanced models in financial reinforcement learning and address the gap between training rewards and real-world performance.

Method: Uses PPO with classical (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) models, automated feature engineering, and empirical backtesting.

Result: Quantum models achieve higher training rewards but underperform in real-world metrics like cumulative return and Sharpe ratio.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges in reward design and quantum model stability, suggesting improvements like reward shaping and regularization.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

improve the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary
differential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog
Rydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also
introduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom
quantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using
analog quantum neural ODEs.

### [245] [On Uniform Weighted Deep Polynomial approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21306)
*Kingsley Yeon,Steven B. Damelin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces weighted deep polynomial approximants for functions with asymmetric behavior, outperforming traditional methods like Taylor and Chebyshev approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of polynomial approximations for non-smooth or singular functions, especially those with asymmetric growth and decay.

Method: Proposes a class of weighted deep polynomial approximants, combining learnable deep polynomials with one-sided weights to capture local non-smoothness and global growth.

Result: Numerical results show superior performance over Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles asymmetric functions and offers a stable optimization strategy, advancing rational approximation techniques.

Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain
non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be
efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential
convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast,
polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem
\cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can
recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In
this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial
approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded
on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep
polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and
global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor,
Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the
same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we
propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.

*Lucas Romao,Hugo Villamizar,Romeu Oliveira,Silvio Alonso,Marcos Kalinowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores agile management for ML-enabled systems, identifying key themes and challenges through a systematic mapping study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic nature of ML development challenges traditional project management, necessitating tailored agile approaches.

Method: A systematic mapping study using hybrid search strategies (database searches and snowballing) analyzed 27 papers.

Result: Identified 8 frameworks and categorized practices into 8 themes, with effort estimation as the main challenge.

Conclusion: The study maps current knowledge but highlights the need for more empirical validation of agile methods in ML contexts.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society,
driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their
flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this
dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the
context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches.
[Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for
ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a
hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and
forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers
published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and
categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable
Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A user-friendly Python-based method using rdflib is introduced to integrate Neo4j databases with OWL, simplifying ontology generation for adverse drug event datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of data and the need for seamless integration of Neo4j with OWL highlight the demand for accessible ontology generation methods, especially for users unfamiliar with description logics.

Method: The approach leverages Python and rdflib to automate class and axiom generation from a Neo4j database, demonstrated using FDA FAERS data.

Result: A practical solution is developed, enabling smoother ontology integration and supporting drug safety monitoring.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap in ontology generation, offering a scalable and user-friendly solution for handling large adverse drug event datasets.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

Result: User feedback revealed insights into ease of use, relevance, transparency, responsiveness, accuracy, and recommendation likelihood.

Conclusion: Twelve key lessons were documented, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges for RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [249] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for developing complex model transformations (MTs) with human guidance, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually developing complex MTs is error-prone and infeasible; RL can help but struggles in complex scenarios, where human guidance is beneficial.

Method: The approach maps user-defined MTs onto RL primitives, executing them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences, incorporating uncertain human advice.

Result: Human guidance, even uncertain, significantly boosts RL performance and enables more efficient development of complex MTs.

Conclusion: The method advances RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering by balancing the certainty and timeliness of human advice.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Synthline v1 enhances synthetic requirements data generation with advanced strategies, showing improved quality and performance over human-authored data in specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of labeled requirements datasets hinders AI for Requirements Engineering (AI4RE). Synthetic data generation offers a solution, but quality control methods are underexplored.

Method: Synthline v1 extends an earlier version with advanced generation and curation techniques. It evaluates prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization (PACE), and post-generation curation across four classification tasks.

Result: Multi-sample prompting improves utility and diversity (F1-score gains: 6-44 points). PACE boosts functional classification (+32.5 points) but reduces others. Synthetic data matches or outperforms human data in security (+7.8 points) and defect classification (+15.4 points).

Conclusion: Systematic synthetic generation mitigates dataset scarcity, offering practical insights for AI4RE.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient application of CoT techniques in APR due to complex logic and multi-step reasoning requirements.

Method: Systematically evaluates CoT techniques and proposes $T^3$, integrating LLMs with tree search for better reasoning and repair precision.

Result: $T^3$ enhances candidate repair solution precision and optimizes sample selection and repair strategies.

Conclusion: $T^3$ establishes a robust framework for efficient automated debugging in APR.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness of Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in hydrological predictions, particularly rainfall-runoff modeling.

Method: Train ten randomly initialized TFT and LSTM models for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US and five subsets of the Caravan dataset (US, Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, Chile). Assess performance, variability, and dataset differences.

Result: TFT slightly outperforms LSTM, excels in handling longer sequences, and identifies key variables. Both models show performance drops with the Caravan dataset.

Conclusion: TFT shows promise for hydrological modeling and understanding, though data quality impacts performance.

Abstract: Combining attention with recurrence has shown to be valuable in sequence
modeling, including hydrological predictions. Here, we explore the strength of
Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) over Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
in rainfall-runoff modeling. We train ten randomly initialized models, TFT and
LSTM, for 531 CAMELS catchments in the US. We repeat the experiment with five
subsets of the Caravan dataset, each representing catchments in the US,
Australia, Brazil, Great Britain, and Chile. Then, the performance of the
models, their variability regarding the catchment attributes, and the
difference according to the datasets are assessed. Our findings show that TFT
slightly outperforms LSTM, especially in simulating the midsection and peak of
hydrographs. Furthermore, we show the ability of TFT to handle longer sequences
and why it can be a better candidate for higher or larger catchments. Being an
explainable AI technique, TFT identifies the key dynamic and static variables,
providing valuable scientific insights. However, both TFT and LSTM exhibit a
considerable drop in performance with the Caravan dataset, indicating possible
data quality issues. Overall, the study highlights the potential of TFT in
improving hydrological modeling and understanding.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ClusterRCA is a novel framework for diagnosing network failures in HPC systems by combining classifier-based and graph-based methods using multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address data heterogeneity and accuracy in HPC systems, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: ClusterRCA extracts features from NIC pairs, constructs a failure graph, and uses a customized random walk to localize root causes.

Result: Experiments show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy and robustness in diagnosing HPC network failures.

Conclusion: ClusterRCA effectively addresses the challenges of network failure diagnosis in HPC systems.

Abstract: Network failure diagnosis is challenging yet critical for high-performance
computing (HPC) systems. Existing methods cannot be directly applied to HPC
scenarios due to data heterogeneity and lack of accuracy. This paper proposes a
novel framework, called ClusterRCA, to localize culprit nodes and determine
failure types by leveraging multimodal data. ClusterRCA extracts features from
topologically connected network interface controller (NIC) pairs to analyze the
diverse, multimodal data in HPC systems. To accurately localize culprit nodes
and determine failure types, ClusterRCA combines classifier-based and
graph-based approaches. A failure graph is constructed based on the output of
the state classifier, and then it performs a customized random walk on the
graph to localize the root cause. Experiments on datasets collected by a
top-tier global HPC device vendor show ClusterRCA achieves high accuracy in
diagnosing network failure for HPC systems. ClusterRCA also maintains robust
performance across different application scenarios.

*Anish Saxena,Po-An Tsai,Hritvik Taneja,Aamer Jaleel,Moinuddin Qureshi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Speculative decoding boosts token throughput in dense LLMs but is ineffective for MoE models due to increased data movement and verification time. Cascade, a utility-driven framework, dynamically tunes speculation to avoid slowdowns and improve MoE serving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU memory bandwidth is a bottleneck for low-latency LLM inference. Speculative decoding is ineffective for MoE models, causing slowdowns, necessitating a dynamic solution.

Method: Cascade uses a lightweight metric (speculation utility) to selectively enable speculation and dynamically adjust the number of draft tokens (K) to optimize performance.

Result: Cascade limits slowdown to 5% and improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding practical for MoEs.

Conclusion: Cascade successfully addresses the inefficiency of speculative decoding in MoE models, enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: GPU memory bandwidth is the main bottleneck for low-latency Large Language
Model (LLM) inference. Speculative decoding leverages idle GPU compute by using
a lightweight drafter to propose K tokens, which the LLM verifies in parallel,
boosting token throughput. In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are
fetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,
greatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is
ineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,
increasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput
gains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,
making it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,
and even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense
LLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.
  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables
speculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE
serving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of
token gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,
enabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each
request, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during
testing, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the
utility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and
evaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,
extraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and
improves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding
practical for MoEs.

Main category: q-bio.CB

TL;DR: scMamba is a foundation model for integrating single-cell multi-omics data without feature selection, preserving genomic positional information and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for single-cell multi-omics integration often discard biological information during preprocessing. scMamba aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: scMamba uses a patch-based cell tokenization strategy and state space duality, along with contrastive learning enhanced by cosine similarity regularization.

Result: scMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and improving downstream tasks like clustering and trajectory inference.

Conclusion: scMamba is a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, advancing biological discovery.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the
simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells.
Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular
identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains
challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes
or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial
biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed
to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature
selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a
patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words
(tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space
duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional,
sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive
learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables
superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods.
Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological
variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as
clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings
position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics
integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models show promise but lack precision in high-accuracy tasks, requiring post-training to align with applications, similar to human motor skill acquisition.

Method: The paper reviews post-training strategies through human motor learning, categorizing them into environmental perception, embodiment awareness, task comprehension, and multi-component integration.

Result: A structured taxonomy and conceptual framework are introduced, highlighting key challenges and trends in VLA model post-training.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive overview and practical insights for VLA model development, guiding future research.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust planning and decision-making in rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios for autonomous driving, especially in cooperative settings.

Method: Proposes V2X-REALM with three innovations: (i) prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation, (ii) gated multi-scenario adaptive attention, and (iii) multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex driving conditions.

Conclusion: Advances scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and

safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

*Jun Cen,Chaohui Yu,Hangjie Yuan,Yuming Jiang,Siteng Huang,Jiayan Guo,Xin Li,Yibing Song,Hao Luo,Fan Wang,Deli Zhao,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WorldVLA integrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world models to unify action and image understanding/generation, showing mutual enhancement but struggles with autoregressive action sequences due to error propagation. An attention mask strategy improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify action and image understanding/generation by integrating VLA and world models, aiming to improve action generation through learned environmental physics.

Method: Combines VLA and world models in a single framework, using autoregressive prediction for future images and actions. Introduces an attention mask to mitigate error propagation in action sequences.

Result: WorldVLA outperforms standalone models, demonstrating mutual enhancement. The attention mask strategy significantly improves action chunk generation.

Conclusion: WorldVLA successfully unifies action and image tasks, with the attention mask addressing autoregressive action sequence limitations.

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.

*Alexandre Girard,Steven A. Parkison,Philippe Hamelin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for drone-based power line inspection using LiDAR, focusing on accurate conductor tracking despite challenges like minimal surface detection and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localizing drones relative to power line conductors with LiDAR is challenging due to sparse data, inconsistent detection, and noise.

Method: Proposes a single geometric model for the entire conductor array to minimize error between LiDAR measurements and the model, avoiding individual conductor tracking.

Result: Achieves accurate tracking with solver convergence under 50 ms per frame, tolerating partial observations and outliers.

Conclusion: The method is robust, handling noise and outliers effectively, making it suitable for real-time drone inspections.

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic thermal images from RGB data, addressing the lack of thermal imagery in existing datasets for robotics and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras are valuable in degraded environments but lack sufficient data for widespread use in robotics. Existing datasets lack thermal imagery, hindering adaptation.

Method: The authors use conditional diffusion models with self-attention to convert RGB images to synthetic thermal images, learning real-world thermal properties.

Result: The method enables augmentation of datasets with synthetic thermal data, facilitating broader adoption of thermal cameras in autonomous systems.

Conclusion: Synthetic thermal data generation via diffusion models can bridge the data gap, accelerating thermal camera integration in robotics and automation.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CovDocker, a benchmark for covalent docking, addressing gaps in current methods by focusing on covalent bond formation and structural changes. It decomposes the process into three tasks and uses advanced models to establish baselines, showing promise for covalent drug design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing docking methods and deep learning approaches often overlook covalent bond formation and structural changes, limiting their effectiveness in covalent drug design.

Method: The authors decompose covalent docking into reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking tasks, using models like Uni-Mol and Chemformer to establish baseline performances.

Result: The benchmark effectively predicts interaction sites and models molecular transformations, demonstrating its potential for advancing covalent drug design.

Conclusion: CovDocker serves as a rigorous framework for covalent docking research, highlighting data-driven approaches' potential to accelerate the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and address therapeutic challenges.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.

TL;DR: MegaFold accelerates AlphaFold3 training by optimizing compute and memory usage, enabling longer sequence training without memory issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold3's high compute and memory demands hinder scalability, prompting the need for an efficient system like MegaFold.

Method: MegaFold uses ahead-of-time caching, Triton-based kernels, and deep fusion to address bottlenecks in AF3 training.

Result: MegaFold reduces peak memory usage by 1.23× and speeds up training by 1.73× (NVIDIA) and 1.62× (AMD), enabling 1.35× longer sequences.

Conclusion: MegaFold significantly improves the scalability of protein folding models like AlphaFold3.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EraRAG introduces a scalable, dynamic Graph-RAG framework using hierarchical LSH-based partitioning for efficient updates without full-graph reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph-RAG systems struggle with scalability in dynamic environments due to costly full-graph updates for new documents.

Method: Uses hyperplane-based LSH to partition the corpus into hierarchical graphs, enabling localized updates without retraining.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in update time and token use while maintaining high accuracy and low latency.

Conclusion: EraRAG bridges the gap between retrieval efficiency and adaptability for growing corpora, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances large
language models (LLMs) by structuring retrieval over an external corpus.
However, existing approaches typically assume a static corpus, requiring
expensive full-graph reconstruction whenever new documents arrive, limiting
their scalability in dynamic, evolving environments. To address these
limitations, we introduce EraRAG, a novel multi-layered Graph-RAG framework
that supports efficient and scalable dynamic updates. Our method leverages
hyperplane-based Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to partition and organize the
original corpus into hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and
localized insertions of new data without disrupting the existing topology. The
design eliminates the need for retraining or costly recomputation while
preserving high retrieval accuracy and low latency. Experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that EraRag achieves up to an order of magnitude
reduction in update time and token consumption compared to existing Graph-RAG
systems, while providing superior accuracy performance. This work offers a
practical path forward for RAG systems that must operate over continually
growing corpora, bridging the gap between retrieval efficiency and
adaptability. Our code and data are available at

*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for using spiking neural networks (SNNs) in SAR interferometric phase unwrapping, addressing a gap in current methods and highlighting energy efficiency benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of Earth observation data (e.g., NISAR's 100PB in two years) necessitates energy-efficient processing. SNNs' event-driven model offers significant energy savings (30-100x) while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors develop spike encoding for wrapped phase data, propose SNN architectures leveraging spatial propagation, and analyze computational complexity and convergence.

Result: The framework shows SNNs' temporal dynamics can model spatial continuity in phase unwrapping, maintaining accuracy with energy savings.

Conclusion: This work pioneers SNNs in SAR interferometry, offering a sustainable alternative for large-scale InSAR processing and opening new research avenues.

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing quantum spiking models, such as reliance on classical memory and backpropagation, by leveraging quantum advantages for efficient, scalable, and trainable spiking neural networks.

Method: Develops the SQS neuron using multi-qubit quantum circuits for event-driven probabilistic spike generation and introduces SQSNNs with a local learning rule to avoid classical backpropagation.

Result: The SQS neuron enables single-shot spike generation with internal quantum memory, and SQSNNs combine neuromorphic efficiency with quantum state space.

Conclusion: The SQSNN model advances quantum spiking neural networks by integrating neuromorphic and quantum computing, offering modularity, scalability, and quantum-hardware trainability.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate experimental data with scientific theory for understanding, validating, and predicting complex system dynamics.

Method: A neural network maps noise to parameters, uses them in known equations to generate fake accelerations, compares with real data via MSE loss, and validates with a discriminator network.

Result: Accurate parameter estimation and model validation demonstrated for nonlinear structural systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines generative modeling and validation for robust system identification.

Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for
integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate,
and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new
method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification,
and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks,
a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These
parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake
accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error
loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent
validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are
evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is
real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real
experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for
different nonlinear structural systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using PDE discovery to bridge gaps between scales in biological systems, testing five methods on calcium diffusion simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems are complex, non-linear, and multi-scale, making behavior characterization difficult. PDE discovery can help link micro-scale data to macro-scale dynamics.

Method: Combines particle-based simulations with PDE discovery, evaluating five methods on calcium diffusion in astrocytes.

Result: Several methods accurately recovered the diffusion term, demonstrating PDE discovery's potential for capturing macro-scale dynamics from micro-scale data.

Conclusion: PDE discovery is promising for understanding multi-scale biological dynamics, though further validation is needed.

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the
physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes
the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their
activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that
require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging
gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)
discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from
micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining
particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary
experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate
five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of
calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated
on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal
variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods
accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE
discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R.
Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and
Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the

Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of

*Tongtong Liang,Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the implicit bias of flatness in overparameterized ReLU networks, showing that while flat solutions generalize, their convergence rates worsen exponentially with input dimension, unlike low-norm solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training, the study addresses gaps in existing work, which either requires interpolation or focuses on univariate inputs.

Method: Theoretical analysis is conducted for multivariate inputs, focusing on two settings: generalization gap for flat solutions and MSE in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima. Upper and lower bounds are derived.

Result: Flat solutions generalize but suffer exponential deterioration in convergence rates as input dimension grows, contrasting low-norm solutions. A novel packing argument reveals neural shattering as a cause.

Conclusion: Flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions due to neural shattering, a finding supported by simulations and providing the first systematic explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects
on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with
multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and
edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either
requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper
presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate
inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and
(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable
minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness
does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily
deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an
exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm
solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a
novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat
solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely
activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in
high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high
dimensions.

TL;DR: A novel VAE architecture using a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution is proposed, offering better hyperspherical representation and stability compared to Gaussian or von Mises-Fisher distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional latent distributions like Gaussian or vMF have limitations in capturing directional data and suffer from numerical instabilities. spCauchy addresses these issues.

Method: The method employs spCauchy for latent variables, leveraging its heavy-tailed nature and Möbius transformations for stable training. KL divergence is computed via a power series.

Result: spCauchy provides a more expressive and stable latent representation, avoiding over-regularization and numerical issues.

Conclusion: spCauchy is a superior alternative for VAEs, combining theoretical benefits with practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a
spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian
latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy
provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables,
better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its
heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent
space utilization while offering a more expressive representation.
Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF,
which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions.
Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization
trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training.
The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series,
eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of
ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling
alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical
efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.

### [274] [Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20933)
*Erik Jahn,Frederick Eberhardt,Leonard J. Schulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper shows that relaxing assumptions (acyclicity, causal sufficiency, uniform prior) leads to exponentially large Markov equivalence classes in causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limits of causal discovery from observational data when key assumptions are relaxed.

Method: Proves lower bounds for expected size of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random DAGs, acyclic mixed graphs, and cyclic graphs.

Result: Exponentially large equivalence classes are proven in all three relaxed settings.

Conclusion: Relaxing assumptions in causal discovery significantly increases the size of Markov equivalence classes, limiting identifiability.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their
Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be
learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under
the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior,
Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we
show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed.
Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size
of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic
graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random
directed cyclic graphs.

### [275] [Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20935)
*Hsin-Hsiung Huang,Hayden Hampton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid model combining Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), improves long-horizon geopolitical conflict forecasting by addressing data sparsity and burstiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep learning models like TFT struggle with unreliable predictions due to sparse, bursty, and overdispersed event data (e.g., GDELT).

Method: A two-stage approach: TFT generates multi-quantile forecasts, then VNNGP performs spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Outperforms standalone TFT in predicting timing/magnitude of bursty events, especially at long-range horizons (validated in Middle East and U.S. case studies).

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for reliable intelligence from event data, with publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database
of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national
security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data
cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP,
a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD)
competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our
model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal
dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as
informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP),
which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty
quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle
East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT,
showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event
periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust
framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from
challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to
ensure reproducibility.

*Yann Kerzreho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new method approximates RL agents' learning dynamics in Markov games by rescaling the learning process, leading to a deterministic ODE approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a tractable approximation of learning dynamics for multiple RL agents in Markov games.

Method: Rescale learning by reducing the learning rate and increasing update frequency, treating agent parameters as slow-evolving variables.

Result: Convergence to a deterministic ODE under ergodicity and continuity assumptions.

Conclusion: The rescaled process offers a practical approximation for RL agents' learning dynamics in Markov games.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics
of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state
Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously
reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively
treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the
fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process
and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process
to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable,
deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation
of the framework is available at\,:

### [277] [Wild refitting for black box prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21460)
*Martin J. Wainwright*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A computationally efficient refitting procedure, called wild refitting, is proposed to compute high-probability upper bounds on prediction error for penalized nonparametric estimates. It involves residual computation, symmetrization, and solving a modified prediction problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a practical and theoretically sound method for bounding prediction error in nonparametric estimation, addressing noise heterogeneity and requiring only a single dataset.

Method: The procedure involves three steps: computing residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a factor ρ, and solving a modified prediction problem. It uses Rademacher residual symmetrization (wild bootstrap variant).

Result: The method provides high-probability guarantees on prediction error bounds under mild conditions, with guidance on residual formation, noise rescaling, and stability.

Conclusion: Wild refitting is a versatile and theoretically grounded approach for bounding prediction error, applicable to diverse problems like image restoration and kernel methods.

Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for
computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared
prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares
minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the
prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals,
symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to
define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current
estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual
symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions
allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on
its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise
scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical
analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how
the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild
sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the
block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to
various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with
structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural
network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian-invariant versions of RWM, MALA, and second-order MALA, showing improved efficiency due to exact solutions for Gaussian targets, with applications in high-dimensional latent Gaussian models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the statistical efficiency of ergodic estimators by leveraging Gaussian invariance, which simplifies the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets.

Method: Develops Gaussian-invariant RWM, MALA, and second-order MALA, using exact solutions to construct control variates for variance reduction.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional latent Gaussian models and provides theoretical insights on geometric ergodicity and optimal scaling.

Conclusion: Gaussian-invariant sampling methods offer improved efficiency and practical utility, especially for intractable targets, with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of
random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and
second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show
that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved
statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian
invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson
equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct
efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators
under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in
several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models
where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art
results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity,
and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal
acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.

*He Li,Haoang Chi,Mingyu Liu,Wanrong Huang,Liyang Xu,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A novel Transformer-based framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes, outperforming classical methods in performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual outcome estimation with spatial-temporal attributes are limited in performance and generalization, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes a Transformer-based framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes, ensuring consistency and asymptotic normality under mild assumptions.

Result: Simulation and real data experiments confirm superior estimation capability and provide insights into the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in Colombia.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong estimation ability and practical utility, validated by experiments and real-world application.

Abstract: The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores controlling and optimizing coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, linking neural networks to PDEs and proposing a dual system formulation for efficient numerical schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored problem of optimizing and controlling coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators, especially in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.

Method: Proposes interpreting neural networks as PDEs, reformulating control problems from ODEs to PDEs, and introduces a dual system formulation for parabolic PDEs. Theoretical proofs for minimizers and solutions for hyperbolic PDEs are provided.

Result: Theoretical proof of minimizers for parabolic PDEs and existence of solutions for approximated hyperbolic PDE control problems.

Conclusion: The work initiates research on controlling PDE coefficients, offering a novel perspective on neural networks and laying groundwork for future numerical schemes.

Abstract: Although there is a substantial body of literature on control and
optimization problems for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, the specific
problem of controlling and optimizing the coefficients of the associated
operators within such systems has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
work, we aim to initiate a line of research in control theory focused on
optimizing and controlling the coefficients of these operators-a problem that
naturally arises in the context of neural networks and supervised learning.
  In supervised learning, the primary objective is to transport initial data
toward target data through the layers of a neural network. We propose a novel
perspective: neural networks can be interpreted as partial differential
equations (PDEs). From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally
studied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is
reformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the
optimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.
To the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been
systematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.
  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and
optimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for
the development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also
provide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem
for parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control
problem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions
for a corresponding approximated control problem.

TL;DR: The paper improves value-iteration algorithms for multichain MDPs under the average-reward criterion, addressing navigational subproblems and achieving faster convergence with novel theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the theoretical challenges of multichain MDPs, where optimal policies must navigate between connected components while optimizing long-run performance, a problem exacerbated by non-contractivity and non-unique Bellman solutions.

Method: The authors develop algorithms that better solve the navigational subproblem, leveraging connections between average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods, and refined suboptimality decompositions.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve improved convergence rates and sharper complexity measures compared to prior work, with novel theoretical contributions applicable to both discounted and average-reward problems.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical foundations of value-iteration approaches, offering faster convergence and broader applicability in solving multichain MDPs.

Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a.
multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward
criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the
difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of
contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the
multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of
steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing
long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better
solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for
multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures
of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of
potential independent interest, including novel connections between
average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for
discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence
rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions
for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for
discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations
of VI approaches.

*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: IMC-PINN-FE integrates physics-informed neural networks with finite element modeling for faster, more accurate patient-specific cardiac biomechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FE methods are slow and inaccurate for cardiac motion analysis, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Combines imaged motion consistency (IMC) with PINN and FE modeling to estimate myocardial stiffness and active tension rapidly.

Result: Achieves 75x speedup, improves motion accuracy (Dice from 0.849 to 0.927), and preserves realistic pressure-volume behavior.

Conclusion: IMC-PINN-FE provides a robust, efficient, and patient-specific solution for cardiac biomechanical modeling.

Abstract: Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for
understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical
imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However,
conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to
reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)
with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.
Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a
pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized
network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly
estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure
measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to
traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling
across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches
imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to
0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE
advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material
properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to
reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves
patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for
rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of Arabic dialect recognition due to linguistic diversity and scarce annotated datasets, especially for underrepresented dialects.

Method: Developed two hybrid models: (1) MFCC + CNN and (2) DWT + RNN, trained on a dialect-filtered subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset.

Result: MFCC + CNN achieved 91.2% accuracy, significantly outperforming DWT + RNN (66.5%). Spectral features with CNNs proved more effective.

Conclusion: The study establishes a baseline for Arabic dialect recognition in low-resource settings, recommending larger datasets, self-supervised learning, and advanced architectures like Transformers for future work.

Abstract: Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech
technology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large
annotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research
investigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal
processing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem
in low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered
subset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based
on speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN
architecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and
strong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the
Wavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These
findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with
convolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working
with limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to
dataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,
providing a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further
improvement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of
self-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural
architectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong
baseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a submission system for DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4, enhancing audio-tagging models with additional features, label correction, and dataset refinement to improve classification accuracy and CA-SDRi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed audio contains subtle cues missed by mel-spectrograms alone, requiring additional features and corrections for better performance.

Method: Incorporates spectral roll-off and chroma features, applies agent-based label correction, and refines the training dataset by removing irrelevant samples and adding external data.

Result: The system improves CA-SDRi by up to 14.7% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively enhance audio-tagging performance and classification accuracy in complex sound scenes.

Abstract: This technical report presents submission systems for Task 4 of the DCASE
2025 Challenge. This model incorporates additional audio features (spectral
roll-off and chroma features) into the embedding feature extracted from the
mel-spectral feature to im-prove the classification capabilities of an
audio-tagging model in the spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5)
system. This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains
subtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,
these additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.
Second, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs
processed by the S5 system. This system reduces false positives, improving the
final class-aware signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (CA-SDRi) metric.
Finally, we refine the training dataset to enhance the classi-fication accuracy
of low-performing classes by removing irrele-vant samples and incorporating
external data. That is, audio mix-tures are generated from a limited number of
data points; thus, even a small number of out-of-class data points could
degrade model performance. The experiments demonstrate that the submit-ted
systems employing these approaches relatively improve CA-SDRi by up to 14.7%
compared to the baseline of DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 4.

TL;DR: ThinkSound is a novel framework using Chain-of-Thought reasoning for high-fidelity video-to-audio generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing authentic audio from videos requires nuanced reasoning about visual dynamics and acoustic environments, which current methods struggle with.

Method: ThinkSound decomposes the process into three stages: foundational foley generation, interactive refinement, and targeted editing, guided by multimodal CoT reasoning.

Result: ThinkSound achieves top performance in video-to-audio generation and excels in out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkSound advances video-to-audio generation by integrating structured reasoning and user interaction, setting a new standard for fidelity and adaptability.

Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing
high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content
remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such
generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual
dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present
\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for
videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:
foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,
interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and
targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a
multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning
that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce
\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning
annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual
descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both
audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio
benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Demo.github.io.

TL;DR: A program is proposed to automatically select the best reviewers for research papers by analyzing references, extracting keywords, and ranking authors based on metrics like h-index and citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of efficiently selecting expert reviewers for the growing volume of research papers across diverse fields.

Method: Analyze references, extract topic keywords, rank authors using metrics (h-index, i10-index, citations), and filter potential reviewers by checking co-authors and colleagues.

Result: The program identifies top authors (professors) as likely best referees for reviewing the paper.

Conclusion: Automated reviewer selection can improve the efficiency and accuracy of peer review in rapidly expanding research fields.

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences,
anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various
periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to
review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are
called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee
for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and
the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these
papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts
in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should
be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the
best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy
to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research
paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we
collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the
references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic
keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count
their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we
rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their
homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and
colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,
generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing texture synthesis methods lack global context and geometric understanding, leading to inconsistencies. VideoTex aims to solve this by integrating video generation techniques.

Method: VideoTex uses geometry-aware conditions and a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy to enhance texture synthesis, ensuring smooth transitions and occluded area generation.

Result: VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent textures.

Conclusion: VideoTex advances texture synthesis by combining video generation models with geometric awareness, enabling dynamic real-time applications.

Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed
viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and
geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation
models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent
videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless
texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both
spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates
geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures.
Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances
the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting
in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother
transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally
stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and
stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both
visual quality and temporal coherence.

TL;DR: Generative Blocks World enables interactive scene editing in generated images using 3D primitives, outperforming prior methods in fidelity and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interactivity and editability of generated scenes by representing them with flexible 3D primitives.

Method: Scenes are represented as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, edited, and then regenerated using a flow-based method conditioned on depth and texture hints.

Result: Outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: The method provides superior scene manipulation and image generation, preserving object identity and enabling accurate edits.

Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated
image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents
scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be
represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move
either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been
edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on
depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D
primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value
caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera
moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.

Method: Uses template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for deformable hair geometry, a dual-GAN architecture, and cross-attention for hair-face correlation.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in unconditional full-head synthesis and composable hairstyle editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 3DGH successfully separates hair and face modeling, enabling flexible and high-quality 3D human head generation.

Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with
composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the
modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data
representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable
hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across
different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D
GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention
mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is
trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to
stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive
experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both
qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D
GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image
synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available

### [290] [FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272)
*Jiayi Zheng,Xiaodong Cun*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FairyGen generates story-driven cartoon videos from a child's drawing, preserving artistic style through character modeling, stylized backgrounds, and cinematic shot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create personalized, engaging animations while preserving the unique style of a child's drawing, addressing limitations in character consistency and motion in prior methods.

Method: Uses an MLLM for storyboard generation, style propagation for visual consistency, a shot design module for cinematic quality, and a two-stage motion customization adapter for animation.

Result: Produces stylistically faithful, narratively structured animations with natural motion.

Conclusion: FairyGen offers a promising approach for personalized story animation, combining style preservation and expressive storytelling.

Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

*Yatong Bai,Jonah Casebeer,Somayeh Sojoudi,Nicholas J. Bryan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DRAGON is a flexible framework for fine-tuning media generation models using diverse reward functions, outperforming traditional methods like RLHF and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning and preference-based methods by enabling optimization with a broader range of reward functions.

Method: DRAGON uses contrastive learning between positive and negative demonstration sets, leveraging cross-modality encoders and exemplar distributions.

Result: Achieves an 81.45% average win rate across 20 reward functions and a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate.

Conclusion: DRAGON offers a novel and effective approach to optimizing reward functions for improved human-perceived quality in media generation.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a
versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired
outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization
(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate
either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with
a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and
distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct
novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples
to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP
are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text
versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores
them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and
leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For
evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20
different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP
score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare
instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple
FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an
81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets
indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an
appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality
win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON
exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for
improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at

### [292] [Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298)
*Atharva Mehta,Shivam Chauhan,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores adapter configurations for fine-tuning music generation models (MusicGen and Mustango) on low-resource genres, revealing trade-offs between convolution-based and transformer-based adapters and comparing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify optimal adapter designs for efficient fine-tuning of large-scale music generation models on low-resource genres, addressing the high computational costs and unclear design choices.

Method: Studied various adapter configurations (architecture, placement, size) for MusicGen and Mustango on Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, analyzing performance and computational requirements.

Result: Convolution-based adapters capture local musical details better, while transformer-based adapters preserve long-range dependencies. Mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) balance expressivity and quality. Mustango offers diverse outputs but lacks stability; MusicGen is faster and more efficient.

Conclusion: Adapter design impacts performance; mid-sized adapters are optimal. Mustango excels in diversity but is resource-heavy, while MusicGen is efficient but slightly redundant.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and
Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to
billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based
methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with
minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the
design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,
are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce
optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this
paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter
configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:
Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in
capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short
melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range
dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze
computational resource requirements across different adapter scales,
demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal
balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a
diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to
the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in
notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive
and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive
models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can
produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher
redundancy in their generations.

TL;DR: The paper explores hierarchical classification for detecting instrument activities in music, addressing data scarcity for fine-grained annotations, and evaluates methods using the MedleyDB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve instrument recognition in music, especially for classes with limited data, by leveraging hierarchical classification inspired by Hornbostel-Sachs.

Method: Proposes hierarchical classification strategies and tests new models for hierarchical music prediction, evaluated on the diverse MedleyDB dataset.

Result: Demonstrates reliable coarse-level instrument detection, bridging fine-grained and group-level recognition.

Conclusion: Hierarchical classification enhances instrument activity detection, offering a pathway for future advancements in music information retrieval.

Abstract: Identifying instrument activities within audio excerpts is vital in music
information retrieval, with significant implications for music cataloging and
discovery. Prior deep learning endeavors in musical instrument recognition have
predominantly emphasized instrument classes with ample data availability.
Recent studies have demonstrated the applicability of hierarchical
classification in detecting instrument activities in orchestral music, even
with limited fine-grained annotations at the instrument level. Based on the
Hornbostel-Sachs classification, such a hierarchical classification system is
evaluated using the MedleyDB dataset, renowned for its diversity and richness
concerning various instruments and music genres. This work presents various
strategies to integrate hierarchical structures into models and tests a new
class of models for hierarchical music prediction. This study showcases more
reliable coarse-level instrument detection by bridging the gap between detailed
instrument identification and group-level recognition, paving the way for
further advancements in this domain.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and a bimodal-feature-fusion deep CNN (BMCNN) for modeling vehicular noise-speed coupling, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable transparent, reproducible research in urban noise monitoring and improve traffic management through acoustics-based speed classification.

Method: Proposes BMCNN with adaptive denoising, MFCC and wavelet-packet feature extraction, and cross-modal attention fusion.

Result: BMCNN achieves 87.56% accuracy on SZUR-Acoustic and 96.28% on IDMT-Traffic datasets, with validated module contributions.

Conclusion: The method supports smart-city traffic management for noise monitoring, speed estimation, and sustainable urban planning.

Abstract: This study presents and publicly releases the Suzhou Urban Road Acoustic
Dataset (SZUR-Acoustic Dataset), which is accompanied by comprehensive
data-acquisition protocols and annotation guidelines to ensure transparency and
reproducibility of the experimental workflow. To model the coupling between
vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep
convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive
denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental
background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,
which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the
intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.
Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy
of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic
dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further
validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and
overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification
method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for
real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic
flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable
urban planning.

### [295] [SmoothSinger: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Singing Voice Synthesis with Multi-Resolution Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21478)
*Kehan Sui,Jinxu Xiang,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SmoothSinger is a diffusion-based model for singing voice synthesis that refines low-quality audio directly, avoiding artifacts from two-stage pipelines. It uses a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and a modified U-Net for better pitch and spectral modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based SVS methods struggle with artifacts and naturalness due to complex singing characteristics and reliance on vocoders. SmoothSinger aims to address these issues.

Method: Proposes a conditional diffusion model with a reference-guided dual-branch architecture and a parallel low-frequency upsampling path in U-Net. Uses degraded ground truth audio for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Opencpop dataset, reducing artifacts and improving naturalness.

Conclusion: SmoothSinger effectively synthesizes high-quality, natural singing voices by refining audio directly and enhancing pitch and spectral modeling.

Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive and high-quality
vocals from musical scores, requiring precise modeling of pitch, duration, and
articulation. While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in
image and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to
the complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in
artifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a
conditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural
singing voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage
and often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized
audio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated
with two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch
architecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference
to guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware
synthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel
low-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch
contours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during
training, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,
addressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals. Experiments
on the Opencpop dataset, a large-scale Chinese singing corpus, demonstrate that
SmoothSinger achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective
evaluations. Extensive ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing
artifacts and improving the naturalness of synthesized voices.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A differentiable STFT is proposed for gradient-based optimization of parameters, improving time-frequency representation and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional STFT parameter tuning is manual or heuristic, leading to suboptimal results and computational inefficiency.

Method: A unified differentiable STFT formulation enables gradient-based optimization of parameters, integrating with neural networks for joint optimization.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real-world data show improved TFRs and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The differentiable STFT offers a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional parameter tuning methods.

Abstract: The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is widely used for analyzing
non-stationary signals. However, its performance is highly sensitive to its
parameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of
the STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This
approach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning
methods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It
enables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any
desired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural
networks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network
weights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and
improving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments
on both simulated and real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions in structural materials by integrating data and quantifying uncertainties.

Method: Uses a mixed density network (MDN) trained on experimental data to predict dislocation density and stress distributions, incorporated into a dislocation-mediated plasticity model.

Result: Accurate stress-strain predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification, aiding in alloy design optimization.

Conclusion: The methodology improves material property predictions and supports the development of new materials in the industry.

Abstract: Machine learning has significantly advanced the understanding and application
of structural materials, with an increasing emphasis on integrating existing
data and quantifying uncertainties in predictive modeling. This study presents
a comprehensive methodology utilizing a mixed density network (MDN) model,
trained on extensive experimental data from literature. This approach uniquely
predicts the distribution of dislocation density, inferred as a latent
variable, and the resulting stress distribution at the grain level. The
incorporation of statistical parameters of those predicted distributions into a
dislocation-mediated plasticity model allows for accurate stress-strain
predictions with explicit uncertainty quantification. This strategy not only
improves the accuracy and reliability of mechanical property predictions but
also plays a vital role in optimizing alloy design, thereby facilitating the
development of new materials in a rapidly evolving industry.

*Jingshu Li,Zicheng Zhu,Renwen Zhang,Yi-Chieh Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how chatbot anthropomorphism (human-like identity, emotional expression) influences human empathy and prosocial behaviors toward chatbots, finding empathy mediates these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors motivating people to help chatbots, leveraging the CASA framework.

Method: Online experiment (N=244) where chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative task, measuring prosocial behaviors/intentions.

Result: Human identity and emotional expression in chatbots increased prosocial behavior/intention, mediated by empathy. Qualitative analysis revealed empathy and human-like perception as motivations.

Conclusion: Chatbot anthropomorphism enhances human empathy and prosocial behaviors, offering insights for promoting human-chatbot collaboration.

Abstract: Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used
to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse
direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better
chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,
little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.
To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)
framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like
identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human
empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and
intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial
behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which
chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the
reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and
intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and
emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and
intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative
analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial
behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We
discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human
prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.

Motivation: To build on prior work and provide a foundation for future co-creative systems by identifying key design dimensions and considerations.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems across various applications like visual arts and writing.

Result: Identified key design dimensions (e.g., user control, proactive behavior) and 24 design considerations. High user control boosts satisfaction, while adaptive proactive systems enhance collaboration.

Conclusion: Co-creative systems benefit from high user control and adaptive proactive behavior, but gaps in early-phase support and user adaptation need addressing.

Abstract: The co creativity community is making significant progress in developing more
sophisticated and tailored systems to support and enhance human creativity.
Design considerations from prior work can serve as a valuable and efficient
foundation for future systems. To support this effort, we conducted a
systematic literature review of 62 papers on co-creative systems. These papers
cover a diverse range of applications, including visual arts, design, and
writing, where the AI acts not just as a tool but as an active collaborator in
the creative process. From this review, we identified several key dimensions
relevant to system design: phase of the creative process, creative task,
proactive behavior of the system, user control, system embodiment, and AI model
type. Our findings suggest that systems offering high user control lead to
greater satisfaction, trust, and a stronger sense of ownership over creative
outcomes. Furthermore, proactive systems, when adaptive and context sensitive,
can enhance collaboration. We also extracted 24 design considerations,
highlighting the value of encouraging users to externalize their thoughts and
of increasing the system's social presence and transparency to foster trust.
Despite recent advancements, important gaps remain, such as limited support for
early creative phases like problem clarification, and challenges related to
user adaptation to AI systems.

Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with visualization comprehension due to their inability to decode data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information.

Method: The approach trains multimodal visualization LLMs using chart images paired with vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses visualization understanding challenges by leveraging structured vector formats and multimodal training.

Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them
requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data
relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural

decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To
address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal
visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach
combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations,

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RASH, a contrastive learning framework for modeling heterophily in heterogeneous graphs, addressing challenges of node/edge heterogeneity and heterophily.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is under-explored, and existing methods lose potential heterophily by converting graphs to homogeneous ones.

Method: RASH uses dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs, dynamically constructs homophilic/heterophilic graphs, and employs multi-relation contrastive loss.

Result: RASH effectively addresses heterogeneity and heterophily, outperforming benchmarks in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: RASH successfully models heterophily in heterogeneous graphs, offering a robust solution for complex network analysis.

Abstract: Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the
connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This
heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but
remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types
of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very
challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be
carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert
heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which
will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous
relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of
Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that
explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and
adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH
introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite
subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs
based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to
align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual
information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of
heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various
downstream tasks. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs in NIDS face performance issues due to distribution drift and lack robustness against realistic adversarial attacks, with current evaluations relying on unrealistic synthetic perturbations.

Method: The approach integrates LLMs as simulated cybersecurity expert agents to analyze and mitigate adversarial perturbations in graph structures derived from network flow data before GNN processing.

Result: Experiments show LLM integration significantly improves GNN-based NIDS resilience against adversarial challenges, using a realistic evaluation framework.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures, enhancing GNN robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion
Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer
performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against
realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on
unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic
analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both
black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to
enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These
agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying
and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements
before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for
realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks
including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate
that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of
GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a
complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.

TL;DR: ZKPROV is a cryptographic framework for zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance, ensuring model integrity without revealing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM provenance integrity in sensitive domains like healthcare, where dataset usage is strictly regulated.

Method: Uses zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically bind models to authorized datasets, avoiding full training verification.

Result: Efficient, scalable proof generation and verification with formal security guarantees.

Conclusion: ZKPROV offers a practical, privacy-preserving solution for verifying LLM dataset provenance.

Abstract: As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) grows in sensitive domains,
ensuring the integrity of their computational provenance becomes a critical
challenge, particularly in regulated sectors such as healthcare, where strict
requirements are applied in dataset usage. We introduce ZKPROV, a novel
cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.
It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without
revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior
approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process
(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution
environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically
binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through
zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By
leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments,
ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the
LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the
ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical
solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security
guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while
ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.

Result: Achieves up to 98.70% F1 Score, with strong resistance to adversarial attacks like injection.

Conclusion: PhishKey is effective, adaptable, and robust for phishing detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat, evolving rapidly to
bypass detection mechanisms and exploit human vulnerabilities. This paper
introduces PhishKey to address the challenges of adaptability, robustness, and
efficiency. PhishKey is a novel phishing detection method using automatic
feature extraction from hybrid sources. PhishKey combines character-level
processing with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for URL classification, and
a Centroid-Based Key Component Phishing Extractor (CAPE) for HTML content at
the word level. CAPE reduces noise and ensures complete sample processing
avoiding crop operations on the input data. The predictions from both modules
are integrated using a soft-voting ensemble to achieve more accurate and
reliable classifications. Experimental evaluations on four state-of-the-art
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PhishKey. It achieves up to 98.70% F1
Score and shows strong resistance to adversarial manipulations such as
injection attacks with minimal performance degradation.

*Osama Zafar,Rosemarie Santa González,Mina Namazi,Alfonso Morales,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving framework for data-driven agriculture combines dimensionality reduction and differential privacy to enable secure data sharing and collaboration, addressing farmers' privacy concerns while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers hesitate to share agricultural data due to privacy risks like adverse pricing and discrimination, hindering the potential benefits of data-driven agriculture.

Method: The framework uses PCA and Laplacian noise for dimensionality reduction and differential privacy, enabling secure collaboration via federated learning or aggregated data.

Result: Validated on real datasets, the framework provides robust privacy protection against attacks and maintains utility comparable to centralized systems.

Conclusion: The framework fosters secure collaboration in agriculture, supporting innovation and sustainability by responsibly leveraging data.

Abstract: Data-driven agriculture, which integrates technology and data into
agricultural practices, has the potential to improve crop yield, disease
resilience, and long-term soil health. However, privacy concerns, such as
adverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from
sharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we
propose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and
collaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian
noise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows
researchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train
personalized machine learning models either on the data of identified
collaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated
privacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential
collaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life
datasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks
and utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how
this framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers
pursue broader research objectives. The adoption of the framework can empower
researchers and policymakers to leverage agricultural data responsibly, paving
the way for transformative advances in data-driven agriculture. By addressing
critical privacy challenges, this work supports secure data integration,
fostering innovation and sustainability in agricultural systems.

### [306] [Global and Local Contrastive Learning for Joint Representations from Cardiac MRI and ECG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20683)
*Alexander Selivanov,Philip Müller,Özgün Turgut,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Daniel Rückert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PTACL is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating CMR data, improving cardiac diagnostics without new learnable weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG lacks functional cardiac measurements like ventricular volumes, while CMR is expensive. PTACL aims to bridge this gap by enriching ECG with CMR insights.

Method: PTACL uses global patient-level and local temporal-level contrastive losses to align ECG and CMR data, enhancing ECG representations.

Result: PTACL outperforms baselines in retrieving similar cardiac phenotypes and predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters.

Conclusion: PTACL enhances non-invasive cardiac diagnostics by integrating ECG and CMR data, offering a cost-effective alternative to CMR.

Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for
detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly
measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed
structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To
bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive
Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG
representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses
global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive
loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and
CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart
embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal
alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with
corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations
with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more
insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without
introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data
from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL
achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving
patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac
function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our
results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac
diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at:

*Racheal Mukisa,Arvind K. Bansal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model, U-R-Veda, enhances cardiac image segmentation by combining convolution, vision transformers, and attention mechanisms, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated, accurate cardiac image segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiac disorders, but existing methods lack precision.

Method: U-R-Veda integrates convolution transformations, vision transformers, residual links, channel-attention, spatial attention, and edge-detection skip-connections for CMR image segmentation.

Result: U-R-Veda achieves 95.2% accuracy (DSC metrics), outperforming other models, especially for right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium delineation.

Conclusion: The model significantly improves CMR image segmentation, aiding better medical image analysis for cardiac disorders.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a
transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of
cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of
cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and
automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution
transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and
spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an
accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships
using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and
spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep
embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies
important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge
information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces
information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model
significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for
improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module
(channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show
that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The
model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD
metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and
left-ventricle-myocardium.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates 3D US into liver tumour ablation, using 2D US-CT/MRI registration for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in tumour identification in US images hinder broader adoption of 3D US in therapeutic applications.

Method: Proposes a 2D US-CT/MRI registration approach leveraging 3D US as an intermediary, with multimodal visualization for verification.

Result: Achieved 2-4 mm landmark distance error, 0.22s runtime per image pair, and 40% error reduction with non-rigid registration.

Conclusion: The framework enhances 3D US's role in tumour ablation, showing potential for broader clinical use.

Abstract: 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has shown significant benefits in enhancing the
outcomes of percutaneous liver tumour ablation. Its clinical integration is
crucial for transitioning 3D US into the therapeutic domain. However,
challenges of tumour identification in US images continue to hinder its broader
adoption. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating 3D US into
the standard ablation workflow. We present a key component, a clinically viable
2D US-CT/MRI registration approach, leveraging 3D US as an intermediary to
reduce registration complexity. To facilitate efficient verification of the
registration workflow, we also propose an intuitive multimodal image
visualization technique. In our study, 2D US-CT/MRI registration achieved a
landmark distance error of approximately 2-4 mm with a runtime of 0.22s per
image pair. Additionally, non-rigid registration reduced the mean alignment
error by approximately 40% compared to rigid registration. Results demonstrated
the efficacy of the proposed 2D US-CT/MRI registration workflow. Our
integration framework advanced the capabilities of 3D US imaging in improving
percutaneous tumour ablation, demonstrating the potential to expand the
therapeutic role of 3D US in clinical interventions.

*Shuki Maruyama,Hidenori Takeshima*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using modeled spectra improves spectral analysis accuracy under B0 inhomogeneity, outperforming traditional methods like LCModel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spectral analysis accuracy in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity.

Method: Proposed a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra generated from B0 maps and metabolite ratios, evaluated against measured spectra.

Result: Modeled spectra closely matched measured spectra, reducing MSE by 49.89% and outperforming LCModel in MAPEs.

Conclusion: The deep learning model with modeled spectra improves spectral analysis accuracy, especially with increased training samples.

Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis
in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors
proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained
on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced
by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and
metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a
patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline
components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled
spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.
The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled
spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared
errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)
of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the
phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The
modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on
the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The
analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved
MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by
26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.
The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to
1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both
types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep
learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest
that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral
analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.

*Jing Yang,Qunliang Xing,Mai Xu,Minglang Qiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method to improve JPEG image quality by leveraging correlations in DCT coefficients, outperforming pixel-domain methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG compression introduces artifacts, and existing enhancement methods in the pixel domain are computationally expensive. Direct DCT-domain enhancement is promising but currently limited in performance.

Method: The AJQE method identifies and exploits two critical correlations in DCT coefficients, adapting pixel-domain models to the DCT domain for better efficiency.

Result: The method achieves a 0.35 dB PSNR improvement and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput compared to pixel-domain methods.

Conclusion: The AJQE method effectively enhances JPEG quality in the DCT domain, offering superior performance and reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by
quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably
introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement
methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational
costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT
domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods
often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two
critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images.
Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality
Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE
method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models
to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational
complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models
derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5%
increase in enhancement throughput on average.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores 3D MLLMs for Radiology Report Generation, focusing on design choices like visual input, projectors, LLMs, and fine-tuning. It introduces knowledge-based augmentation methods, achieving 2nd place in a challenge, and finds RRG performance is less dependent on LLM size but influenced by volume size and segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs for automating Radiology Report Generation (RRG) and improve performance using knowledge-based methods.

Method: The study evaluates visual input representation, projectors, LLMs, and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. It introduces two knowledge-based report augmentation methods.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge with a 10% improvement on the GREEN score. Findings show RRG performance is largely independent of LLM size but benefits from segmentation masks and is sensitive to volume size.

Conclusion: 3D MLLMs are effective for RRG, with performance influenced by design choices like volume size and segmentation masks, while LLM size has minimal impact under consistent training protocols.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to
automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically
investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input
representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning
techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based
report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up
to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our
results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely
independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show
that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT
was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a
segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is

### [313] [Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21499)
*Hojat Asgariandehkordi,Mostafa Sharifzadeh,Hassan Rivaz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A zero-shot denoising framework for low-angle CPWC ultrasound enhances contrast without training data by using self-supervised learning on disjoint angle subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPWC improves image quality but reduces frame rate and introduces blurring; compounded images are noisy with limited transmissions.

Method: Divides transmission angles into subsets to form noisy compound images, trains a lightweight deep model via self-supervised residual learning to suppress noise.

Result: Superior contrast enhancement and structure preservation compared to classical and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable, efficient, and effective for CPWC denoising without paired data or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by
combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the
number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the
frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.
Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when
acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot
denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances
contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the
available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form
compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are
then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,
enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical
structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while
the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows
the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the
consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no
domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across
anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports
efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight
architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on
simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement
and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based
denoising methods.

### [1] [Runtime Failure Hunting for Physics Engine Based Software Systems: How Far Can We Go?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22099)
*Shuqing Li,Qiang Chen,Xiaoxue Ren,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-scale study on physics failures in Physics Engines (PEs), addressing manifestations, detection methods, and developer insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics failures in PEs can compromise reliability and safety, but current testing methods are inadequate.

Method: Empirical study involving taxonomy creation, evaluation of detection techniques (deep learning, prompt-based, multimodal models), and developer feedback.

Result: A taxonomy of physics failures, effectiveness of detection methods, and developer insights for improving detection.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights and releases resources (PhysiXFails) to advance physics failure detection research.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at
https://sites.google.com/view/physics-failure-detection.

### [2] [Trade-offs in Image Generation: How Do Different Dimensions Interact?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22100)
*Sicheng Zhang,Binzhu Xie,Zhonghao Yan,Yuli Zhang,Donghao Zhou,Xiaofei Chen,Shi Qiu,Jiaqi Liu,Guoyang Xie,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRIG-Bench introduces a dataset and TRIGScore metric to analyze trade-offs in image generation across 10 dimensions, evaluating 14 models and proposing a Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) for comprehensive insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack exploration of complex trade-offs in image generation due to limited datasets and single-metric evaluations.

Method: Developed TRIG-Bench (40,200 samples, 10 dimensions) and TRIGScore (VLM-as-judge metric), evaluated 14 models, and proposed DTM for visualizing trade-offs.

Result: DTM provides insights into model-specific trade-offs, and fine-tuning on DTM can mitigate weaknesses.

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench and DTM offer a systematic way to understand and improve trade-offs in image generation models.

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

### [4] [Color as the Impetus: Transforming Few-Shot Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22136)
*Chaofei Qi,Zhitai Liu,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that mimics human color perception for few-shot learning, outperforming conventional methods by leveraging color-channel interactions and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by humans' innate meta-learning abilities, particularly their exceptional color perception, which is underutilized in existing few-shot learning approaches.

Method: The proposed ColorSense Learner uses inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning to emphasize color information, while the ColorSense Distiller employs knowledge distillation to enhance meta-learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on eleven benchmarks show the framework's strong generalization, robustness, and transferability in few-shot classification.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in meta-learning by integrating color perception, offering superior performance in few-shot tasks.

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

### [5] [Enhancing efficiency in paediatric brain tumour segmentation using a pathologically diverse single-center clinical dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22152)
*A. Piffer,J. A. Buchner,A. G. Gennari,P. Grehten,S. Sirin,E. Ross,I. Ezhov,M. Rosier,J. C. Peeken,M. Piraud,B. Menze,A. Guerreiro Stücklin,A. Jakab,F. Kofler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL-based segmentation for paediatric brain tumours shows robust performance for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity, comparable to human annotators, but struggles with enhancing tumour and cystic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the feasibility of deep learning for segmenting diverse paediatric brain tumour subtypes across varied MRI protocols.

Method: A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on a retrospective cohort of 174 patients with manual annotations for four tumour subregions, assessed using Dice similarity coefficient.

Result: Model achieved strong performance for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity (DSC: 0.85), comparable to human variability, but was less accurate for enhancing tumour (DSC: 0.75) and poor for cystic components.

Conclusion: DL is feasible for paediatric brain tumour segmentation, particularly for certain subregions, but requires refinement for others. Findings suggest potential for protocol simplification and workflow automation.

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

### [6] [Temporally Consistent Unsupervised Segmentation for Mobile Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22194)
*Christian Ellis,Maggie Wigness,Craig Lennon,Lance Fiondella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frontier-Seg is a method for temporally consistent unsupervised terrain segmentation in mobile robot video streams, addressing gaps in existing zero-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised semantic segmentation methods require costly labeled data and struggle in unrehearsed, unstructured environments where labels are unavailable or ambiguous.

Method: Frontier-Seg clusters superpixel-level features from DINOv2 foundation models and enforces temporal consistency to identify terrain boundaries without human supervision.

Result: Evaluated on RUGD and RELLIS-3D datasets, Frontier-Seg demonstrates effective unsupervised segmentation in unstructured off-road environments.

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg offers a robust, unsupervised solution for terrain segmentation, overcoming limitations of supervised and frame-by-frame zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

### [7] [SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22264)
*Shaoan Xie,Lingjing Kong,Yujia Zheng,Yu Yao,Zeyu Tang,Eric P. Xing,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses CLIP's limitations in handling misaligned and entangled image-text data by proposing a novel framework for flexible, granular alignment and disentanglement of visual and textual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with misaligned and entangled representations in image-text datasets, limiting its generalization on downstream tasks. The paper aims to improve alignment and disentanglement.

Method: The authors introduce a theoretical framework for flexible alignment and disentanglement, followed by a novel approach (SmartCLIP) that modularly aligns relevant visual and textual representations.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across tasks, effectively handling information misalignment and validating the theoretical conditions.

Conclusion: The framework and SmartCLIP successfully address CLIP's limitations, enabling better alignment and disentanglement for improved generalization.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

### [8] [HOG-CNN: Integrating Histogram of Oriented Gradients with Convolutional Neural Networks for Retinal Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22274)
*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HOG-CNN, a hybrid model combining HOG and CNN features for automated retinal disease detection, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual diagnosis of retinal diseases is time- and resource-intensive; automation can improve efficiency and accessibility.

Method: Integrates HOG (local texture) and CNN (high-level semantics) features into a hybrid model, evaluated on APTOS 2019, ORIGA, and IC-AMD datasets.

Result: High performance: 98.5% accuracy for binary DR, 94.2 AUC for multiclass DR, 92.8% accuracy for AMD, and 83.9% accuracy for Glaucoma.

Conclusion: HOG-CNN is robust, scalable, and suitable for resource-constrained settings, offering a promising tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaEarth Foundations introduces a geospatial embedding model that outperforms existing methods in mapping tasks without retraining, leveraging sparse labels for global-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality labels for Earth observation data drives the need for efficient, generalizable models to translate sparse labels into accurate maps.

Method: AlphaEarth Foundations uses an embedding field model to integrate spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts from multiple data sources.

Result: The model consistently outperforms previous featurization methods in diverse mapping evaluations and will release global embedding layers from 2017-2024.

Conclusion: AlphaEarth Foundations provides a scalable, high-performance solution for geospatial mapping and monitoring, addressing label scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

### [10] [LAMA-Net: A Convergent Network Architecture for Dual-Domain Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22316)
*Chi Ding,Qingchao Zhang,Ge Wang,Xiaojing Ye,Yunmei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAMA, a learnable variational model for image reconstruction, and its neural network version, LAMA-Net. It provides a convergence proof for LAMA, demonstrates stability and robustness of LAMA-Net, and introduces iLAMA-Net for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image reconstruction by leveraging features from both image and measurement domains, and to rigorously prove the convergence of the proposed LAMA algorithm.

Method: Proposes LAMA, a learned alternating minimization algorithm, and extends it to LAMA-Net, a neural network architecture. Introduces iLAMA-Net for better initialization.

Result: LAMA-Net shows outstanding stability and robustness, and iLAMA-Net further improves performance. Experiments on Sparse-View Computed Tomography datasets validate the approach.

Conclusion: LAMA and its variants (LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net) are effective for image reconstruction, with proven convergence and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

### [11] [Learning from Heterogeneous Structural MRI via Collaborative Domain Adaptation for Late-Life Depression Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22321)
*Yuzhen Gao,Qianqian Wang,Yongheng Sun,Cui Wang,Yongquan Liang,Mingxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Collaborative Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN is proposed for late-life depression (LLD) detection from T1-weighted MRIs, addressing domain heterogeneity and limited sample sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLD detection face challenges due to small sample sizes and domain heterogeneity in MRI data, limiting model reliability and generalization.

Method: The CDA framework combines ViT for global context and CNN for local features, involving supervised source training, self-supervised target adaptation, and collaborative training with pseudo-labels and augmentation.

Result: CDA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods on multi-site MRI data.

Conclusion: The proposed CDA framework effectively addresses domain heterogeneity and improves LLD detection accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

### [12] [UFV-Splatter: Pose-Free Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Adapted to Unfavorable Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22342)
*Yuki Fujimura,Takahiro Kushida,Kazuya Kitano,Takuya Funatomi,Yasuhiro Mukaigawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting framework is introduced to handle unfavorable input views by leveraging pretrained models and novel adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on favorable camera views, limiting real-world applicability. This work aims to overcome this by adapting models to handle varying and unknown poses.

Method: The framework uses pretrained models with LoRA layers, a Gaussian adapter module for geometric consistency, and a Gaussian alignment method for accurate rendering. Training leverages off-the-shelf datasets of favorable images.

Result: Experiments on synthetic (Google Scanned Objects) and real (OmniObject3D) datasets validate the method's effectiveness in handling unfavorable views.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extends the applicability of feed-forward 3DGS models to real-world scenarios with unknown camera poses.

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

### [13] [DeltaVLM: Interactive Remote Sensing Image Change Analysis via Instruction-guided Difference Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22346)
*Pei Deng,Wenqian Zhou,Hanlin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSICA, a new paradigm combining change detection and visual question answering for interactive analysis of bi-temporal remote sensing images, supported by the ChangeChat-105k dataset and the DeltaVLM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for land-cover change analysis are limited to static outputs, lacking interactive, query-driven capabilities.

Method: Proposes DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture with a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder, visual difference perception module, and instruction-guided Q-former, trained on the ChangeChat-105k dataset.

Result: DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis.

Conclusion: The RSICA paradigm and DeltaVLM model enable more flexible and accurate interactive change analysis in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large

efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset

### [14] [FaceGCD: Generalized Face Discovery via Dynamic Prefix Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22353)
*Yunseok Oh,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Face Discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face recognition task combining traditional identification with generalized category discovery (GCD). It proposes FaceGCD, a dynamic method using lightweight prefixes for feature extraction, outperforming existing GCD methods and ArcFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of recognizing both labeled and unlabeled known identities while discovering new ones in face recognition, advancing toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Method: FaceGCD dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using lightweight, layer-wise prefixes generated by a HyperNetwork, adapting to each input image.

Result: FaceGCD outperforms existing GCD methods and ArcFace, achieving state-of-the-art results on the GFD task.

Conclusion: FaceGCD advances open-world face recognition by effectively handling high cardinality and fine-grained face identities, setting a new benchmark for the GFD task.

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVD (Guiding Video Diffusion) is a diffusion-based video distillation method that efficiently captures spatial and temporal features, outperforming previous methods on MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets with minimal frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computation and storage demands of large video datasets while maintaining performance.

Method: Jointly distills spatial and temporal features using diffusion, ensuring high-fidelity video generation and motion capture.

Result: Achieves 78.29% performance with 1.98% frames in MiniUCF and 73.83% with 3.30% frames in HMDB51, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: GVD sets a new benchmark for video dataset distillation, enabling high-resolution and high-IPC video generation with low computational cost.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

*Anubhav Kataria,Surbhi Madan,Shreya Ghosh,Tom Gedeon,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMS introduces a multimodal framework for predicting fine-grained individual to coarse-grained group and event-level emotions, leveraging swin-transformer and S3Attention. It extends VGAF-GEMS for holistic analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multi-person social situations requires analyzing emotions at individual, group, and event levels with contextual information.

Method: GEMS uses a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention architecture to process scenes, groups, and context for joint emotion predictions.

Result: GEMS effectively predicts discrete/continuous emotions at individual, group, and event levels, demonstrating superior performance on VGAF-GEMS.

Conclusion: GEMS advances holistic emotion analysis, linking individual, group, and situational responses, and encourages further research.

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

*Jordan Vice,Naveed Akhtar,Yansong Gao,Richard Hartley,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are vulnerable to subtle frequency-domain perturbations, affecting tasks like DeepFake detection and captioning, revealing their fragility under realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in VLMs when exposed to structured frequency perturbations, challenging their reliability in critical tasks.

Method: Designed targeted frequency-domain image transformations to perturb VLM outputs, tested across five state-of-the-art VLMs and ten datasets.

Result: VLMs are sensitive to frequency cues, with outputs misaligned with semantic content, even under visually-imperceptible perturbations.

Conclusion: VLMs' reliability is questionable under adversarial conditions, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal perception systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

TL;DR: MINR combines implicit neural representations with masked image modeling for robust and generalizable image reconstructions, outperforming MAE in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods like MAE rely heavily on masking strategies and struggle with out-of-distribution data.

Method: MINR integrates implicit neural representations with masked image modeling to learn continuous image representations, improving robustness.

Result: MINR outperforms MAE in in-domain and out-of-distribution settings while reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: MINR is a versatile, robust, and efficient alternative to existing self-supervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

TL;DR: MZNet, a U-shaped network, effectively removes moiré patterns using multi-scale and multi-shape components, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moiré patterns hinder applications like photography and defect inspection. Existing CNN-based methods struggle due to limited receptive fields and diverse pattern characteristics.

Method: MZNet integrates Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block (MSDAB), Multi-Shape Large Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB), and Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection to address moiré patterns.

Result: MZNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and competitive results on lower-resolution ones, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MZNet is an efficient and practical solution for moiré pattern removal in real-world applications.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVScenes is a large-scale multi-modal UAV dataset addressing the lack of frame-wise annotations for high-level scene understanding tasks, enhancing MARS-LVIG with semantic labels and 6-DoF poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV datasets are biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction, lacking support for high-level tasks due to missing frame-wise annotations.

Method: Enhances MARS-LVIG dataset by adding manual semantic annotations for images and LiDAR point clouds, along with 6-DoF poses.

Result: Enables diverse UAV perception tasks like segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: UAVScenes fills a critical gap in multi-modal UAV perception, supporting advanced scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

*Phi Van Nguyen,Ngoc Huynh Trinh,Duy Minh Lam Nguyen,Phu Loc Nguyen,Quoc Long Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using conditional flow matching to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation, outperforming current diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation reflects natural variability among expert annotators, but current methods, including diffusion-based approaches, have limitations in accurately capturing this uncertainty.

Method: The method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model, to learn exact densities and produce accurate segmentation samples.

Result: The approach achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and generates reliable uncertainty maps, reflecting inter-annotator differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively quantifies uncertainty in ambiguous regions, offering deeper insights into segmentation reliability.

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline to enhance image-text pair quality, creating the VLM-150M dataset and HQ-CLIP model, which outperforms CLIP in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LVLMs can improve image-text pair data quality, enabling a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous enhancement.

Method: Leverages LVLMs to generate multi-grained textual annotations (positive/negative descriptions and tags) from raw data, then trains HQ-CLIP using these annotations in contrastive learning.

Result: HQ-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained tasks, surpassing CLIP even with less training data.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline and HQ-CLIP demonstrate the potential of LVLMs to refine data and improve model performance, enabling scalable and high-quality vision-language learning.

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

*Youngho Kim,Hoonhee Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel domain adaptation approach using event cameras to address motion blur in human pose estimation, outperforming conventional methods without requiring target domain annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur in low-light or rapid motion conditions degrades pose estimation, and existing datasets lack such scenarios. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and blur robustness.

Method: Leverages event-based augmentation to generate motion-aware blurred images and a student-teacher framework with mutual uncertainty masking for pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Outperforms traditional domain-adaptive methods, achieving robust pose estimation in blurred environments without annotated target data.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a scalable solution for domain adaptation in motion blur scenarios, with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods lack geometric realism and global topological consistency, limiting their effectiveness for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Proposes TopoLiDM, combining GNNs and diffusion models with topological regularization, using a VAE for latent graph extraction and PH constraints for topological adherence.

Result: Achieves 22.6% lower FRID and 9.2% lower MMD on KITTI-360, with fast generation speed (1.68 samples/s).

Conclusion: TopoLiDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering scalable, high-fidelity LiDAR generation for real-world applications.

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

*Zheng Xiangyu,He Songcheng,Li Wanyun,Li Xiaoqiang,Zhang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMHI-Net, a hierarchical memory architecture for UVOS, addressing the flaw of over-reliance on high-level features by incorporating both shallow- and high-level features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UVOS methods over-rely on high-level semantic features, lacking fine-grained details due to no prior annotations, leading to marginal performance gains.

Method: Proposes HMHI-Net with hierarchical memory and heterogeneous interaction (PLAM and SGIM modules) to integrate pixel and semantic information.

Result: HMHI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance across UVOS and video saliency benchmarks, demonstrating robustness with different backbones.

Conclusion: The hierarchical memory and heterogeneous interaction design effectively addresses the limitations of existing UVOS methods, proving superior and robust performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

### [30] [Visual Language Models as Zero-Shot Deepfake Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22469)
*Viacheslav Pirogov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VLM-based approach for deepfake detection, outperforming traditional methods in zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a growing threat, but existing detection methods lack robustness by focusing solely on image classification without auxiliary tasks.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot deepfake detection, tested on a 60,000-image dataset and DFDC-P.

Result: VLMs, especially InstructBLIP, outperform traditional classifiers in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a superior alternative to traditional deepfake detection methods, enhancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

*Hui Liu,Chen Jia,Fan Shi,Xu Cheng,Mengfei Shi,Xia Xie,Shengyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LIDAR, a lightweight network for efficient multimodal crack segmentation, outperforming SOTA methods with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of adaptive perception and efficient fusion of cross-modal features in existing crack segmentation methods.

Method: Uses LacaVSS for adaptive cue modeling and LD3CF for spatial/frequency-domain fusion, with LDMK convolution for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 0.8204 F1 and 0.8465 mIoU on a dataset with only 5.35M parameters.

Conclusion: LIDAR is effective for pixel-level crack segmentation with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CamFlow introduces a hybrid motion framework combining physical and stochastic bases for robust 2D camera motion estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods (homography-based or meshflow) are limited in handling complex non-linear transformations in 2D camera motion estimation.

Method: CamFlow uses hybrid motion bases (physical and stochastic) and a Laplace-based probabilistic loss for robust training.

Result: CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing superior robustness and generalization in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach of CamFlow effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

### [33] [Robust Adverse Weather Removal via Spectral-based Spatial Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22498)
*Yuhwan Jeong,Yunseo Yang,Youngjo Yoon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSGformer uses spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration, outperforming existing methods by handling localized distortions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather causes complex degradation patterns, and current All-in-One models struggle with diverse, localized distortions.

Method: SSGformer decomposes images into high/low-frequency features, uses multi-head linear attention, and introduces a grouping-mask with group-wise attention for restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments validate SSGformer's superiority in handling diverse adverse weather degradations.

Conclusion: SSGformer effectively addresses localized distortions in adverse weather conditions, offering robust and consistent performance.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

*Chang Huang,Jiahang Cao,Jun Ma,Kieren Yu,Cong Li,Huayong Yang,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A degradation-aware conditional diffusion model is proposed to enhance underwater images by predicting degradation levels and using adaptive noise scheduling and feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from color distortions and low visibility due to scattering and absorption, limiting their quality and downstream tasks. Existing methods fail to adapt to diverse degradation conditions or leverage underwater-specific priors effectively.

Method: The method uses a lightweight dual-stream network to predict degradation levels, then employs a conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet backbone, adaptive feature fusion, and a hybrid loss function.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, restoring images with superior color fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances underwater images by integrating degradation awareness and physical priors, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACTIVE, a large-scale dataset for natural human-robot interaction (N-HRI), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. It also proposes ACTIVE-PC, a method for accurate long-distance action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for human action recognition lack the flexibility and diversity needed for N-HRI, especially in mobile robot scenarios.

Method: The authors created the ACTIVE dataset with 30 action categories, 80 participants, and 46,868 annotated videos (RGB and point cloud). They also developed ACTIVE-PC, using advanced techniques like Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling and Elastic Ellipse Query.

Result: ACTIVE-PC effectively recognizes human actions at long distances, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Conclusion: The ACTIVE dataset and ACTIVE-PC method advance action recognition in N-HRI, providing a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our

TL;DR: A novel high-resolution video vasculature segmentation network (HRVVS) is proposed for hepatic vasculature segmentation in surgical videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The segmentation of hepatic vasculature in surgical videos is clinically significant but lacks research due to dataset scarcity and task complexity.

Method: HRVVS integrates a pretrained VAR model into a hierarchical encoder and uses a dynamic memory decoder in a multi-view segmentation network.

Result: HRVVS significantly outperforms existing methods on surgical video datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HRVVS is effective for hepatic vasculature segmentation, with the dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The
source code and dataset will be publicly available at

*Kiseong Hong,Gyeong-hyeon Kim,Eunwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel prompt-evolving mechanism improves continual learning by adaptively aggregating task-specific prompts, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based continual learning methods lack representational diversity due to fixed or entangled prompts.

Method: Proposes a prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts and a learnable probabilistic gate for layer activation.

Result: Achieves average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% in image classification and video action recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances prompt diversity and continual learning performance.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-phase framework for long-tailed breast lesion classification using generative augmentation and reinforcement learning to balance data distribution and maintain discriminative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes is crucial for personalized treatment, but skewed long-tailed data distribution challenges automated recognition.

Method: Proposes a dual-phase framework with reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampling and a class-controllable synthetic network using sketch-grounded perception.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance on long-tailed and imbalanced breast US datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates distributional bias and maintains discriminative capability, offering a viable solution for long-tailed classification in breast US.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOkeD introduces a heterogeneous ensemble method combining a closed-world classifier, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier for superior OOD detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of single-classifier OOD detection methods, which are constrained by their in-distribution performance. It proposes leveraging diverse classifiers to improve robustness.

Method: COOkeD combines a closed-world classifier, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP features. The approach is modular and post-hoc.

Result: COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance on benchmarks like CIFAR100 and ImageNet, even in challenging scenarios like label noise and covariate shift.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous ensemble approach (COOkeD) outperforms traditional and CLIP-based methods, offering robust and modular OOD detection with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring eKYC system reliability against deepfake attacks by detecting manipulated identities.

Method: Uses temporal inconsistencies in identity vectors, registered images for identity discrepancies, and a robust face feature extractor.

Result: Accurate detection of face swapping and reenactment, robust against image degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances deepfake detection for eKYC systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

TL;DR: ShortFT introduces an efficient fine-tuning strategy for diffusion models by using a shorter denoising chain, improving alignment with reward functions and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backpropagation-based approaches for aligning diffusion models with reward functions face computational costs and gradient explosion risks due to lengthy denoising chains, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: ShortFT employs a trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model to create a shorter denoising chain, optimizing fine-tuning efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: The method significantly improves alignment performance with various reward functions and outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: ShortFT offers a practical and efficient solution for fine-tuning diffusion models, enhancing their alignment with reward functions.

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Motivation: Existing models struggle with unstable performance in multimodal tasks due to their complexity and diversity.

Method: Uses Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) with dynamic difficulty adjustment and adaptive reward mechanisms.

Result: VL-Cogito outperforms existing models in multimodal benchmarks like math, science, and logic.

Conclusion: PCuRL effectively enhances multimodal reasoning, balancing efficiency and correctness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

*Daehee Park,Monu Surana,Pranav Desai,Ashish Mehta,Reuben MV John,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GALTraj improves trajectory prediction by using generative active learning to augment rare tail scenarios during training, enhancing performance on both tail and head samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of rarely observed long-tail scenarios in trajectory prediction without modifying model architectures.

Method: Introduces GALTraj, a generative active learning method that identifies and augments rare tail samples using a controllable diffusion model, ensuring diversity and realism.

Result: Significant performance boost on tail samples and improved accuracy on head samples across multiple datasets (WOMD, Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR).

Conclusion: GALTraj demonstrates the effectiveness of simulator-driven augmentation for long-tail learning in trajectory prediction, outperforming prior methods focused solely on diversity.

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unresolved challenges in tumor boundary segmentation and feature transfer with missing imaging modalities.

Method: Uses Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation, and a Global Style Matching Module.

Result: Outperforms leading methods on BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets in Dice and HD95 scores, especially with modality loss.

Conclusion: MST-KDNet is robust and generalizable, suitable for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation, particularly when dealing
with missing modalities, remains a critical challenge in medical image
analysis. Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor
boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key
imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing
these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge
Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions,
Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global
Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial
learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024
datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both
Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality
loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential,
making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications. Our

*Federico Girella,Davide Talon,Ziyue Liu,Zanxi Ruan,Yiming Wang,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOTS is a novel method for fashion image generation using localized sketches and text, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion design combines visual and textual elements, but existing methods lack fine-grained control. LOTS addresses this by integrating localized sketch-text pairs for detailed generation.

Method: LOTS uses a Modularized Pair-Centric representation for shared latent encoding and a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase for local-global conditioning in a diffusion model.

Result: LOTS outperforms existing methods on global and localized metrics, validated by the Sketchy dataset and human evaluation.

Conclusion: LOTS enables unprecedented customization in fashion image generation, setting a new benchmark for sketch-text based approaches.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

TL;DR: A dual-stream drone monitoring framework using YOLOv11n on RGB and IR data streams achieves real-time, accurate drone detection and payload classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security concerns from drone proliferation by improving real-time surveillance for drone detection, tracking, and payload identification.

Method: Independent YOLOv11n detectors on RGB and IR streams with domain-specific preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: High accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and payload classification, maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The dual-modality design and specialized training enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across diverse conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-guided data augmentation framework for 3D point cloud segmentation improves scene synthesis by enforcing local and global structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing augmentation methods lack global structural dependencies, limiting realistic scene synthesis.

Method: Proposes a framework with dual-level constraints (local geometric plausibility and global topological alignment) guided by learned object relationship statistics.

Result: Generates diverse, high-quality augmented scenes, improving segmentation performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances realism and performance in 3D point cloud segmentation by addressing structural dependencies.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using diffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), as universal perceptual templates for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging their denoising trajectories and Stein score errors for semantic anomaly detection without dataset-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety of vision systems in open-world environments by improving OOD detection using generative models as foundational tools.

Method: Utilizes DDMs' denoising trajectories and Stein score errors, amplified by SSIM, to detect anomalies without retraining on target datasets. Trains on CelebA as a base distribution.

Result: Achieves near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the effectiveness of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Generative foundation models, particularly DDMs, show strong potential for OOD detection, with room for further improvement in certain settings.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

### [52] [Image-Guided Shape-from-Template Using Mesh Inextensibility Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22699)
*Thuy Tran,Ruochen Chen,Shaifali Parashar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised Shape-from-Template (SfT) method using image features and constraints for faster, more accurate 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SfT relies on point correspondences, failing under occlusions, while modern methods need large supervised datasets. This work aims for unsupervised, efficient reconstruction.

Method: Uses color features, gradients, silhouettes, and mesh inextensibility constraints for unsupervised 3D reconstruction, avoiding correspondence or supervision needs.

Result: Achieves 400x faster reconstruction than best unsupervised SfT and better handles occlusions and fine details.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, unsupervised, and superior in handling occlusions and details, advancing SfT capabilities.

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, applicable to various camera types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms like the 5-point or 8-point methods are limited to synchronized views, failing for asynchronous data from rolling shutter or event cameras.

Method: Formulates the problem using first-order dynamics and a constant velocity model, deriving a linear point incidence relation for efficient recovery of linear velocity and 3D points.

Result: Validated on simulated and real-world data, showing consistent improvement over recent approaches across all sensing modalities.

Conclusion: The work enables efficient structure and motion estimation from asynchronous data, with potential applications in diverse camera systems.

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Result: Shows improvements over LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer models on synthetic and real datasets, and explores 2D vs. 3D poses and noisy pose effects.

Conclusion: Using body poses enhances trajectory prediction, with 'Social-pose' proving effective across datasets and applications like robot navigation.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves F1 score of 0.757; repurposed segmentation model improves to 0.771.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models like FetalCLIP can enhance prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of

quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal

Method: Integrates CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2, and ConvNeXt backbones, uses MoECs for dynamic expert selection, and employs Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) for efficient feature use.

Result: Outperforms open-weight models, e.g., 3.25% improvement in POPE and 153-point increase on MME.

Conclusion: MoCHA's MoECs and HGA modules are effective and robust, enhancing performance in visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

*Hossein Mirzaei,Zeinab Taghavi,Sepehr Rezaee,Masoud Hadi,Moein Madadi,Mackenzie W. Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy (DISTIL) is proposed to detect Trojan attacks in deep neural networks by using a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to Trojan attacks, posing safety risks in critical applications. Current trigger-inversion methods lack guarantees and rely on strong assumptions.

Method: DISTIL restricts the search space using a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier, iteratively generating candidate triggers aligned with the model's malicious behavior.

Result: DISTIL achieves up to 7.1% higher accuracy on BackdoorBench and 9.4% improvement in trojaned object detection model scanning.

Conclusion: DISTIL offers a reliable, data-free defense against backdoor attacks without relying on extensive data or strong trigger assumptions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

*Patryk Rygiel,Julian Suk,Christoph Brune,Kak Khee Yeung,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric deep learning model is proposed to estimate hemodynamic parameters in AAA patients, showing strong generalization across real-world variations like geometry changes and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations for AAA hemodynamics are computationally expensive, motivating the need for faster, deep learning-based alternatives.

Method: An E(3)-equivariant deep learning model uses robust geometrical descriptors and projective geometric algebra to estimate transient WSS from CT scans of 100 AAA patients.

Result: The model generalizes well within and outside the training distribution, handling geometry remodelling, boundary condition changes, and new artery branches. It is also mesh resolution-agnostic.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers accurate and generalizable hemodynamic parameter estimation, with potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

### [62] [Bi-Level Optimization for Self-Supervised AI-Generated Face Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22824)
*Mian Zou,Nan Zhong,Baosheng Yu,Yibing Zhan,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised method using bi-level optimization improves AI-generated face detection by pretraining on photographic images and optimizing pretext tasks. It outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning for AI-generated face detection is limited by reliance on specific generators, hindering generalization to new techniques.

Method: A bi-level optimization approach: inner loop pretrains a vision encoder on photographic images with weighted pretext tasks; outer loop optimizes task weights for manipulated face detection. Detection uses a Gaussian mixture model or a lightweight classifier.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing approaches in one-class and binary classification, with strong generalization to unseen generators.

Conclusion: The self-supervised bi-level optimization method enhances AI-generated face detection, offering better generalization and performance.

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

*Qingcheng Zhao,Xiang Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Zeyuan Chen,Jianwen Xie,Yuan Gao,Zhuowen Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepR is a depth-guided framework for single-view scene reconstruction, using instance-level diffusion and depth throughout training and inference for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize depth, limiting reconstruction quality. DepR aims to fully exploit depth for better geometric encoding and alignment.

Method: DepR integrates depth-guided conditioning in diffusion models and uses depth for DDIM sampling and layout optimization during inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DepR demonstrates the effectiveness of depth-guided diffusion in single-view scene reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular multi-agent framework for UI-to-code generation improves robustness and interpretability by breaking the process into grounding, planning, and generation stages, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-code LLMs lack effectiveness in capturing spatial layout and visual design intent, which are critical for UI development.

Method: A three-stage framework: grounding (detects UI components), planning (constructs hierarchical layout), and generation (produces HTML/CSS code). Extended into a scalable data engine for synthetic training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

Conclusion: The framework enhances UI-to-code generation by combining modularity, interpretability, and scalability, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.

### [65] [CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22828)
*Kedong Xiu,Saiqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover is a framework for recovering high-level semantic content from intermediate features in split-DNN configurations, addressing privacy risks without image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks from semantic information leakage in split-DNN setups where visual encoders operate on user devices.

Method: CapRecover recovers semantic content (labels/captions) directly from intermediate features, avoiding image reconstruction. It also introduces noise addition/removal for protection.

Result: Achieves 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and fluent captions on COCO2017 (ROUGE-L 0.52). Deeper layers encode more semantics.

Conclusion: CapRecover effectively recovers semantics and mitigates leakage via noise-based protection, offering privacy without extra training costs.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

*Siqi Luo,Haoran Yang,Yi Xin,Mingyang Yi,Guangyang Wu,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TR-PTS is a task-driven framework for efficient fine-tuning of large models by selecting task-relevant parameters and tokens, improving both performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained models are impractical for fine-tuning due to high costs, and existing PEFT methods are task-agnostic, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: TR-PTS uses Fisher Information Matrix for parameter selection and dynamic token merging to focus on task-relevant information.

Result: TR-PTS outperforms full fine-tuning by 3.40% on FGVC and 10.35% on VTAB-1k benchmarks.

Conclusion: TR-PTS enhances efficiency and accuracy, making it a practical solution for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing GPU workload due to complex content rendering in modern games by leveraging AI for efficient upscaling.

Method: Train LCS on GameIR image pairs using adversarial training, reparameterization, and quantization to reduce model complexity. Compare with AMD's EASF and FSR1.

Result: LCS outperforms AMD's methods in perceptual quality, showing ESR models' potential for resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: LCS is a viable solution for GPU workload reduction, offering superior perceptual quality for upscaling on low-power devices.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Result: OISA outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on related tasks.

Conclusion: OmniAVS and OISA advance RAVS by enhancing multimodal reasoning and understanding.

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant
advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and
deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how deceptive instructions alter the internal representations of LLMs, revealing distinct shifts in early-to-mid layers and identifiable features sensitive to deception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deceptive instructions change LLM representations compared to truthful ones, beyond output analysis.

Method: Analyzed internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct using linear probes and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on a factual verification task.

Result: Deceptive instructions cause significant representational shifts, detectable in early-to-mid layers, with specific SAE features highly sensitive to deception.

Conclusion: The study identifies layer-wise and feature-level correlates of deception, aiding in detection and mitigation of instructed dishonesty in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper redefines systematicity in AI beyond explainability, distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought' to reconcile it with connectionism. It argues for a dynamic, rationale-driven approach to systematizing AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the broader ideal of systematicity in AI, moving beyond the narrow focus on explainability and resolving tensions between systematicity and connectionism.

Method: Introduces a conceptual framework distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought' and applies five rationales for systematization to AI models.

Result: Shows that the traditional Fodorian notion of systematicity is less demanding than the historical ideal, and identifies the 'hard systematicity challenge' for AI.

Conclusion: Advocates for a dynamic, rationale-regulated approach to systematizing AI, determining how and when AI models should be systematic.

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

TL;DR: CoEx introduces a hierarchical agent architecture to dynamically update LLM world models, improving planning accuracy by incorporating new observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely on static world models, leading to misalignment with the true state of the world and erroneous plans.

Method: CoEx uses hierarchical state abstraction and neurosymbolic belief states (textual inferences and symbolic memory) to dynamically update the world model.

Result: CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration across diverse scenarios like ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho.

Conclusion: Dynamic world model updates in CoEx enhance planning accuracy and adaptability in complex environments.

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Result: The framework demonstrated effectiveness in achieving realistic social emergence in the tested scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the alignment of LLM-based agents with relational facts, addressing key challenges in Metaverse service ecosystems.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and

digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents lack human-level performance and pose safety risks; human-in-the-loop systems can enhance productivity and safety.

Method: Developed Magentic-UI with multi-agent architecture, MCP for tool integration, and six interaction mechanisms for human involvement.

Result: Evaluated across benchmarks, user testing, qualitative studies, and safety assessments, showing promise for human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: Magentic-UI advances safe and efficient collaboration between humans and AI agents.

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

TL;DR: A benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, LLM-Crowdsourced, is proposed to address issues in evaluating LLMs, offering dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs face challenges like data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference, hindering comprehensive assessment.

Method: The LLM-Crowdsourced method uses LLMs to generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually, integrating four key criteria.

Result: Experiments on eight LLMs in mathematics and programming show the method's effectiveness, revealing novel findings like Gemini's superior question-design capabilities and memorization-based answering in some LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust, objective, and professional way to evaluate LLMs, uncovering insights traditional methods miss.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [76] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI's metacognitive sensitivity (accurate confidence estimates) can improve human decision-making, even if the AI has lower predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI's predictive accuracy and confidence estimates jointly impact human decision quality.

Method: Theoretical framework and behavioral experiment to assess AI's metacognitive sensitivity and its effect on decision-making.

Result: AI with higher metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance, even with lower predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: AI assistance should be evaluated and optimized for both accuracy and metacognitive sensitivity to enhance decision outcomes.

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general criterion for intelligence based on sample fidelity, defining it as the ability to generate samples indistinguishable from original ones within a tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture the essence of intelligence in a species-agnostic form that can be evaluated and applied across diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior.

Method: Introduces the concept of ε-category intelligence, formalizing intelligence as the ability to generate samples indistinguishable from original ones within a tolerance ε.

Result: Presents a formal framework, empirical protocols, and discusses implications for evaluation, safety, and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed criterion offers a generalizable and evaluable measure of intelligence, with potential applications in AGI engineering, safety, and generalization.

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper addresses legal compliance challenges for autonomous vehicles in transnational contexts, offering a reasoning system to aid designers in understanding and adapting to legal implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support designers in navigating the complex legal landscape of autonomous vehicles across borders by providing a structured reasoning framework.

Method: Uses argumentation theory and partial order sets of natural numbers to model normative reasoning and priority, applied through case analysis of legal texts.

Result: Demonstrates how the reasoning system helps designers flexibly adapt designs and better understand legal implications in cross-border scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively aids designers in addressing legal compliance challenges for autonomous vehicles in transnational contexts.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves the Nearest-Better Network (NBN) method for combinatorial optimization, showing its role as a maximum probability transition network and introducing an efficient computation method. Applications reveal landscape features and algorithm limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NBN method is time-consuming and challenging to extend to combinatorial problems, hindering its use in analyzing algorithm behavior.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical derivation of NBN as a transition network and introduces an efficient logarithmic linear time computation method.

Result: Applied to OneMax and TSP, the method reveals landscape features (neutrality, ruggedness, modality) and identifies limitations in EAX and LKH algorithms.

Conclusion: The efficient NBN method enables deeper analysis of optimization landscapes and highlights algorithm-specific challenges in combinatorial problems.

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

TL;DR: An AI-driven multi-agent system improves emergency department triage by addressing medical specialization gaps, heterogeneous structures, and inefficient questioning, achieving high accuracy in department classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The post-pandemic healthcare demand surge and nursing shortages necessitate innovative AI solutions for efficient and accurate triage.

Method: The system uses three specialized agents (RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent, DepartmentAgent) collaborating via structured inquiry and department-specific rules, evaluated on a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset.

Result: Achieves 89.2% primary and 73.9% secondary department classification accuracy after four patient interactions.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable framework for AI-assisted triage adaptable to diverse healthcare institutions, ensuring clinically sound decisions.

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent is a framework for automatically generating multi-agent systems using finite state machines, outperforming existing auto-designed methods and matching human-designed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks are limited to pre-defined scenarios, and automated methods lack flexibility, tool integration, and robust communication.

Method: MetaAgent uses finite state machines to design and optimize multi-agent systems from task descriptions, controlling agent actions and state transitions.

Result: Experiments show MetaAgent surpasses auto-designed methods and matches human-designed systems in performance.

Conclusion: MetaAgent provides a flexible, automated solution for multi-agent system design, addressing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can translate natural language to SPARQL for KG queries in manufacturing, improving with context-aware prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify KG data retrieval for non-experts by leveraging LLMs to bridge natural language and SPARQL.

Method: Evaluate strategies for feeding KG context to LLMs, tested on Bosch and I40 KGs.

Result: LLMs perform better with adequate KG schema context, reducing errors.

Conclusion: Context-aware LLM techniques democratize KG access and enhance manufacturing decision-making.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces asp-fzn, a solver for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), which translates CASP programs into FlatZinc for use with various backend solvers. It shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art ASP solvers and outperforms clingcon in some CASP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Answer Set Programming (ASP) with linear constraints and provide a solver-independent solution via FlatZinc, enabling compatibility with multiple backend solvers.

Method: The approach involves translating CASP programs into the FlatZinc language, supporting linear constraints and global constraints, and evaluating performance against ASP and CASP solvers.

Result: asp-fzn is competitive with state-of-the-art ASP solvers and outperforms clingcon in some CASP benchmarks, demonstrating promising performance.

Conclusion: asp-fzn is a viable and competitive solver for CASP, offering flexibility through FlatZinc and strong performance in benchmarks.

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing multi-agent collaboration in cooperative environments by addressing the challenges of joint-action spaces and role diversity.

Method: Centralized Training/Centralized Execution with multi-headed attention in actor and critic, plus a penalized loss function for role diversity.

Result: TAAC outperforms benchmarks (PPO, MA3C) in metrics like win rates, goal differentials, and tactical interactions.

Conclusion: TAAC effectively improves collaboration and performance in multi-agent settings, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing SAT solvers is challenging due to complex architectures; existing methods are limited by manual constraints.

Method: Develops AutoModSAT with LLM-friendly solver guidelines, automatic prompt optimization, and efficient search strategies (presearch and EA).

Result: 50% improvement over baseline, 30% over SOTA, and 20% speedup.

Conclusion: Bridges AI-driven heuristics and system optimization, offering methodological and empirical advancements for solver development.

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IndoPref, the first human-authored Indonesian preference dataset for evaluating LLM-generated text, addressing underrepresentation in multilingual research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indonesian is underrepresented in LLM preference research, and existing datasets lack cultural authenticity due to English translations.

Method: Created IndoPref, a multi-domain dataset with native Indonesian annotations, evaluated using Krippendorff's alpha for agreement.

Result: Strong inter-annotator agreement was achieved, and multiple LLMs were benchmarked for output quality.

Conclusion: IndoPref fills a critical gap in Indonesian LLM research, providing a culturally authentic evaluation tool.

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of writing style diversity in current LLM benchmarks and tests how style variations impact LLM performance using persona-based prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs lack diversity in writing styles, potentially leading to brittle performance in non-standard scenarios.

Method: The study rewrites evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting to emulate diverse writing styles.

Result: Writing style and prompt formatting significantly affect LLM performance, with certain styles consistently triggering high or low performance across models.

Conclusion: The work proposes a scalable method to enhance benchmarks, improving their validity for assessing LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated pipeline using LLMs estimates Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs) more accurately and scalably than existing tools, outperforming parsers and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for calculating VFFs are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility, hindering syntax analysis in human and machine language systems.

Method: LLMs generate a corpus of sentences with 476 verbs, then analyze syntactic structures as an expert linguist, outperforming traditional parsers.

Result: The pipeline creates a new VFF database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntax, and frequency estimates, while being customizable and extensible.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates scalable VFF estimation, releasing code and data for future research.

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how media memorability, beyond mere exposure, influences venture capital investment by analyzing UK startups in micro/nanotech sectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research narrowly focused on general media exposure, overlooking nuanced media content effects on funding decisions.

Method: Analyzed data from 197 UK startups (1995-2004) to measure media memorability's impact on investment outcomes.

Result: Media memorability significantly affects funding, with venture capitalists valuing distinctiveness and semantic network connectivity.

Conclusion: Startups should prioritize targeted, meaningful media coverage to enhance memorability and attract investment.

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

### [91] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of first-token approximations for estimating contextual entropy in psycholinguistics, proposing Monte Carlo (MC) estimates for more accurate word entropy measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underestimation and distortion of true word entropy caused by first-token approximations in language models.

Method: Proposes Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of word entropy, allowing words to span variable tokens, and tests these against first-token approximations in regression experiments on reading times.

Result: Divergent results between first-token and MC word entropy suggest first-token approximations may distort findings.

Conclusion: Caution is advised when using first-token approximations for contextual entropy, with MC estimates offering a more reliable alternative.

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

### [92] [RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219)
*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR introduces a novel framework for machine translation by leveraging continuous feedback from GPT-4o, outperforming traditional methods on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference-learning methods for MT rely on static datasets and struggle with generalization. RLfR aims to address this by using dynamic feedback from a teacher model.

Method: RLfR uses iterative refinement with GPT-4o, combining negative edit distance and COMET score for feedback. The actor learns incrementally by aligning with the teacher's refinements.

Result: RLfR outperforms MT-SFT and preference-based baselines on FLORES-200, improving COMET and M-ETA scores.

Conclusion: RLfR offers a scalable and effective alternative to static triplet-based methods, enhancing translation quality through continuous learning.

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

### [93] [Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22286)
*Supantho Rakshit,Adele Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if LLMs reflect graded, meaning-infused representations of constructions, finding that prototypical exemplars occupy distinct regions in activation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' internal representations align with the function-infused gradience proposed by the usage-based constructionist approach.

Method: Analyzed neural representations of English dative constructions in Pythia-1.4B using a dataset of 5000 sentence pairs varied for human-rated preference strength, employing geometric measures like Energy Distance and Jensen-Shannon Divergence.

Result: Separability between construction representations is modulated by preference strength, with prototypical exemplars occupying more distinct regions in LLMs' activation space.

Conclusion: LLMs learn rich, graded representations of constructions, supporting geometric measures of constructionist principles in these models.

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

*Galo Castillo-López,Gaël de Chalendar,Nasredine Semmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining BERT and LLMs for intent recognition and OOS detection in TODS, improving performance in zero and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TODS require large annotated datasets; this work aims to reduce dependency on labeled data by leveraging BERT and LLMs.

Method: Combines BERT's efficiency with LLMs' generalization in zero and few-shot settings, sharing BERT outputs with LLMs.

Result: Improved system performance on multi-party conversation corpora.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively enhances intent recognition and OOS detection with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

*Roxana Petcu,Samarth Bhargav,Maarten de Rijke,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of negation in neural information retrieval and LLM-based models, introducing a taxonomy, benchmark datasets, and a logic-based classification mechanism to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural models underperform on queries with negation, prompting a study to understand and improve their handling of negation.

Method: The authors introduce a negation taxonomy, generate benchmark datasets, and propose a logic-based classification mechanism.

Result: The taxonomy improves data distribution and training convergence on the NevIR dataset, and the classification schema reveals dataset coverage of negation types.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance understanding and performance of models on negation, providing insights for better generalization.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

*Jia Li,Yichao He,Jiacheng Xu,Tianhao Luo,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Traits Run Deep,' a novel framework for personality assessment using psychology-informed prompts and a Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network to align multimodal signals, achieving a 45% MSE reduction and top performance in the AVI Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personality assessment is crucial for emotional intelligence, mental health, and education, but traditional methods struggle with cross-modal understanding and superficial features.

Method: The framework uses psychology-informed prompts for LLMs, a Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network with a Chunk-Wise Projector, Cross-Modal Connector, Text Feature Enhancer, and ensemble regression for generalization.

Result: Achieved a 45% MSE reduction on the AVI validation set and ranked first in the AVI Challenge 2025 Personality Assessment track.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves personality assessment by leveraging multimodal fusion and psychology-guided semantics, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

TL;DR: PATENTWRITER is a benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation, showing modern LLMs outperform domain-specific baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the tedious patent-filing process by leveraging LLMs for patent abstract generation.

Method: Evaluated six LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA-3) using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting on patent claims. Assessed quality via NLP metrics, robustness, downstream tasks, and stylistic analysis.

Result: Modern LLMs generate high-fidelity, stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for patent abstract generation, with PATENTWRITER providing a reproducible framework for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

Motivation: To enhance reading comprehension assessment for young English learners by providing tailored, diverse questions.

Method: Uses language models to generate varied question types and difficulty levels, adapting to learner proficiencies.

Result: Demonstrates potential for autonomous AI-driven English instruction.

Conclusion: The approach could significantly improve reading comprehension evaluation for early learners.

Abstract: Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays
an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English

framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous

*Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The NIAH benchmark may overestimate LLMs' long-context understanding. The authors propose NeedleChain, a new benchmark with fully query-relevant contexts, and ROPE Contraction to improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the NIAH benchmark in evaluating LLMs' true long-context understanding.

Method: Introduce NeedleChain, a benchmark with query-relevant contexts, and ROPE Contraction for improving LLM performance.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with fully understanding long contexts, even when relevant.

Conclusion: NeedleChain and ROPE Contraction offer better evaluation and improvement of LLMs' long-context understanding.

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

TL;DR: The study examines if an AI language model trained on Anglo-American texts can generate culturally relevant stories for other nationalities, finding a homogenized narrative structure across 236 countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess cultural relevance and narrative diversity in AI-generated stories for non-Anglo-American contexts.

Method: Generated 11,800 stories (50 per country) using GPT-4o-mini with the prompt 'Write a 1500-word potential {demonym} story.' Analyzed narrative structures and themes.

Result: Stories showed surface-level cultural symbols but conformed to a single plot: protagonist resolves minor conflict through tradition and community, lacking real-world tension or romance.

Conclusion: AI-generated narratives exhibit structural homogeneity, a form of bias prioritizing stability and tradition, relevant to AI alignment and narrative studies.

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1 introduces hybrid architecture LLMs combining Transformer and State Space Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficiency across various tasks and model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize performance and efficiency in large language models by integrating Transformer-based attention with State Space Models, addressing long-context memory and computational challenges.

Method: Adopts a parallel hybrid approach combining Transformer and SSMs, revisits model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, and releases multiple configurations (0.5B to 34B parameters).

Result: Falcon-H1 models outperform larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B, Llama3.3-70B) with fewer parameters and data, excelling in reasoning, multilingual tasks, and more. Supports 256K context tokens and 18 languages.

Conclusion: Falcon-H1 sets a new benchmark for efficient, high-performance LLMs, released under an open-source license to promote accessible AI research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot settings but improve significantly with minimal parameter tuning, though results don't generalize across datasets, prompting a reevaluation of what defines an 'abstract reasoner.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the claim that LLMs are not abstract reasoners by examining their performance under minimal tuning.

Method: Revisiting experiments, testing LLMs in zero-shot and tuned settings, and evaluating transferability across datasets.

Result: LLMs achieve near-perfect performance with minor tuning but fail to generalize across datasets.

Conclusion: The findings call for a deeper discussion on the definition and significance of 'abstract reasoning' in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

TL;DR: The paper introduces forward and backward constraints to enhance Code LLMs' instruction-following in controlled code generation and presents IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark for nuanced evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world code generation requires stricter adherence to detailed requirements beyond correctness, which current Code LLMs struggle with.

Method: The authors propose forward and backward constraints generation and introduce IFEvalCode, a benchmark with 1.6K multilingual test samples, evaluating correctness and instruction-following separately.

Result: Experiments on 40+ LLMs show closed-source models outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation, revealing a gap between correctness and precise instruction-following.

Conclusion: The work advances controlled code generation by improving instruction-following and providing a detailed evaluation framework.

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

Motivation: Explore the potential of SLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks despite their limited logical reasoning, leveraging their advantages in speed and edge deployment.

Method: Used SynSQL-2.5M to create datasets for SQL generation and merge revision, applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and used corrective self-consistency for inference.

Result: Average improvement of 31.4 points on BIRD development set; 0.5B model reached 56.87% EX, 1.5B model achieved 67.08% EX.

Conclusion: Post-training techniques significantly enhance SLM performance in Text-to-SQL, making them viable for practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,

TL;DR: CliCARE is a framework for grounding LLMs in clinical guidelines to improve decision support in oncology by addressing challenges like long EHRs, clinical hallucination, and unreliable metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clinical decision support and reduce physician burnout by leveraging LLMs for synthesizing complex cancer EHRs, while overcoming challenges like long records and unreliable evaluations.

Method: CliCARE transforms unstructured EHRs into Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) and aligns them with clinical guidelines for evidence-grounded decision support.

Result: CliCARE outperforms baselines in diverse datasets (Chinese and English), with high clinical validity confirmed by expert oncologists.

Conclusion: CliCARE effectively grounds LLMs in clinical guidelines, offering reliable decision support for oncology, validated by expert assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSConDa, a Vietnamese customer support QA dataset, and evaluates 11 lightweight ViLLMs to address the lack of domain-specific benchmarks for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of benchmark datasets for Vietnamese LLMs in customer service makes it hard for enterprises to choose suitable models.

Method: Created CSConDa, a dataset of 9,000 QA pairs from real interactions, and evaluated 11 ViLLMs using automatic metrics and syntactic analysis.

Result: The study provides insights into model performance, strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic patterns, aiding model selection and improvement.

Conclusion: CSConDa and the evaluation framework support informed model selection and advance research on Vietnamese LLMs for customer service QA.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly
available at

### [107] [ControlMed: Adding Reasoning Control to Medical Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22545)
*Sung-Min Lee,Siyoon Lee,Juyeon Kim,Kyungmin Roh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ControlMed is a medical LLM that allows users to control reasoning length, improving efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs in medicine generate lengthy reasoning, causing computational overhead and latency, hindering practical use.

Method: Three-stage training: pre-training on synthetic medical data, supervised fine-tuning with length-control markers, and reinforcement learning for accuracy.

Result: Achieves comparable or better performance on medical benchmarks, with flexible reasoning length control.

Conclusion: ControlMed is a practical, adaptable solution for clinical QA and medical analysis.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

*Xikang Yang,Biyu Zhou,Xuehai Tang,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CognitiveAttack is a framework exploiting multi-bias interactions to bypass LLM safety, outperforming SOTA methods with a 60.1% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks exploiting cognitive biases, but prior work overlooks multi-bias interactions.

Method: Combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate prompts with optimized bias combinations.

Result: Achieves 60.1% attack success rate, exposing vulnerabilities in 30 LLMs, especially open-source models.

Conclusion: Multi-bias interactions are a powerful attack vector, bridging cognitive science and AI safety for more robust systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

*Inaya Rahmanisa,Lyzander Marciano Andrylie,Krisna Mahardika Ihsani,Alfan Farizki Wicaksono,Haryo Akbarianto Wibowo,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amplifying language-specific neurons in LLMs improves target language performance but often harms cross-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of language-specific neurons in multilingual models and their impact when amplified.

Method: Interventions amplifying language-specific neurons across 18 languages, evaluated using Language Steering Shift (LSS) and downstream tasks.

Result: Optimal amplification steers output to target languages but degrades cross-language performance.

Conclusion: Amplification benefits low-resource languages but offers limited cross-lingual transfer advantages.

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BALSAM is introduced as a community-driven benchmark to address gaps in Arabic LLM evaluation, offering comprehensive task coverage, blind testing, and a transparent platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LLMs lag due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity, and poor benchmark quality, hindering progress and accurate evaluation.

Method: BALSAM includes 78 NLP tasks across 14 categories, with 52K examples (37K test, 15K dev) and a blind evaluation platform.

Result: BALSAM provides a standardized, transparent framework for evaluating and advancing Arabic LLMs.

Conclusion: BALSAM aims to unify and elevate Arabic LLM research through collaboration and robust benchmarking.

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

*Daniil Gurgurov,Katharina Trinley,Yusser Al Ghussin,Tanja Baeumel,Josef van Genabith,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates language-specific neurons in LLMs, showing their clustering in deeper layers and specialization for non-Latin scripts. Language arithmetics (activation manipulation) outperforms simpler methods in multilingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing in multilingual LLMs.

Method: Analyzes neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse models using LAPE and language arithmetics (activation addition/multiplication).

Result: Language-specific neurons cluster in deeper layers; non-Latin scripts show greater specialization. Language arithmetics effectively guides behavior in multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: Neuron manipulation enhances multilingual performance, with effectiveness tied to language resources and typological similarity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

*Daniil Gurgurov,Katharina Trinley,Ivan Vykopal,Josef van Genabith,Simon Ostermann,Roberto Zamparelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates political biases in open-source LLMs, revealing a libertarian-left skew in larger models and demonstrating the ability to manipulate these biases across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in understanding political biases in LLMs, including generalizability across models, languages, and the potential for active control.

Method: Evaluated seven models (e.g., LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3) across 14 languages using the Political Compass Test with paraphrased statements. Tested bias manipulation via a center-of-mass activation technique.

Result: Larger models consistently lean libertarian-left, with variations by language and model. The intervention successfully steered responses toward alternative ideologies.

Conclusion: Political biases in LLMs are generalizable and manipulable, highlighting the need for awareness and control in deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

*Jia Li,Yang Wang,Wenhao Qian,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for interview performance assessment integrates video, audio, and text data, evaluating 365 aspects via multimodal fusion and ensemble learning, achieving top results in the AVI Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure holistic and fair evaluations of candidates by capturing explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data.

Method: Uses modality-specific feature extractors and a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron for fusion, followed by a two-level ensemble learning strategy for robust predictions.

Result: Achieved a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824 and secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The framework effectively advances automated, multimodal interview performance assessment, demonstrating robustness and fairness.

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

*Jie He,Victor Gutierrez Basulto,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TIRESRAG-R1 improves RAG methods by addressing intermediate reasoning flaws with a multi-dimensional reward system, outperforming prior methods on QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods focus only on final-answer rewards, neglecting intermediate reasoning quality, leading to failures like insufficient retrieval, faulty reasoning, and inconsistency.

Method: Proposes TIRESRAG-R1, using a think-retrieve-reflect process and rewards for sufficiency, reasoning quality, and reflection, plus difficulty-aware reweighting and sample filtering.

Result: Outperforms prior RAG methods on four multi-hop QA datasets and generalizes well to single-hop tasks.

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1 effectively enhances reasoning and stability in RAG methods, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data
are available at: https://github.com/probe2/TIRESRAG-R1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in LLMs across Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin, finding fewer hallucinations in Mandarin compared to Hindi and Farsi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucination is crucial for improving LLM reliability, especially in non-English languages.

Method: Analyzed conversational data in Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin for factual and linguistic errors in multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1, Qwen-3).

Result: LLMs produced fewer hallucinations in Mandarin but significantly more in Hindi and Farsi.

Conclusion: Hallucination rates vary by language, highlighting the need for language-specific improvements in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to adapt LLMs for better text embeddings, achieving top performance on MTEB's clustering task through aggregation, prompt engineering, and contrastive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' token-level embeddings lose information when pooled for non-generative tasks, necessitating better adaptation strategies.

Method: Three strategies: (i) token embedding aggregation, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, (iii) contrastive fine-tuning with synthetic data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MTEB's English clustering track; fine-tuning shifts attention to semantically relevant words.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively adapted for text embeddings via prompt engineering and contrastive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

TL;DR: A reward-driven fine-tuning framework is introduced to reduce entity hallucinations in abstractive summarization using the Entity Hallucination Index (EHI) as a reward signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in abstractive summarization hinder real-world deployment of language models, necessitating a scalable solution.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune a pre-trained LM, optimizing for EHI scores derived from automatic entity extraction and matching.

Result: Improves EHI scores across datasets, reducing entity hallucinations without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, annotation-free approach to enhance entity faithfulness in summaries, supported by a reproducible pipeline for further research.

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for open-ended regional QA with text and visual modalities is introduced, using LLMs as baselines. The dataset includes multilingual questions from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with human evaluations revealing gaps in LLMs' regional knowledge and poor correlation between automated metrics and human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess regional knowledge in LLMs, study cross-lingual consistency, and improve evaluation metrics for open-ended QA.

Method: Manually curated multilingual dataset (text and visual questions) evaluated using LLMs and human judgments.

Result: Significant gaps in LLMs' regional knowledge; minimal correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a resource for evaluating LLMs' regional knowledge, cross-lingual consistency, and advancing QA evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assessment is underexplored in LLM applications, relying on outdated rule-based methods. MASCA aims to modernize this with collaborative agents.

Method: MASCA uses a layered architecture of specialized LLM-based agents and integrates contrastive learning for risk-reward optimization. It also applies signaling game theory for system insights.

Result: MASCA outperforms baseline methods, proving hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems effective for credit scoring.

Conclusion: MASCA demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly for fair and accurate credit assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

Motivation: To improve entity linking in DBLP's updated Knowledge Graph by introducing a zero-shot approach using LLMs, addressing the inclusion of new entity types like dblp:Stream.

Method: Develops a zero-shot entity linker using LLMs, re-ranking candidates based on log-probabilities of the 'yes' token at the penultimate layer.

Result: The method replaces traditional KG-embeddings and re-rankers, offering a zero-shot solution for entity linking.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot approach using LLMs effectively addresses entity linking in DBLP's updated Knowledge Graph, showcasing adaptability to new entity types.

Abstract: In this work we present an entity linker for DBLP's 2025 version of RDF-based
Knowledge Graph. Compared to the 2022 version, DBLP now considers publication
venues as a new entity type called dblp:Stream. In the earlier version of
DBLPLink, we trained KG-embeddings and re-rankers on a dataset to produce
entity linkings. In contrast, in this work, we develop a zero-shot entity
linker using LLMs using a novel method, where we re-rank candidate entities
based on the log-probabilities of the "yes" token output at the penultimate
layer of the LLM.

### [122] [Beyond Natural Language Plans: Structure-Aware Planning for Query-Focused Table Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22829)
*Weijia Zhang,Songgaojun Deng,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaSoF, a structured plan for query-focused table summarization, and SPaGe, a framework to formalize reasoning in three phases, outperforming prior models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NL plans for table summarization are ambiguous and lack structure, limiting scalability and conversion to executable programs like SQL.

Method: Introduces TaSoF (structured plan) and SPaGe framework with three phases: Structured Planning, Graph-based Execution, and Summary Generation.

Result: SPaGe outperforms prior models in single- and multi-table benchmarks, showing robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: Structured representations like TaSoF and SPaGe improve reliability and scalability in query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

### [123] [Where to show Demos in Your Prompt: A Positional Bias of In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22887)
*Kwesi Cobbina,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a positional bias in in-context learning (ICL) called DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias, showing that demo placement in prompts affects model accuracy and predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored positional bias in ICL, as performance varies with demo placement in prompts.

Method: A systematic evaluation pipeline with metrics (ACCURACY-CHANGE, PREDICTION-CHANGE) tested on ten LLMs across tasks.

Result: Demo placement impacts accuracy and predictions; start-of-prompt demos yield stable results (+6 points), while end-of-message demos cause prediction flips (30%).

Conclusion: DPP bias significantly affects LLMs, with smaller models more sensitive, though large models also show marginal impact on complex tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

*Yangshu Yuan,Heng Chen,Xinyi Jiang,Christian Ng,Kexin Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIMR, a new framework for multi-modal reasoning, outperforms state-of-the-art models by integrating iterative refinement and self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs and LVLMs in handling complex, multi-step multi-modal tasks requiring logical reasoning and feedback integration.

Method: Proposes CIMR with a two-stage process: initial reasoning/response generation and iterative refinement using multi-modal feedback, enhanced by a dynamic fusion module.

Result: Achieves 91.5% accuracy on the MAP dataset, surpassing models like GPT-4V (89.2%) and LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%).

Conclusion: CIMR's iterative reasoning and self-correction significantly improve performance in complex multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

*Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive pseudo-labeling framework for CLIP, improving unsupervised adaptation by integrating prototype and neighborhood-based consistency, outperforming fixed-threshold methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pseudo-labels from zero-shot predictions in CLIP are noisy under domain shifts or complex visuals; fixed-threshold filtering is unreliable in unsupervised settings.

Method: Introduces PICS (assesses pseudo-label accuracy via feature compactness/separation) and NALR (refines labels using neighborhood semantic similarities) with adaptive weighting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 benchmarks, providing more accurate pseudo-labels efficiently.

Conclusion: The framework enhances CLIP's adaptation, offering a robust solution for noisy pseudo-labels in unsupervised settings.

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohammad Abdul Hafeez Khan,Yash Jain,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A closed-loop framework (TIR) refines prompts for text-to-image models using a pretrained MLLM to improve output alignment and coherence without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address prompt sensitivity in T2I models, where minor wording changes cause inconsistent or inaccurate outputs.

Method: Iterative refinement: generate image, analyze with MLLM for misalignments, refine prompt, repeat.

Result: Improved alignment and visual coherence across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TIR effectively enhances T2I outputs without modifying the underlying model, mimicking human iterative refinement.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Bayesian optimization (BO) and multi-fidelity BO (MFBO) for optimizing energy absorption in spinodoid structures, showing MFBO outperforms BO by up to 11%. It also uses Sobol' samples and sensitivity analysis to simplify design complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of direct comparison between BO and MFBO in real-life engineering problems and improve sampling quality and parameter sensitivity analysis in data-driven design.

Method: Employs Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis and compares BO and MFBO for optimizing energy absorption in spinodoid structures.

Result: MFBO outperforms BO by up to 11% in maximizing energy absorption, demonstrating its effectiveness for expensive data-driven design problems.

Conclusion: MFBO is a superior method for optimizing expensive objectives like energy absorption, and open-source results support broader utility of multi-fidelity techniques.

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

*Sergii Kavun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two hybrid activation functions, S3 and S4, to address issues like dead neurons and vanishing gradients in traditional functions. S4 outperforms baselines in accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) have limitations like dead neurons and vanishing gradients, hindering neural network performance.

Method: Proposes S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign hybrid) and S4 (smoothed S3 with tunable parameter k). Tests on binary/multi-class classification and regression tasks.

Result: S4 achieves 97.4% accuracy (MNIST), 96.0% (Iris), and 18.7 MSE (Boston Housing). Faster convergence and stable gradients compared to ReLU.

Conclusion: Hybrid activation functions, especially S4, improve training dynamics and performance, offering versatility for deep learning.

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

### [131] [Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174)
*Molly Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spatial-temporal RL approach using GNNs and RNNs outperforms traditional RL in packet routing by better capturing spatial and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL and MDP frameworks fail in non-Markovian scenarios and lack explicit spatial relationship modeling in complex network topologies.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal RL method integrating GNNs for spatial dynamics and RNNs for temporal traffic patterns.

Result: The method outperforms traditional RL techniques and is more robust to topology changes.

Conclusion: The spatial-temporal RL approach effectively addresses limitations of traditional RL in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SourceGrasp and SourceSplice to select optimal data sources for ML tasks, improving downstream model performance with fewer explorations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data discovery methods ignore source quality for ML performance, creating a gap in selecting the best data sources.

Method: Proposes SourceGrasp (metaheuristic with greediness and randomization) and SourceSplice (inspired by gene splicing) for efficient source selection.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows SourceSplice identifies high-utility subsets with fewer explorations, outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: SourceSplice effectively addresses the challenge of selecting quality data sources for ML tasks, demonstrating robustness across settings.

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

TL;DR: Proposes a Wasserstein distance-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by modeling datasets as multivariate normal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for measuring time-series dataset similarity to aid in model selection, finetuning, and visualization.

Method: Models time-series datasets as multivariate normal distributions and computes similarity using Wasserstein distance.

Result: Effective in identifying similar datasets and estimating foundation model performance, with high correlation (>0.60) to inference loss.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein distance-based method is a viable tool for time-series dataset similarity measurement and performance estimation.

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote fetal monitoring systems lack interpretability, making raw CTG data hard for expectant parents to understand.

Method: CTG-Insight uses a multi-agent LLM system to analyze CTG traces into five features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, sinusoidal pattern) and synthesizes results with a natural language explanation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score (97.8%) on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset, outperforming deep learning and single-agent LLM baselines.

Conclusion: CTG-Insight provides an interpretable and extensible framework for CTG analysis, improving transparency in fetal health monitoring.

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Method: Evaluated Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM for forecasting electricity load up to one year ahead, with SHAP for feature contribution analysis.

Result: SHAP improved model explainability and accuracy by quantifying feature contributions, aiding feature engineering and transparency.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, especially with SHAP, enhance midterm load forecasting accuracy and interpretability for power systems.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), for forecasting system-wide electricity load up to one year in
advance. Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance
scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market
participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley
Additive Explanations" (SHAP) to improve model explainability. SHAP enables the

TL;DR: TRIBE is a multimodal deep neural network that predicts brain responses across modalities, cortical areas, and individuals, outperforming unimodal models and winning the Algonauts 2025 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuroscience's fragmented approach hinders unified cognition models. TRIBE aims to integrate multimodal data for a holistic brain response model.

Method: Combines pretrained text, audio, and video foundational models with a transformer to handle time-evolving fMRI responses.

Result: Achieved top performance in Algonauts 2025, excelling in high-level associative cortices compared to unimodal models.

Conclusion: TRIBE advances integrative brain modeling, with potential applications in perception and comprehension.

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction in foundation model training by estimating data source quality and resource allocation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of point estimates in data scaling decisions and improve cost-effective resource allocation for domain specialization.

Method: Extends point estimate approaches by performing multiple annealing runs to estimate scaling laws, analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs.

Result: Scaling curves for data sources can be estimated, enabling better resource allocation. Experiments on a 7B-parameter model validate the approach.

Conclusion: The framework enables data-driven decision-making for optimizing data sources, outperforming traditional micro-annealing techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

*Hanqi Zhou,Fryderyk Mantiuk,David G. Nagy,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces representational empowerment, shifting focus from external control to internal knowledge adaptability for general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI focuses on external objectives, leading to specialized but inflexible agents. The paper aims to address this by prioritizing internal knowledge control.

Method: Proposes representational empowerment, measuring an agent's ability to maintain and diversify its internal knowledge structures.

Result: Suggests that internal representation control enhances adaptability and preparedness, distinct from environmental mastery.

Conclusion: Representational empowerment offers a new paradigm for designing adaptable intelligent systems by focusing on internal knowledge.

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W-CFM improves CFM by weighting training pairs with a Gibbs kernel, enhancing efficiency and performance without costly mini-batch OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CFM produces inefficient paths, and mini-batch OT methods are computationally expensive. W-CFM aims to address these issues.

Method: W-CFM modifies CFM loss by weighting training pairs with a Gibbs kernel, approximating entropic OT coupling.

Result: W-CFM matches or outperforms baselines in sample quality, fidelity, and diversity while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: W-CFM offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to standard CFM and mini-batch OT methods.

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

*Afonso Martini Spezia,Mariana Recamonde-Mendoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates cluster-based cross-validation, proposing a new technique combining Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification. It compares methods on balanced and imbalanced datasets, finding the new method effective for balanced data but traditional stratified cross-validation better for imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential biases in cross-validation due to unrepresentative data folds and improve model evaluation strategies.

Method: Proposes a new cross-validation technique using Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification. Tests on 20 datasets with four supervised learning algorithms, comparing bias, variance, and computational cost.

Result: The new technique outperformed others on balanced datasets but not on imbalanced ones, where traditional stratified cross-validation was superior. No single clustering algorithm consistently excelled.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of cluster-based cross-validation and reaffirms the value of stratified cross-validation, especially for imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

*Romulo B. da Silva,Cássio M. Oishi,Diego Passos,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CS-SHRED integrates Compressed Sensing with a Shallow Recurrent Decoder for robust spatiotemporal data reconstruction, outperforming traditional methods with improved fidelity and noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete, compressed, or corrupted data, especially in scenarios with sparse sensors or noise.

Method: Combines CS techniques with SHRED, using batch-based forward framework with ℓ1 regularization and an adaptive loss function (MSE, MAE, SNR regularization).

Result: Demonstrates higher reconstruction fidelity (better SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS scores) in viscoelastic flows, humidity fields, and turbulent flows.

Conclusion: CS-SHRED is a powerful tool for environmental, climatic, and scientific data analysis due to its robustness and adaptive loss function.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

TL;DR: A survey of spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies for ocean science, covering datasets, data quality enhancement, task classification, and research opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and unique characteristics of ST ocean data hinder model design and training, and a comprehensive survey is missing in the literature.

Method: Review ST ocean datasets, explore data quality techniques, classify STDM tasks (prediction, event detection, pattern mining, anomaly detection), and discuss techniques for each.

Result: Identifies key techniques and challenges in STDM for ocean science, aiding cross-disciplinary understanding.

Conclusion: The survey bridges gaps between computer and ocean scientists, fostering better application of STDM techniques in ocean science.

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean
science.

TL;DR: MH-pFedHN and MH-pFedHNGD are proposed for personalized federated learning, leveraging hypernetworks for client-specific models without external data or model disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing methods in personalized federated learning, such as reliance on external data or partial learning strategies.

Method: Uses a server-side hypernetwork with client-specific embeddings to generate personalized parameters, incorporating a multi-head structure for efficiency.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and strong generalization in benchmarks, enhancing privacy and flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, scalable, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in model-heterogeneous federated learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

*Salar Basiri,Dhananjay Tiwari,Srinivasa M. Salapaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable deep learning framework (ParaSDM) for parametrized sequential decision-making, integrating Maximum Entropy Principle with a neural policy model (SPN), achieving significant speedups and cost reductions in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO) problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the NP-hard, mixed discrete-continuous nature of FLPO problems, which are challenging due to non-convex objectives and require efficient solutions for large-scale optimization.

Method: Combines Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model (Shortest Path Network, SPN), a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder for efficient gradient-based optimization.

Result: SPN achieves 100x speedup in policy inference, 10x lower cost than metaheuristics, and matches Gurobi's optimality with 1500x speedup, maintaining a 6% optimality gap.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of structured deep models for large-scale mixed-integer optimization, setting a new benchmark for ParaSDM problems.

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

*Seokho Han,Seoyeon Yoon,Jinhee Kim,Dongwei Wang,Kang Eun Jeon,Huanrui Yang,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSQ is a memory-efficient bit sparsification quantization method for DNNs, reducing training complexity and GPU memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing model efficiency for mobile and edge devices, addressing challenges in mixed-precision quantization and bit-level sparsity methods.

Method: Uses a round-clamp quantizer for differentiable LSB computation, regularization for sparsity, and Hessian information for simultaneous LSB pruning.

Result: Achieves 8.00x parameter reduction, 86% training time reduction, and competitive accuracy/compression.

Conclusion: MSQ is practical for training efficient DNNs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: Spec-VLA accelerates Vision-Language-Action models using speculative decoding, achieving 1.42x speedup without compromising success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models face computational inefficiency due to large parameter sizes and autoregressive decoding. Speculative Decoding (SD) is effective for LLMs but unexplored for VLAs.

Method: Introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework for VLAs, with a mechanism to relax acceptance using action token distances.

Result: Achieves 44% longer acceptance length and 1.42x speedup over OpenVLA baseline, maintaining success rates.

Conclusion: Spec-VLA demonstrates the potential of speculative execution in VLA prediction, offering significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Result: T-MIFPE outperforms CE, C&W, DLR, and MIFPE in attack potency and robustness evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: The T-MIFPE loss function effectively minimizes floating-point errors, improving adversarial attack accuracy and robustness assessment.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss

TL;DR: RANA is a robust active learning framework for noisy network alignment, addressing structural and labeling noise while improving alignment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing network alignment methods overlook noise issues, which degrade performance. RANA aims to tackle structural and labeling noise alongside label sparsity.

Method: RANA uses a Noise-aware Selection Module for structural noise and a Label Denoising Module for labeling noise, incorporating cleanliness scores and multi-source fusion denoising.

Result: RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods in alignment accuracy on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RANA effectively improves robustness in network alignment by addressing noise and sparsity, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in safety-sensitive applications, prompting exploration of activation functions for robustness.

Method: Proposes RCR-AF, blending GELU and ReLU features with hyperparameters to control sparsity and capacity, analyzed via Rademacher complexity.

Result: RCR-AF outperforms ReLU, GELU, and Swish in clean accuracy and adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: RCR-AF offers a principled, effective approach to improving neural network robustness through activation function design.

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Motivation: Accurate and interpretable eGFR prediction is crucial for CKD management, but existing LMMs face deployment, privacy, and reliability issues.

Method: The framework uses visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and short-term memory to boost performance and interpretability.

Result: The method matches proprietary models in predictive performance and interpretability, offering clinical reasoning for predictions.

Conclusion: The framework advances AI in healthcare by balancing accuracy with clinically meaningful interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

*Wei Guo,Yiyang Duan,Zhaojun Hu,Yiqi Tong,Fuzhen Zhuang,Xiao Zhang,Jin Dong,Ruofan Wu,Tengfei Liu,Yifan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proto-EVFL is a VFL framework using dual prototypes to address class imbalance and feature inconsistency, improving model performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in VFL leads to poor feature representation and model bias, necessitating a solution like Proto-EVFL.

Method: Uses dual prototypes, probabilistic sample selection, and adaptive feature aggregation to enhance learning.

Result: Achieves superior performance, with at least 6.97% improvement in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL effectively mitigates class imbalance and feature inconsistency in VFL, demonstrating strong empirical results.

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

*Xiang Li,Qianli Shen,Haonan Wang,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoReUn, a method for machine unlearning that dynamically reweights data based on loss, improving the forgetting of harmful content in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods treat all data equally, making it hard to forget certain data. The paper addresses this by leveraging loss to reflect unlearning difficulty.

Method: Proposes Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during unlearning with minimal computational overhead.

Result: LoReUn reduces the gap between existing methods and exact unlearning, enhancing prevention of harmful content in text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: LoReUn is a simple yet effective solution for improving machine unlearning, particularly for harmful content in generative models.

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends forecast reconciliation to nonlinear contexts, providing formal theorems for error reduction and releasing a Python package for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of formal theorems for error reduction in nonlinear forecast reconciliation, analogous to existing linear results.

Method: Derives theorems for nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions, including cases with constant-sign and non-constant-sign curvature.

Result: Establishes exact analogs of prior theorems and provides probabilistic guarantees for broader cases.

Conclusion: The work fills a theoretical gap and supports practical adoption with a released Python package.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces domain-specific pretraining tasks for molecular property prediction using SMILES strings, improving performance and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular property prediction is crucial in drug discovery, and leveraging NLP advancements can enhance learning from molecular representations like SMILES strings.

Method: The authors propose novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks for transformer models, evaluated on six classification benchmarks. Ablation studies assess efficiency.

Result: The method outperforms traditional likelihood-based training and prior fine-tuning tasks, with pretrained embeddings offering comparable performance to fine-tuning but lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining tasks enhance molecular property prediction efficiency and performance, with pretrained embeddings providing a computationally lighter alternative to fine-tuning.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy and stability in event sequence tasks, especially for unbalanced datasets, using GCN models.

Method: Integrates four GCN architectures (O-GCN, T-GCN, TP-GCN, TE-GCN) with varied graph representations, node/graph attributes, and temporal dependencies via edge weights.

Result: GCNConv models excel on unbalanced data; all models perform well on balanced data. HGCN(O) outperforms traditional methods.

Conclusion: HGCN(O) is effective for event sequence prediction, particularly in applications like Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM).

Abstract: We propose HGCN(O), a self-tuning toolkit using Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) models for event sequence prediction. Featuring four GCN architectures
(O-GCN, T-GCN, TP-GCN, TE-GCN) across the GCNConv and GraphConv layers, our
toolkit integrates multiple graph representations of event sequences with
different choices of node- and graph-level attributes and in temporal
dependencies via edge weights, optimising prediction accuracy and stability for
balanced and unbalanced datasets. Extensive experiments show that GCNConv
models excel on unbalanced data, while all models perform consistently on
balanced data. Experiments also confirm the superior performance of HGCN(O)
over traditional approaches. Applications include Predictive Business Process
Monitoring (PBPM), which predicts future events or states of a business process
based on event logs.

*Kuan-Ting Tu,Po-Hsien Yu,Yu-Syuan Tseng,Shao-Yi Chien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the FGFP framework, combining fractional Gaussian filters and adaptive pruning for efficient DNN compression, achieving high accuracy with significant model size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying heavy DNNs on edge devices by compressing models without significant accuracy loss.

Method: Integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian functions into fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs), using Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives for efficiency, and includes Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP).

Result: Achieves 85.2% model size reduction with 1.52% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-20) and 69.1% reduction with 1.63% drop on ImageNet2012 (ResNet-50).

Conclusion: The FGFP framework effectively compresses DNNs for edge deployment, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and compression.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

TL;DR: A robust framework using AutoML-enhanced DEC and Bayesian Networks predicts accident-induced congestion with 95.6% accuracy, validated by SUMO simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address traffic congestion caused by accidents, which leads to delays, emissions, and safety issues.

Method: Uses AutoML-enhanced DEC for congestion labeling and Bayesian Networks for prediction, validated via SUMO simulations.

Result: AutoML-enhanced DEC outperforms traditional methods; BN model achieves 95.6% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed BN model reliably predicts congestion, ensuring smoother urban mobility.

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

*Yanjin He,Qingkai Zeng,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Zipf's law to determine optimal vocabulary size in tokenization, showing improved model performance when token distributions align with power-law behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting an optimal vocabulary size is crucial for NLP and sequence modeling but often relies on heuristics. This work aims to provide a principled method for this choice.

Method: Analyze token frequency distributions using Zipf's law to determine vocabulary size, ensuring alignment with power-law behavior.

Result: Models achieve peak performance when token distributions closely follow Zipf's law, validated across NLP, genomics, and chemistry.

Conclusion: Zipfian alignment is a robust and generalizable criterion for selecting vocabulary size, improving model efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of ONNs, traditionally used for combinatorial optimization, in solving linear algebra problems like matrix inversion, leveraging thermodynamic principles.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical framework, identifying parameter regimes for highest computational accuracy.

Conclusion: ONNs, grounded in thermodynamics, can effectively solve linear algebra problems, with potential applications in computing.

Abstract: We describe a thermodynamic-inspired computing paradigm based on oscillatory
neural networks (ONNs). While ONNs have been widely studied as Ising machines
for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work
investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically
the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically
demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation
has the highest accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepC4, a deep learning-based spatial disaggregation method, improves urban morphology mapping in Rwanda by integrating census data and satellite imagery, outperforming traditional methods like GEM and METEOR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing discrepancies and uncertainties in coarse-to-fine-grained urban mapping, especially in developing economies, to support sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

Method: Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4) combines census statistics as constraints with multitask learning of satellite imagery patterns.

Result: Enhanced accuracy in Rwandan urban morphology maps, particularly for building exposure and vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit.

Conclusion: DeepC4 offers a scalable, deep learning-based solution for refining large-scale spatial data, aiding global sustainability goals by 2030.

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards
a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large
scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAR, a visualization tool for comparing ML models in the Rashomon set using heatmaps and scatter plots to aid in model selection and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple ML models with similar accuracies but different structures in the Rashomon set.

Method: The proposed VAR solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize and compare ML models within the Rashomon set.

Result: VAR enables developers to identify optimal models under specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's characteristics.

Conclusion: VAR provides an effective visualization method for analyzing the Rashomon set, aiding in model comparison and selection.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

*Afshin Khadangi,Amir Sartipi,Igor Tchappi,Ramin Bahmani,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLDP is a reinforcement learning-based framework for differentially private optimization, improving model utility while adhering to privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between data privacy and model utility in LLMs, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare, necessitates better DP optimization methods.

Method: RLDP uses deep reinforcement learning (SAC) to dynamically adjust per-parameter gradient-clipping thresholds and noise injection during training.

Result: RLDP reduces perplexity by 1.3-30.5% and improves downstream utility by 5.6%, while using only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget.

Conclusion: RLDP effectively balances privacy and utility, outperforming traditional DP-SGD methods in efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

*Leandro Farina,Sergey Korotov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning and XAI approach is used to derive human-interpretable rules for classifying monotone matrices, identifying key polynomial coefficients as criteria with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of easy characterization for monotone matrices, despite their simple definition, using machine learning.

Method: Combines deep neural networks with explainable AI techniques on a dataset of randomly generated matrices to identify classification criteria.

Result: Identifies two coefficients of the characteristic polynomial as sufficient for classification with 95% accuracy, leading to a simple bound for monotone matrices.

Conclusion: The study successfully applies machine learning to derive practical criteria for monotone matrix classification, demonstrating the potential of XAI in abstract algebra.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

*Alexandre Durrmeyer,Jean-Christophe Palauqui,Philippe Andrey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven approach using deep neural networks to predict cell division plane positioning from mother cell geometry, outperforming traditional hypothesis-driven geometric rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods rely on predefined geometric rules to link cell shape to division orientation, which limits flexibility. The study aims to overcome this by leveraging deep learning to uncover complex relationships.

Method: A modified UNet architecture is used to learn and predict division patterns from cell geometry, validated on synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo cells.

Result: The model successfully predicts division patterns that existing geometric rules could not explain, demonstrating its superior performance.

Conclusion: Deep networks offer a powerful tool for understanding cell division patterns and generating new hypotheses about division control.

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H2Tune addresses hybrid heterogeneity in federated fine-tuning by aligning dimensions and disentangling knowledge, achieving 15.4% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated fine-tuning methods struggle with double heterogeneity in model architectures and tasks, leading to aggregation and knowledge transfer challenges.

Method: H2Tune uses sparsified triple matrix decomposition, relation-guided alignment, and alternating task-knowledge disentanglement to handle heterogeneity.

Result: The method achieves a 15.4% accuracy boost over baselines, with theoretical convergence proven.

Conclusion: H2Tune effectively tackles hybrid heterogeneity in federated fine-tuning, improving performance and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for model selection in transductive learning under prior probability shift, optimizing hyperparameters directly on unlabelled data instead of traditional cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dataset shift in transductive learning, specifically prior probability shift, to improve model selection.

Method: Proposes optimizing hyperparameters directly on unlabelled target data, bypassing traditional cross-validation on labelled training data.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles prior probability shift in transductive learning, offering a practical alternative to traditional model selection.

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

*Max Sondag,Christofer Meinecke,Dennis Collaris,Tatiana von Landesberger,Stef van den Elzen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A visualization method and system to improve interpretability of random forests by clustering similar trees and introducing new distance metrics and visualization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random forests, while powerful, are hard to interpret. This paper aims to make them more understandable without oversimplifying.

Method: Clusters similar trees using a new distance metric, and introduces two visualization methods: Feature Plot and Rule Plot.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy on the "Glass" dataset and through a user study.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances interpretability of random forests without losing performance or generality.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

*Filippo Utro,Meltem Tolunay,Kahn Rhrissorrakrai,Tanvi P. Gujarati,Jie Shi,Sara Capponi,Mirko Amico,Nate Earnest-Noble,Laxmi Parida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum approach using Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) improves CAR T-cell cytotoxicity prediction, outperforming classical methods, especially in data-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combinatorial space of co-stimulatory domains in CAR T-cell engineering is vast and poorly explored, leading to data constraints.

Method: PQK embeds classical data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space and uses kernel methods for similarity measurement, tested on a 61-qubit quantum computer.

Result: PQK enhances classification performance over classical methods, particularly for specific signaling domains with lower information.

Conclusion: Quantum computing shows promise for addressing data-constrained problems in CAR T-cell engineering.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

*Felix Kronenwett,Georg Maier,Thomas Laengle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian Optimization-based method for optimizing and adjusting process parameters in sensor-based sorting systems, using Gaussian process regression to minimize experiments and handle uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous verification and re-adjustment of process parameters are needed due to changing material stream compositions and requirements in sensor-based sorting systems.

Method: The approach uses Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian process regression models as surrogates to optimize process parameters, considering uncertainties and minimizing experiments.

Result: The method was evaluated with three example process parameters, successfully optimizing and adjusting parameters while handling uncertainties.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently optimizes and monitors process parameters in sensor-based sorting systems, reducing experimental effort and addressing uncertainties.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

### [172] [Teaching the Teacher: Improving Neural Network Distillability for Symbolic Regression via Jacobian Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22767)
*Soumyadeep Dhar,Kei Sen Fong,Mehul Motani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Jacobian-based regularizer improves symbolic distillation of neural networks, enhancing fidelity by 120% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current symbolic distillation of neural networks is brittle due to complex functions, leading to low-fidelity student models.

Method: Introduces a Jacobian-based regularizer to encourage smoother, more distillable functions in the teacher network.

Result: Improves the R² score of distilled symbolic models by 120% (relative) on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical way to enhance interpretable model fidelity from complex networks.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

### [173] [Label-free estimation of clinically relevant performance metrics under distribution shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22776)
*Tim Flühmann,Alceu Bissoto,Trung-Dung Hoang,Lisa M. Koch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to estimate the full confusion matrix for performance monitoring of image classification models in clinical settings, addressing limitations of existing accuracy-focused techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth labels are often unavailable in clinical datasets, making direct performance assessment infeasible. Existing methods focus on accuracy estimation but lack evaluation in clinical domains with class imbalances and dataset shifts.

Method: The authors generalize existing performance prediction methods to estimate the full confusion matrix and benchmark them on chest x-ray data under real-world and simulated distribution shifts.

Result: The proposed methods reliably predicted clinically relevant metrics under distribution shifts but revealed failure modes in simulated scenarios, highlighting the need for better understanding of deployment contexts.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of refining performance monitoring techniques for medical AI models, particularly in real-world clinical deployment with distribution shifts.

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

### [174] [DO-EM: Density Operator Expectation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22786)
*Adit Vishnu,Abhay Shastry,Dhruva Kashyap,Chiranjib Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework for training latent variable models using density operators (DOMs) on classical hardware, addressing scalability issues in quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum training algorithms, like those for Quantum Boltzmann Machines, lack scalability for real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST). The paper aims to bridge this gap by adapting classical EM methods to quantum settings.

Method: The authors reformulate the EM algorithm for DOMs, replacing the classical Expectation step with a quantum information projection (QIP) problem solved using the Petz Recovery Map. They introduce the DO-EM algorithm, an iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure optimizing a quantum evidence lower bound.

Result: The DO-EM algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood and scales to real-world data. The proposed Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (QiDBMs) trained with DO-EM outperform classical DBMs on MNIST, reducing Fréchet Inception Distance by 40–60%.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that DOMs can be trained efficiently on classical hardware, achieving superior performance in generative tasks compared to classical models, while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Core is a scalable RLHF training framework addressing challenges like controller scalability and resource placement in complex workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF systems struggle with scalability and adaptability in multi-modal and dynamic workloads.

Method: G-Core introduces a parallel controller model and dynamic resource placement for efficient orchestration.

Result: Successfully trained models for WeChat, improving hardware utilization and reducing idle time.

Conclusion: G-Core advances RLHF training, offering a robust solution for large-scale human-aligned models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

*Michael C. Burkhart,Bashar Ramadan,Luke Solo,William F. Parker,Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A foundation model-derived method identifies informative tokens and events in EHRs, improving anomaly detection and prediction of patient outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the identification of significant events in EHRs beyond rule-based methods, improving patient outcome predictions.

Method: Uses a foundation model to analyze EHR data in full hospitalization context, flagging anomalies and assessing event informativeness.

Result: Identifies significant events for outcome prediction and safely drops low-information events. Also aids in interpreting prognostic model predictions.

Conclusion: The method improves EHR analysis by leveraging foundation models for better anomaly detection, outcome prediction, and model interpretability.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative
tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming
data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag
anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal
range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for
predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLU networks implicitly learn a linear model, and its decision boundary can be approximated and pulled back to input space using modified backward passes, revealing interpretable patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover interpretable patterns learned by neural networks and demonstrate their potential for knowledge discovery and dependable AI systems.

Method: Formally describe the implicit linear model in ReLU networks and modify the backward pass to pull its decision boundary back to input space, generating excitation pullbacks.

Result: Excitation pullbacks reveal high-resolution, perceptually aligned features in ImageNet-pretrained architectures, indicating reliance on interpretable patterns.

Conclusion: Neural networks rely on interpretable patterns recoverable post-training, with significant implications for AI dependability and knowledge discovery.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAF-Net is a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework addressing challenges in multi-process manufacturing, outperforming baselines with lower MSE and MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is hindered by time-lagged interactions, overlapping operations, and inter-process dependencies.

Method: PAF-Net uses phase-correlation alignment, frequency independent patch attention, and frequency decoupled cross attention to address these challenges.

Result: PAF-Net achieves 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88% lower MAE than 10 baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: PAF-Net effectively resolves manufacturing prediction challenges and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

*Zijing Zhang,Ziyang Chen,Mingxiao Li,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVMR integrates process-level supervision into RL to improve reasoning quality in autonomous agents, achieving state-of-the-art results on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods reinforce flawed reasoning paths, leading to brittle agents. RLVMR aims to enhance reasoning coherence and generalization.

Method: RLVMR uses dense, process-level supervision, rewarding meta-reasoning behaviors like planning and reflection, combined with outcome signals and critic-free policy gradients.

Result: Achieves 83.6% success rate on unseen tasks, with reduced redundant actions and better error recovery.

Conclusion: RLVMR produces more robust, efficient, and interpretable agents by improving reasoning quality.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

*Andrew Campbell,Anna Scaglione,Sean Peisert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized, differentially private method (D-DP-PM) for PCA in multi-agent networks, ensuring privacy while estimating global eigenvectors without a central aggregator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of PCA in settings where agents observe only partial data dimensions, while ensuring privacy and collaboration.

Method: Agents share local embeddings with Gaussian noise, leveraging random initialization for privacy. The method guarantees (ε,δ)-DP and analyzes network topology impact.

Result: Proven privacy guarantees and convergence rates. Experiments show superior privacy-utility tradeoffs, especially for moderate privacy (ε∈[2,5]).

Conclusion: D-DP-PM offers efficient, privacy-preserving PCA in decentralized settings, balancing privacy and utility effectively.

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite- and infinite-horizon MDPs, leveraging hybrid exploration-generative RL. Quantum algorithms achieve logarithmic regret in finite-horizon MDPs, breaking classical limits, and propose a novel regret measure for infinite-horizon MDPs with exponential quantum advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve regret bounds in RL by avoiding traditional paradigms like optimism and posterior sampling, and leveraging quantum advantages for better performance.

Method: Hybrid exploration-generative RL model with classical and quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model.

Result: Quantum algorithms achieve logarithmic regret in finite-horizon MDPs and propose a novel regret measure for infinite-horizon MDPs with exponential quantum advantage. Classical algorithms also show improved bounds.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates significant improvements in regret bounds for MDPs using quantum algorithms, with potential extensions to compact state spaces.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes RecPS, a privacy scoring method for recommender systems, using membership-inference attacks to quantify privacy risks at interaction and user levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users should have the right to control sharing sensitive interactions, but current systems lack methods to identify such risks.

Method: RecPS uses a membership-inference attack (RecLiRA) to derive privacy scores, inspired by differential privacy.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate RecPS's effectiveness in risk assessment and model unlearning.

Conclusion: RecPS provides a practical tool for privacy-aware recommender system development and deployment.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GeoOutageKG integrates high-resolution satellite data and county-level outage reports to improve power outage detection and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outage data lacks spatial resolution, while satellite data lacks temporal granularity. Combining these can enhance outage assessment.

Method: Constructs a multimodal knowledge graph (GeoOutageKG) by aligning diverse data sources (satellite images, outage maps, time-series reports) with an ontology (GeoOutageOnto).

Result: GeoOutageKG includes 10.6M outage records, 300K satellite images, and 15K outage maps, enabling robust multimodal analysis.

Conclusion: GeoOutageKG is a reusable semantic resource that improves geospatiotemporal outage analysis.

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and
reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We
demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power
outages.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RecGPT is a next-gen recommender system framework using LLMs to focus on user intent, improving diversity and satisfaction while benefiting all stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems overfit to historical data, reinforcing filter bubbles and harming user experience. RecGPT aims to address this by modeling user intent.

Method: RecGPT integrates LLMs into user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, using a multi-stage training paradigm with reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training.

Result: Deployed on Taobao, RecGPT boosts content diversity, user satisfaction, and merchant exposure, showing consistent performance gains.

Conclusion: LLM-driven, intent-centric design fosters a sustainable and mutually beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial
intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants,
and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant
on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually
beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

### [185] [Multi-modal Relational Item Representation Learning for Inferring Substitutable and Complementary Items](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22268)
*Junting Wang,Chenghuan Guo,Jiao Yang,Yanhui Guo,Yan Gao,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MMSC is a self-supervised multi-modal framework for learning item representations, addressing noisy user behavior and data sparsity, outperforming baselines by 26.1% (substitutable) and 39.2% (complementary).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook noisy user behavior and data sparsity, limiting their effectiveness in modeling item relationships.

Method: MMSC combines multi-modal item representation, self-supervised behavior learning, and hierarchical aggregation, augmented by LLMs for training data.

Result: MMSC outperforms baselines significantly and effectively models cold-start items.

Conclusion: MMSC addresses key challenges in item representation learning and demonstrates superior performance in real-world datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item
representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and
complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item
associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or
leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook
critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to
the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose
MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning
framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three
main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that
leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a
self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and
learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation
aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic
and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training
data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct
extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC
outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and
39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that
MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.

*Jayanth Yetukuri,Ishita Khan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a data pipeline for mining buyer intent from query logs to improve e-commerce search systems, using sequence mining and supervised learning to enhance query reformulation and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding buyer intent in e-commerce search systems, aiming to improve query reformulation by leveraging intent signals.

Method: Develops a robust data pipeline using sequence mining and supervised learning to extract intent signals from query logs, enabling intent-aware query reformulation.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved relevance metrics, validating the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation.

Conclusion: Intent-centric modeling bridges the gap between user inputs and product discovery, providing a scalable foundation for future research in neural retrieval systems.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in
optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of
e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed
to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting
fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit
behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised
learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of
latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity,
intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of
adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user
intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query
rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and
downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product
verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight
the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user
inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation
for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

TL;DR: A decentralised, asynchronous ADMM algorithm for nonconvex optimisation, proven to converge, is applied to Phase Retrieval and sparse PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of decentralised, asynchronous methods for nonconvex optimisation with proven convergence.

Method: Develops an ADMM algorithm based on Randomised Block Coordinate Douglas-Rachford splitting for distributed, asynchronous computation.

Result: First decentralised, asynchronous algorithm for nonconvex problems with convergence proof; demonstrated efficiency in Phase Retrieval and sparse PCA.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively solves nonconvex decentralised optimisation problems with theoretical and practical validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex decentralised optimisation and learning
over a network of distributed agents. We develop an ADMM algorithm based on the
Randomised Block Coordinate Douglas-Rachford splitting method which enables
agents in the network to distributedly and asynchronously compute a set of
first-order stationary solutions of the problem. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first decentralised and asynchronous algorithm for solving
nonconvex optimisation problems with convergence proof. The numerical examples
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for distributed Phase
Retrieval and sparse Principal Component Analysis problems.

### [188] [Set Invariance with Probability One for Controlled Diffusion: Score-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22385)
*Wenqing Wang,Alexis M. H. Teter,Murat Arcak,Abhishek Halder*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring controlled set invariance in a diffusion process, using score-based tests for finite and infinite time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when a controlled diffusion can guarantee set invariance with probability one, addressing gaps in understanding Markovian controllers for such problems.

Method: The study uses gradients of log-likelihoods (score vector fields) to formulate tests, solving Dirichlet boundary value problems for verification.

Result: The proposed score-based test certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers, with constructive characterization of valid controllers when conditions are met.

Conclusion: The results provide a rigorous framework for verifying set invariance in controlled diffusions, with practical applications demonstrated through examples.

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is
it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In
this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods --
a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and
infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that
provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for
given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in
the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all
controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data
fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish
the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the
proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and
in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of
hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using
several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

### [189] [Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds: A Gradient-Free Projection-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22855)
*Hongye Wang,Zhaoye Pan,Chang He,Jiaxiang Li,Bo Jiang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Proposes a zeroth-order projection-based algorithm for federated learning (FL) on Riemannian manifolds, addressing challenges of noisy evaluations and constrained parameters. The method uses a computationally efficient gradient estimator and demonstrates sublinear convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL algorithms are limited to unconstrained optimization with exact gradients, restricting their use in scenarios with noisy evaluations or constrained parameters.

Method: Introduces a zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator using a projection operator, requiring only Euclidean random perturbations. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed and numerically tested.

Result: The estimator is proven to approximate gradients well, and the algorithm achieves sublinear convergence. Numerical tests validate its efficiency in real-world applications like zeroth-order attacks and low-rank training.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm extends FL's applicability to constrained and noisy scenarios, offering a computationally efficient solution with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

### [190] [Dimensions of Vulnerability in Visual Working Memory: An AI-Driven Approach to Perceptual Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22067)
*Yuang Cao,Jiachen Zou,Chen Wei,Quanying Liu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: An AI-driven framework studies memory distortions in visual working memory (VWM) using naturalistic stimuli, revealing that visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how perceptual comparison affects memory distortions in real-world objects and identify contributing visual features.

Method: Uses AI-generated stimuli (image and dimension wheels) in three VWM experiments under varying comparison conditions.

Result: Similar dimensions, like images, induce memory distortions; visual dimensions are more vulnerable than semantic ones.

Conclusion: Naturalistic visual stimuli's object dimensions significantly influence memory vulnerability, with visual features being more distortion-prone.

Abstract: Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily
life. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,
during cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous
studies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual
comparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory
distortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying
what visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel
research question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates
naturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions
to elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --
image wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated
by dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)
experiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three
conditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,
and perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar
dimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.
Specifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic
dimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual
stimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.

### [191] [Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22216)
*Andrew Kyle Lampinen,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Yuxuan Li,Katherine Hermann*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses biases in neural and computational model representations, highlighting challenges in representational analysis and implications for neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in learned feature representations and their impact on understanding systems through representational analysis.

Method: Illustrates challenges using examples like PCA, regression, and RSA, and presents homomorphic encryption as a case study.

Result: Shows how feature representation biases can lead to biased inferences and dissociations between representation and computation.

Conclusion: Highlights implications for representational comparisons in neuroscience and the need to account for biases in analyses.

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a
means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural
representations to the internal representations learned by computational
models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that
learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain
features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example,
simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented
than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges
for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis.
In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature
representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common
analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption
as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between
patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of
these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for
neuroscience more generally.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study identifies EEG-based neural signatures of affective semantic processing in depression and suicidality, showing altered dynamics compared to healthy controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover objective neurophysiological biomarkers for depression and suicidality by analyzing neural dynamics during affective semantic processing.

Method: Multivariate decoding of EEG data from 137 participants performing a sentence evaluation task with emotionally charged self-referential statements.

Result: Clinical groups showed earlier, longer, and stronger neural responses, with broader cross-temporal generalization and heightened frontocentral/parietotemporal activation.

Conclusion: Depression and suicidality involve altered sensitivity to emotional content, offering insights for EEG-based biomarker development.

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

### [193] [A Mean-Field Theory of $Θ$-Expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22577)
*Qian Qi*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper develops a stochastic calculus for non-convex uncertainty models, introducing Mean-Field Forward-Backward SDEs with a non-convex driver. It ensures well-posedness via strong concavity and proves dynamic consistency for the resulting valuation functional, which violates sub-additivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations ignores non-convex geometry in uncertainty models. This work addresses this gap by developing a calculus for structured non-convex models.

Method: Introduces fully coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward SDEs with a non-convex driver, using strong concavity for tractability. Proves Lipschitz stability and well-posedness.

Result: Establishes local and global well-posedness for the FBSDE system. The resulting Θ-Expectation is dynamically consistent but violates sub-additivity and translation invariance.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for stochastic calculus under non-convex ambiguity, departing from the convex paradigm.

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic
calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of
primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for
a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully
coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the
BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent,
non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong
concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which
ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central
contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from
primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire
well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for
the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation,
is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the
axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation
invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm.
This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class
of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust state-space model using the asymmetric Laplace distribution to handle outlier data with skewness and heavy tails, offering efficient variational Bayes and parameter estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-space models struggle with non-Gaussian outlier data, requiring manual tuning and specific noise conditions.

Method: Proposes a variational Bayes algorithm and a single-loop parameter estimation strategy for efficient filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance across noise settings without hyperparameter tuning, using fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: The model is effective for practical applications like robust control and financial modeling, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

TL;DR: A low-cost radar-based method for human motion direction determination (HMDD) is proposed, combining feature augmentation and a hybrid Vision Transformer-CNN model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining human motion direction aids tasks like gait recognition, but current Doppler-Time map (DTM) methods lack simultaneous feature augmentation and motion determination.

Method: Generates gait DTMs, uses a feature linking model for augmentation, and implements HMDD with a lightweight Vision Transformer-CNN hybrid.

Result: Validated on an open-source dataset, showing effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method is accurate, low-cost, and open-sourced for further use.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

Motivation: To understand the distributional properties of Bayesian deep neural networks with dependent weights, especially in the wide-width limit and shallow cases.

Method: Theoretical analysis of posterior Bayesian networks with dependent weights, focusing on Gaussian likelihoods. Derives the wide-width limit distribution and provides a sampling algorithm. Explicitly computes the output distribution for shallow networks.

Result: For Gaussian likelihoods, the wide-width limit distribution is identified, and a sampling algorithm is provided. In shallow networks, the output is proven to be a Gaussian mixture. Numerical validation supports the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The study successfully characterizes the distribution of Bayesian deep neural networks with dependent weights, offering theoretical insights and practical sampling methods, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward
deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is
Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an

the distribution of the output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the

*Tavor Z. Baharav,Phillip B. Nicol,Rafael A. Irizarry,Rong Ma*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper compares two methods (Stack-SVD and SVD-Stack) for identifying shared latent structure in high-dimensional datasets, derives their asymptotic performance, and introduces optimal weighting schemes to improve them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data analysis needs robust methods to identify shared latent structures across datasets, but existing methods lack theoretical understanding in proportional asymptotic regimes.

Method: The study derives exact asymptotic expressions for Stack-SVD and SVD-Stack, develops optimal weighting schemes, and extends analysis to multiple shared components.

Result: Optimally weighted Stack-SVD outperforms SVD-Stack, and practical algorithms for weight estimation are provided.

Conclusion: The paper offers theoretical guidance for method selection in data integration, supported by simulations and genomic data experiments.

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent
structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model
assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with
a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for
estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information
across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the
datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second
approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,
then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally
computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they
have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which
is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and
dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty
about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their
potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the
asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop
optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals
that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,
optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend
our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical
algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical
guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive
numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

*Xiaodong Feng,Ling Guo,Xiaoliang Wan,Hao Wu,Tao Zhou,Wenwen Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: LVM-GP is a probabilistic framework for uncertainty-aware PDE solving, combining a latent Gaussian process with a neural operator for accurate predictions and robust uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty quantification in PDEs with noisy data, leveraging stochastic mappings and physical constraints for reliable solutions.

Method: Uses a confidence-aware encoder (LVM-GP) and probabilistic decoder, integrating Gaussian processes and neural operators, with physical laws as soft constraints.

Result: Outperforms B-PINNs and deep ensembles in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: LVM-GP effectively merges stochastic and deterministic methods for robust PDE solutions, demonstrating reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty
quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations
(PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from
the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling
uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture
consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder
implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process
(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating
between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with
the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function
learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over
the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to
the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible
function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft
constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE
structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed
neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can
efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian
process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and
robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of domain adaptation algorithms, focusing on domain alignment in semi-supervised settings, and derives generalization bounds and sample complexity for neural networks using MMD or adversarial objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in theoretical understanding of domain adaptation, especially for modern approaches that align domains via feature transformations.

Method: The study derives generalization bounds and analyzes sample complexity for domain-adaptive neural networks with MMD or adversarial objectives, using covering numbers of function classes.

Result: Sample complexity scales quadratically with network depth and width, and robustness in semi-supervised settings is achievable by scaling the target loss proportionally to the square root of labeled target samples.

Conclusion: The theoretical findings are supported by experiments, providing insights into the behavior and scalability of domain adaptation algorithms.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a
source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with
limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development,
its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing
theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target
domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to
measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not
fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a
shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain
alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature
transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first
derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers
of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize
the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous
analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both
MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound
that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our
analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited
labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally
to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental
evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical
findings.

*Biyi Fang,Jean Utke,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel framework integrates dynamic feature selection with BoostCNN principles to enhance CNN performance, reducing manual tuning and improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are computationally expensive and require extensive manual tuning for optimal architectures.

Method: Uses subgrid selection and importance sampling, embedding boosting weights into training via least squares loss.

Result: Boosted CNN variants outperform conventional CNNs in accuracy and training speed on fine-grained benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces manual design effort while improving CNN performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature
learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and
millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,
requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that
integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our
approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance
sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We
further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly
into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This
integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but
also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several
fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN
variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive
performance and training speed.

TL;DR: The paper explores SHAP for interpretability in multi-view deep learning models for multi-omics data, finding feature rankings sensitive to architecture and initialization. It proposes a robustness assessment method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in interpretability of machine/deep learning models in biological research, particularly for identifying biomolecules of interest.

Method: Uses SHAP on multi-view deep learning models with multi-omics data, comparing feature rankings across architectures and assessing robustness via computational experiments.

Result: SHAP rankings are sensitive to architecture and weight initialization, cautioning their use. An alternative method for robustness assessment is proposed.

Conclusion: SHAP's reliability for feature identification in multi-omics models is limited; a simpler robustness assessment method is suggested.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological
research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability
of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features
driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open
area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the
purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via
these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate
consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to
assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and
diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of
important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of
features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using
only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution
method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP
are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random
initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods
on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an
alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of
important biomolecules.

TL;DR: QPAudioEraser is a quantum-inspired framework for erasing individual-specific voice signatures from trained biometric models, ensuring privacy compliance with minimal impact on model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy vulnerabilities in voice-enabled authentication systems and comply with regulations like GDPR and India's DPDP Act by enabling efficient erasure of sensitive speech data.

Method: Uses a quantum-inspired approach: destructive interference for weight initialization, superposition-based label transformations, quantum loss function, and entanglement-inspired weight mixing.

Result: Achieves complete erasure (0% Forget Accuracy) with minimal performance degradation (0.05%) on retained data, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: QPAudioEraser is a robust solution for privacy-preserving audio unlearning, validated across multiple datasets and architectures.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric
systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with
sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right
to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient
erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric
models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately
handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,
leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address
this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning
framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using
destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based
label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an
uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired
mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech
Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate
QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure
of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model
utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%.
QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across
single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios,
establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Dragon-FM is a novel TTS model combining AR and flow-matching to address limitations of AR and diffusion models, enabling efficient high-quality audio generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models lack future context and are slow, while diffusion models struggle with KV caching. Dragon-FM aims to unify their strengths.

Method: Dragon-FM processes audio tokens in chunks, using AR for global coherence and flow-matching for fast denoising within chunks.

Result: The model efficiently generates high-quality 48 kHz audio, leveraging KV-cache and future context, as shown in podcast dataset experiments.

Conclusion: Dragon-FM bridges AR and diffusion models, offering fast, coherent, and high-quality text-to-speech generation.

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced
generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which
rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow
generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)
caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel
text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model
processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per
second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global
coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast
iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache
across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it
bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous
AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.
This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the
proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.
Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its
capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel duration prediction framework improves phoneme-level alignment in TTS models, enhancing accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the brittleness of autoregressive TTS alignments and reliance on external duration sources in non-autoregressive models.

Method: Proposes a duration prediction framework for precise phoneme-level duration distribution.

Result: 11.3% improvement in alignment accuracy and better robustness in zero-shot TTS.

Conclusion: The framework offers a more reliable solution for speech-to-text alignment in TTS models.

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech
(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to
learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle
and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading
to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models
rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration
models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction
framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with
given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise
prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline
models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment
accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the
mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Conclusion: aLLoyM accelerates materials discovery; publicly released for research and adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging
applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce
aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions,
temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we
curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams
using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and
assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned
Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats:
multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that
fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram
questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to
generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its
potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials
systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released
the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Scaling transformer models up to 110M parameters improves sEMG task performance and enables effective distillation into smaller models with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of small training data and computational constraints in sEMG research by exploring larger model scalability.

Method: Use vanilla transformer models scaled up to 110M parameters and distill them into smaller models (50x smaller).

Result: Larger models outperform smaller ones (<10M parameters) and can be distilled with <1.5% performance loss.

Conclusion: Scaled transformers enable efficient, high-performance sEMG models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for
developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into
muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and
computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation
of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we
demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on
sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters,
surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually
<10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively
distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5%
absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex
real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A noise-robust Voice Activity Detection (VAD) method is proposed, enhancing accuracy in noisy environments without increasing model size or requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate VAD is crucial for speech processing applications like voice assistants, especially in noisy AIoT devices, where existing models struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: The approach combines a light-weight VAD with data pre-processing and post-processing modules to handle background noise.

Result: The method significantly improves VAD accuracy in noisy environments and even enhances clean speech detection, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed noise-robust VAD is effective and practical for real-world applications with background noise.

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a
challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in
automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where
noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the
voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice
signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain
light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models
often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic
environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment,
but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a
noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing
and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach
significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires
neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly
in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD
additionally improving clean speech detection.

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper studies synchronization in a mean-field model of particles on a unit circle, extending the Kuramoto model. It proposes a general synchronization criterion and resolves a conjecture for self-attention dynamics, showing synchronization for β ≥ -0.16 and no synchronization for β < -2/3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the Kuramoto model and analyze synchronization conditions for interacting particles on a unit circle, particularly for self-attention dynamics.

Method: A mean-field model of particles on a unit circle is analyzed, with a synchronization criterion based on the L1-norm of the third derivative of the interaction function.

Result: Synchronization is proven for β ≥ -0.16, extending previous bounds, and shown not to occur for β < -2/3.

Conclusion: The proposed criterion successfully generalizes synchronization analysis, resolving a conjecture and expanding the understanding of synchronization in such models.

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper addresses scanner bias in computational pathology (CPath) caused by deep learning (DL) models, proposes ScanGen to mitigate it, and demonstrates improved generalization across scanners for EGFR mutation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scanner bias in CPath hinders clinical trust and deployment. The study aims to evaluate pathology Foundation Models (FMs) for scanner bias and propose a solution.

Method: Benchmarked FMs on a multi-scanner dataset, identified scanner bias, and introduced ScanGen, a contrastive loss function for fine-tuning to mitigate bias.

Result: ScanGen improved generalization across scanners while maintaining or enhancing EGFR mutation prediction performance.

Conclusion: ScanGen effectively reduces scanner bias in CPath, enhancing model robustness and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

*Matteo Giacomini,Antonio Huerta*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A surrogate-based topology optimization method for linear elastic structures under parametric loads is introduced, using a neural network to predict quasi-optimal topologies and refine them efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs and improve efficiency in topology optimization by leveraging surrogate models and neural networks.

Method: Uses a feed-forward net to map input parameters to a latent space, predicts quasi-optimal topologies, and refines them with a penalization algorithm.

Result: Reduces optimization iterations by 53% with discrepancies below 4% in objective functional values, even outside training domains.

Conclusion: The method efficiently combines surrogate modeling and refinement, outperforming traditional high-fidelity optimizers.

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

Motivation: Accurate sensor node localization is crucial for IoT applications, requiring robust methods adaptable to diverse environments.

Method: The hybrid algorithm integrates SCA (global search) and PSO (local search) with an adaptive switching module, optimized for node localization.

Result: Simulations show significant reduction in iterations and 84.97% lower average localization error compared to standalone PSO and unoptimized SCAPSO.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid algorithm effectively improves localization accuracy and efficiency for IoT applications.

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Motivation: Modern environments lack coherent spatial representations, making tasks like access policy enforcement fragile and manual.

Method: Proposes a bigraph-based unifying representation and a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning.

Result: Enables private, reliable, and low-latency spatial networking that integrates safely with agentic workflows.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust solution for spatial reasoning in networked environments.

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Motivation: To develop safe and efficient control strategies for chemical processes using historical data, avoiding the risks and costs of online experimentation.

Method: A Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment models reactor dynamics. Baseline algorithms (behaviour cloning, implicit Q-learning) are tested, and a safety layer with input convex neural networks (PICNNs) corrects actions.

Result: Offline RL with convex action correction outperforms traditional control methods, maintaining stability across scenarios.

Conclusion: Offline RL with safety-aware corrections is feasible for high-stakes chemical process control, paving the way for reliable data-driven automation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Motivation: Neural networks in safety-critical systems require infinite-time horizon safety verification, but existing methods ignore finite-precision roundoff errors.

Result: The approach is evaluated on automotive and aeronautics case studies, yielding efficient NN implementations with rigorous safety guarantees.

Conclusion: The work bridges theory and practice by ensuring safety under finite-precision perturbations, providing end-to-end solutions for NNCSs.

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A systematic method for evaluating knowledge graph repairs using SHACL constraints, introducing violation-inducing operations (VIOs) and testing repair systems built with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for knowledge graph repairs rely on ad hoc datasets, limiting rigorous analysis in general settings.

Method: Proposes a framework using VIOs to generate violations systematically and evaluates repair systems built with large language models, testing various prompting strategies.

Result: Concise prompts with violated SHACL constraints and contextual knowledge graph information perform best.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust way to evaluate repair systems, with optimal performance achieved through specific prompting strategies.

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general
settings. Our method addresses this gap by systematically generating violations
using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

### [217] [RedCoder: Automated Multi-Turn Red Teaming for Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22063)
*Wenjie Jacky Mo,Qin Liu,Xiaofei Wen,Dongwon Jung,Hadi Askari,Wenxuan Zhou,Zhe Zhao,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RedCoder is a red-teaming agent designed to elicit vulnerable code from Code LLMs through multi-turn conversations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming approaches for Code LLMs are limited by human effort and overlook multi-turn interactions, prompting the need for a scalable solution.

Method: RedCoder is built via a multi-agent gaming process to simulate adversarial interactions, fine-tuned on prototype conversations, and dynamically retrieves attack strategies.

Result: RedCoder outperforms prior methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation across multiple Code LLMs.

Conclusion: RedCoder provides a scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security of code-generation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RandLuzz uses LLMs to reduce randomness in fuzzing by generating targeted seeds and bug-specific mutators, improving efficiency in bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomness in fuzzing reduces efficiency; directed fuzzing still struggles with randomness in seeds and mutators.

Method: Integrates LLMs to generate reachable seeds and bug-specific mutators, analyzing function call chains and bug causes.

Result: Achieves speedups of 2.1× to 4.8× compared to initial seeds and exposes 8 bugs within 60 seconds.

Conclusion: RandLuzz enhances fuzzing efficiency by leveraging LLMs to minimize randomness and target bugs effectively.

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

### [220] [CodeEvo: Interaction-Driven Synthesis of Code-centric Data through Hybrid and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22080)
*Qiushi Sun,Jinyang Gong,Lei Li,Qipeng Guo,Fei Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeEvo is a framework for synthesizing high-quality instruction-code pairs using two LLM agents (Coder and Reviewer) with hybrid feedback, outperforming baselines in code generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curation of instruction-code pairs is costly and limited, while existing synthesis methods lack rigorous validation, leading to poor-quality data.

Method: CodeEvo uses iterative interactions between a Coder (generates code/test cases) and a Reviewer (provides instructions/feedback), with hybrid feedback for quality control.

Result: Models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data outperform baselines in code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeEvo provides an effective, validated approach for code-centric data synthesis, improving LLM performance in code generation.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TypyBench evaluates LLMs' type inference in Python, revealing decent TypeSim scores but struggles with complex nested types and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored type inference capabilities of LLMs in dynamic languages like Python.

Method: Introduces TypyBench with TypeSim and TypeCheck metrics, evaluating LLMs on 50 Python repositories.

Result: LLMs achieve decent TypeSim but struggle with complex nested types and type consistency.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on repository-level consistency; TypyBench provides a foundation for this direction.

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs can generate code from scientific paper descriptions, potentially replacing human-maintained software packages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce costs and overhead of maintaining software packages by leveraging LLMs for on-demand code generation.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) to implement core algorithms from scientific papers.

Result: LLMs reliably reproduce package functionality with performance matching conventional libraries.

Conclusion: A shift toward on-demand code generation using LLMs could reduce maintenance overhead by replacing static, human-maintained packages.

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RePaCA, a static APCA technique using LLMs, improves patch correctness assessment with high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static APCA techniques lack reliability, flexibility, and transparency in identifying overfitting patches.

Method: RePaCA leverages LLMs to analyze code differences and reason about patch correctness, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Achieves 83.1% accuracy and 84.8% F1-score on Defects4J, with superior generalization and explainability.

Conclusion: Finetuned LLMs show promise for advancing static APCA by improving accuracy, generalization, and transparency.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the high accuracy of deep-code models in tasks like code completion and defect detection, their robustness under varied conditions (e.g., adversarial inputs) remains a concern. Metamorphic testing is a key approach to evaluate this robustness.

Method: A systematic literature review of 45 primary papers, focusing on transformations, techniques, and evaluation methods for metamorphic testing of deep code models.

Result: The review summarizes current practices, including frequently evaluated models, programming tasks, datasets, languages, and metrics, while identifying challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: Metamorphic testing is crucial for ensuring the robustness of deep-code models, and the review provides insights into current trends and areas for further research.

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Motivation: The fragmented research landscape in LLM-based vulnerability detection lacks comparability due to diverse system designs and dataset usage, necessitating a structured overview.

Method: Conducted an SLR of 227 studies (2020-2025), categorizing by task formulation, input representation, system architecture, adaptation techniques, and dataset analysis.

Result: Developed a taxonomy of approaches, identified limitations, and outlined future research opportunities, with publicly released artifacts and a living repository.

Conclusion: The review provides a structured guide for researchers and practitioners, enhancing transparency and reproducibility in LLM-based vulnerability detection research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach for autonomous systems to incorporate user ethical preferences through ethics-based negotiation, demonstrated via RobEthiChor-Ros in ROS with successful experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems lack the ability to incorporate individual ethical preferences, reducing user trust and alignment with moral beliefs. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling ethics-based negotiation among such systems.

Method: RobEthiChor provides a domain-agnostic reference architecture and an implementation (RobEthiChor-Ros) in ROS for ethics-based negotiation. Experiments involved deploying it on robots for resource contention scenarios.

Result: RobEthiChor-Ros achieved agreements in over 73% of scenarios with an average negotiation time of 0.67s, demonstrating feasibility, effectiveness, and scalability.

Conclusion: RobEthiChor successfully enables autonomous systems to negotiate ethically, enhancing trust and alignment with user preferences, as validated by real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

*Haichuan Hu,Xiaochen Xie,Quanjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Repair-R1 integrates test cases into the training phase and prioritizes test generation before repair, improving APR effectiveness with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based APR methods underutilize test cases in training and repair phases, missing opportunities to enhance defect understanding and repair accuracy.

Method: Repair-R1 introduces test cases during training and requires test generation before repair, using RL to co-optimize both tasks.

Result: Repair-R1 outperforms vanilla models, increasing repair success by 2.68% to 48.29%, test generation success by 16.38% to 53.28%, and test coverage by 0.78% to 53.96%.

Conclusion: Repair-R1 demonstrates the benefits of integrating test cases early in APR, significantly improving repair and test generation performance.

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to simulate unsafe online conversations (e.g., scams) to educate users by providing feedback on hypothetical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI like LLMs can amplify unsafe online conversations, making it easier for bad actors. The study aims to promote online safety by educating users about such risks.

Method: Simulates scam conversations using two LLMs (scammer and target), then asks users to provide feedback to the target LLM.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to create realistic unsafe conversations for educational purposes.

Conclusion: LLM-based simulations can effectively teach users about online safety by engaging them in feedback-driven learning.

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe
conversations online. LLMs lower the barrier for entry for bad actors to create
unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system
are asked provide feedback to the target LLM.

*Sami Saeed Alghamdi,Christopher Bull,Ahmed Kharrufa*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A system combining a web platform and browser extensions was developed to support self-regulation in online programming learning, using AI-generated feedback and storytelling. User feedback indicated its viability, with mixed views on features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent learners of programming face isolation, frustration, and information overload, while social media serves as a space for self-regulation practices. The system aims to structure learning experiences and enhance reflection.

Method: Developed a web platform and browser extensions with AI-generated feedback to support self-regulation. Conducted a study with 15 informal programming learners, using surveys to assess perceptions.

Result: Learners valued in-situ reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, though other features received mixed reviews. The system was deemed viable for aiding self-regulation.

Conclusion: The system shows promise for supporting self-regulation in online learning, with identified benefits and areas for improvement in future AI-augmented tools.

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework automates margin line detection for dental crowns, improving consistency and accuracy over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual margin line definition in dental crown design is inconsistent and non-repeatable, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: A modified mesh-based neural network segments teeth, followed by k-fold cross-validation, voting classifiers, and graph cut optimization to refine results.

Result: The ensemble model achieved 7 successful test cases out of 13, with better preparation quality reducing prediction divergence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a reliable, automated alternative to manual margin line detection, with potential for improved dental crown design.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

### [231] [Physics-constrained generative machine learning-based high-resolution downscaling of Greenland's surface mass balance and surface temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22485)
*Nils Bochow,Philipp Hess,Alexander Robinson*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: A physics-constrained generative model (CM) is introduced to downscale Greenland ice sheet SMB and temperature data efficiently, outperforming interpolation methods and enabling high-resolution climate projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for projecting Greenland ice sheet SMB and temperature are either computationally intensive or limited to coarse scales, hindering accurate sea-level rise predictions.

Method: The CM downscales low-resolution data (160 km to 5 km) using MARv3.12 outputs, conditioned on topography and insolation, with enforced conservation constraints.

Result: The CM achieves superior performance (6.31 mmWE for SMB, 0.1 K for temperature) and reproduces spatial variability, validated with bias-corrected NorESM2 inputs.

Conclusion: The CM provides fast, high-resolution climate forcing for ice-sheet models, improving future sea-level rise projections from Greenland and other ice sheets.

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface
mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding
future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: TrustTrack is a protocol embedding verifiable identity, policy commitments, and tamper-resistant logs into LLM-powered autonomous agents, enabling trust-native autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLM-powered agents in high-stakes domains necessitates verifiability and trust, moving beyond just intelligence.

Method: TrustTrack introduces structural guarantees (identity, policy, logs) into agent infrastructure, treating compliance as a design constraint.

Result: The protocol enables trust-native autonomy, with use cases in regulated domains like pharmaceuticals and legal workflows.

Conclusion: TrustTrack represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems, transitioning from Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

Conclusion: LLMs can simulate core human social dynamics, with model scale and reasoning capabilities influencing outcomes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models offer promising capabilities to
simulate complex human social interactions. We investigate whether LLM-based
multi-agent simulations can reproduce core human social dynamics observed in

fragmentation across different model scales and reasoning capabilities using a
structured simulation framework. Our findings indicate that smaller models
exhibit higher conformity rates, whereas models optimized for reasoning are

### [234] [GABRIL: Gaze-Based Regularization for Mitigating Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19647)
*Amin Banayeeanzade,Fatemeh Bahrani,Yutai Zhou,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GABRIL improves Imitation Learning by using human gaze data to focus on causally relevant features, reducing causal confusion and boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation Learning often suffers from causal confusion due to spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization.

Method: GABRIL introduces gaze-based regularization to guide representation learning, emphasizing causally relevant features from expert gaze data.

Result: GABRIL outperforms baselines by 179% in Atari and 76% in CARLA, while also enhancing explainability.

Conclusion: GABRIL effectively mitigates causal confusion in IL, improving performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

*Yifei Chen,Yuzhe Zhang,Giovanni D'urso,Nicholas Lawrance,Brendan Tidd*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal structure learning framework to improve generalization in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, addressing limitations of current methods under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning techniques struggle with generalization under minor domain shifts, limiting their effectiveness in robotic manipulation.

Method: The authors propose learning causal relationships between observation components and expert actions using a simple causal structure learning framework, integrated into existing architectures like Action Chunking Transformer.

Result: The method, tested on ALOHA bimanual robot arms in Mujoco, significantly mitigates generalization issues in complex imitation learning.

Conclusion: The proposed causal learning framework enhances generalization in imitation learning, offering a practical solution for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

### [236] [Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22429)
*Erwin de Gelder,Maren Buermann,Olaf Op den Camp*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating Probability Density Functions (PDFs) in scenario-based safety validation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs), showing NF's advantages over Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in handling high-dimensional data and improving risk uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety validation of ADSs requires accurate exposure estimation of real-world traffic scenarios. Traditional methods like KDE face limitations due to assumptions or oversimplification, prompting the need for flexible, high-dimensional density estimation techniques like NF.

Method: The paper employs Normalizing Flows (NF), a generative model that transforms simple distributions into complex ones using invertible mappings, enabling flexible PDF estimation without restrictive assumptions. NF's performance is compared to KDE.

Result: NF outperforms KDE in handling high-dimensional data and improving risk uncertainty estimation, though it requires more computational resources. This leads to more precise safety assessments for ADSs.

Conclusion: NF shows promise for scenario-based safety validation. Future work includes optimizing NF for scenario generation and refining its architecture and training to enhance applicability.

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

*Yassine Rachidy,Jihad Rbaiti,Youssef Hmamouche,Faissal Sehbaoui,Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SDeflection is a defense strategy for LLMs that neutralizes jailbreaking attacks by redirecting harmful queries to semantically adjacent but safe responses, reducing attack success without compromising benign performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in critical applications necessitates robust defenses against advanced jailbreaking attacks, which bypass traditional refusal-based safeguards.

Method: SDeflection redefines LLM responses to logit-level attacks by generating semantically adjacent answers that strip harmful intent, instead of outright refusal.

Result: Experiments show SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining performance on benign queries.

Conclusion: SDeflection represents a shift from refusal-based defenses to strategic content redirection, effectively neutralizing advanced threats.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas,
ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While
traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent
logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by
directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We
introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the
LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model
produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet
strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful
intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers
Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign
queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving
from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced
threats.

TL;DR: The paper explores how persona prompts can bypass LLM safety mechanisms, using a genetic algorithm to craft effective prompts, reducing refusal rates by 50-70% and boosting attack success when combined with other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating jailbreak attacks on LLMs is critical for improving their safety, especially given the understudied role of persona prompts in such attacks.

Method: A genetic algorithm is used to automatically generate persona prompts that evade LLM safety mechanisms.

Result: Evolved persona prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% and increase attack success rates by 10-20% when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Persona prompts are highly effective in bypassing LLM defenses, highlighting a significant vulnerability that needs addressing for safer LLMs.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) by inducing
them to generate harmful content, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities.
Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field
of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct
manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of
persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of
persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic
algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass
LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona
prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these
prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack
methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize attack generator prompts for LLMs by measuring attack discoverability through repeated attacks, improving robustness in evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying vulnerabilities in LLM-based systems is critical due to their widespread use, and automated red teaming accelerates this process.

Method: The method involves repeating attacks multiple times against randomly seeded targets to measure discoverability (expectation of attack success) and optimize prompts.

Result: The approach reveals exploitable patterns, enabling better prompt optimization and robust evaluation of attack generators.

Conclusion: This method enhances the refinement and evaluation of attack generators, improving vulnerability identification in LLM systems.

Abstract: Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread,
making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important.
Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and
execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using
the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of
success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing
attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating
each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an
attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This
approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization,
ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining ML-based attack detection with LLM-generated explanations achieves high accuracy and interpretability for smart grid cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitization of smart grids introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities like FDIAs, and while ML/DL models detect attacks, their opacity limits trust and applicability.

Method: The framework uses LightGBM for attack detection (95.13% accuracy, 0.004s latency) and LLMs (GPT variants) for generating human-readable explanations.

Result: GPT-4o mini achieved 93% accuracy in attack target identification, 0.075 pu MAE in magnitude estimation, and 2.19s MAE in onset estimation.

Conclusion: The framework balances real-time detection with interpretable explanations, meeting the need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational
efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC)
systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown
promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator
trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that
integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language
explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as
LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s
inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs,
including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate
human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o
mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack
target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and
2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These
results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time
detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical
need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

TL;DR: SAEL is an LLM-based framework for smart contract vulnerability detection, combining targeted prompts, prompt-tuning, and an Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts architecture to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static analysis and specialized pre-trained models in smart contract vulnerability detection by leveraging LLMs' adaptability and fine-grained explanations.

Method: Design targeted prompts for LLMs, apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5, and introduce an Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts architecture with dynamic feature weighting.

Result: SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: SAEL effectively integrates LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features, demonstrating superior performance in smart contract vulnerability detection.

Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract
vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability
detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle
with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models
perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.
In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they
often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on
specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by
general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,
contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for
smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to
guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which
serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to
process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To
combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive
Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a
Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and
Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective
integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through
gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent
feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that
SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

*Ahmed Sabbah,Radi Jarrar,Samer Zein,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study examines how deprecated and restricted Android permissions affect ML models for malware detection, finding minimal impact on performance and improved concept drift detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research on permission-based malware detection ignored factors like deprecated/restricted permissions and OS updates, which may cause concept drift.

Method: Used a dataset of 166 permissions from 70K+ apps, applied ML/DL classifiers, and tested concept drift strategies.

Result: Deprecated/restricted permissions had marginal impact; CNN accuracy improved. Dataset balancing enhanced performance and drift detection.

Conclusion: Excluding deprecated/restricted permissions improves drift detection and model performance, with dataset balancing further enhancing results.

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It
involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access
sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years,
various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware
detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques,
often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked
important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction
of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute
to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted
permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset
containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and
benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were
employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection
strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective
features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted
permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases,
such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced
the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset
balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances,
and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the misuse of text-to-image diffusion models to create hateful optical illusions, evaluates current content moderation models' vulnerabilities, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging risk of adversaries using AI-generated optical illusions to embed hate messages and bypass content moderation.

Method: Generated 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, evaluated six moderation classifiers and nine VLMs, and explored mitigation measures.

Result: Existing moderation models showed low detection accuracy (below 0.245 for classifiers and 0.102 for VLMs), highlighting vulnerabilities in vision encoders.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved moderation tools to detect hidden hate messages and suggests effective mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation
of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create
different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such
techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages
into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,
we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful
illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation
models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable
Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are
hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or
subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models
(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal
significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection
accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.
We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which
mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary
layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore
preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from
the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DeCoda is a hybrid framework combining LLM-based deobfuscation and code graph learning to detect malicious JavaScript, achieving high F1-scores and improved TPR in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious JavaScript poses threats to privacy and security, but detection is hard due to obfuscation and language complexities like nested closures.

Method: DeCoda uses a prompt-learning pipeline for LLM-based deobfuscation and a Cluster-wise Graph to learn hierarchical code representations from ASTs.

Result: Achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71%, with 10.74% and 13.85% improvements over baselines, and better TPR in false-positive control.

Conclusion: LLM-based deobfuscation and cluster-level modeling are effective for detecting malicious JavaScript.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services,
malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user
privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats
remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and
JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure
structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid
defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation
with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated
prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM
progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs
and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)
In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while
deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise
and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn
hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that
synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and
node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level
semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%
and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of
10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control
evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers
4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing
baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation
and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in
detecting malicious code.

### [245] [Empirical Evaluation of Concept Drift in ML-Based Android Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22772)
*Ahmed Sabbah,Radi Jarrar,Samer Zein,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study explores concept drift's impact on Android malware detection, testing various algorithms and feature types. Results show widespread drift, with performance affected by feature types and data environments, not fully mitigated by balancing or LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how concept drift degrades Android malware detection models and evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms and feature types in addressing it.

Method: Evaluated two datasets, nine machine learning and deep learning algorithms, and LLMs, considering static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and image-based features.

Result: Concept drift is widespread, significantly impacting performance. Feature types, data environments, and detection methods influence drift. Balancing and LLMs help but don't fully resolve drift.

Conclusion: Concept drift remains a challenge in Android malware detection, requiring further research beyond current algorithmic and feature-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection
models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware
characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of
concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models
(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and
image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is
widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the
drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.
Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address
concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware
landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and
concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables
since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm
configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated
promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

### [246] [Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22207)
*Arabind Swain,Sean Alexander Ridout,Ilya Nemenman*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper explores detecting shared signals between high-dimensional variables using random matrix theory, comparing three covariance matrices and identifying phase transitions in detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how shared signals between high-dimensional variables can be detected and reconstructed despite sampling noise.

Method: Analyzes three covariance matrices (self, cross, and joint) using random matrix theory to observe detectability phase transitions.

Result: Joint and cross covariance matrices reconstruct shared signals earlier than self covariances; performance depends on dimensionality mismatch.

Conclusion: The findings guide method selection for detecting linear correlations and suggest implications for nonlinear dependencies.

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two
high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine
when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations,
despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider
three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional
variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the
self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the
self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous,
and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices,
and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the
shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross
approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the
variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right
method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may
generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

### [247] [Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787)
*F. Gallavotti,A. Zaccone*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: A vectorial extension of the Hopfield model replaces binary states with unit vectors, showing enhanced memory capacity and connections to amorphous solid physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge associative memory mechanisms with disordered material physics by generalizing the Hopfield model to continuous vector states.

Method: Uses a generalized Hebbian learning rule to create a block-structured weight matrix, analogous to amorphous solids' Hessian matrix.

Result: Demonstrates energy gaps (~7 units), anisotropy ratios (~10²), and higher memory capacity (γ_c ≈ 0.55) compared to binary networks (γ_c ≈ 0.138).

Conclusion: The model links associative memory to amorphous solid physics, revealing scaling laws similar to elastic networks.

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a
fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$)
and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

### [248] [A Segmentation Framework for Accurate Diagnosis of Amyloid Positivity without Structural Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22336)
*Penghan Zhu,Shurui Mei,Shushan Chen,Xiaobo Chu,Shanbo He,Ziyi Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for brain region segmentation and amyloid positivity classification using PET images alone, achieving high accuracy and reducing reliance on structural MRI or CT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated, scalable, and reliable analysis of PET images without requiring structural MRI or CT, addressing limitations in settings where such imaging is unavailable.

Method: A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers was trained on 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans (130/20/50 split). Performance was evaluated using Dice scores and normalized root mean square error.

Result: High segmentation accuracy (Dice scores 0.45-0.88), low error (0.0011), and 0.98 classification accuracy for amyloid positivity (AUC 0.99).

Conclusion: The model shows promise for PET-only diagnostic pipelines, reducing manual work and enabling broader clinical and research applications. Future work includes validation and extension to other PET tracers.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated
segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using
positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for
structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was
trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans,
with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with
scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy,
particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake
within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus,
and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square
error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a
classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake
quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results
highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic
pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available.
This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation,
enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research
applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to
diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model, improves fMRI decoding by leveraging spatial-temporal attention and self-supervised learning on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding mental states from fMRI data is challenging due to high dimensionality, noise, and limited data. The goal is to improve decoding performance using transfer learning.

Method: Proposes STDA-SwiFT, a transformer model with spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning, pretrained on 995 HCP subjects.

Result: Substantially improves task-evoked activity decoding across sensory and cognitive domains, even with minimal preprocessing.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with large-scale datasets effectively addresses fMRI decoding challenges.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain
activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial
precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --
remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,
and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer
vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns
transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via
spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.
Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human
Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves
downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory
and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate
performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient
attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in
pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer
learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome
challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

### [250] [Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22481)
*Tianyi Liu,Kejun Wu,Chen Cai,Yi Wang,Kim-Hui Yap,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework is proposed, leveraging visual foundation models and a corruption-aware feature completion module to achieve high-quality recovery without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bitstream-corrupted video recovery are labor-intensive due to manual annotation requirements and struggle with misleading local residual information.

Method: The framework integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, using a Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model and a Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC) module for adaptive processing.

Result: The method achieves outstanding performance in recovery without needing manually labeled masks, suppressing artifacts and enhancing residuals.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves user experience and reliability in multimedia systems, offering wider application potential.

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

*Haoyu Wei,Xin Liu,Yuhui Liu,Qiang Fu,Wolfgang Heidrich,Edmund Y. Lam,Yifan Peng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an off-aperture DOE design to improve imaging fidelity in wide fields of view, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems by over 5 dB in PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing E2E imaging systems struggle with high computational complexity and off-axis aberrations, limiting image fidelity at wide fields of view.

Method: The study positions a DOE off-aperture for local wavefront control, using hybrid refractive-diffractive optics and differentiable ray/wave optics modeling.

Result: Off-aperture DOE improves imaging quality by over 5 dB PSNR at ~45° FoV and recovers color/depth at ~28° FoV.

Conclusion: The off-aperture DOE method is effective and versatile, validated by physical prototypes.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs
with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.
However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining
high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational
complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while
accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of
placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a
global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work
explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,
enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local
control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages
hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and
wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and
demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the
off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of
approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming
traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and
depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE
configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications
validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

*MohammadAmin Alamalhoda,Arsalan Firoozi,Alessandro Venturino,Sandra Siegert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: trAIce3D is a deep-learning architecture for precise 3D microglia segmentation, improving accuracy and scalability for complex cellular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with overlapping structures, noise, and require dataset-specific tuning, limiting clinical insights for microglia in neurodegenerative diseases.

Method: A two-stage approach: 3D U-Net with vision transformers for soma detection, enhanced with cross-attention for branch refinement, using self-supervised and prompt-based training.

Result: Significant improvement in segmentation accuracy and generalization on 41,230 microglial cells, scalable for complex morphologies.

Conclusion: trAIce3D's architecture is adaptable to other cell types, enhancing neurobiological research.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

*Yuxin Wei,Yue Zhang,Moxin Zhao,Chang Shi,Jason P. Y. Cheung,Teng Zhang,Nan Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using depth and surface information for spine morphology estimation in AIS, overcoming limitations of X-rays and RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of X-rays (radiation, accessibility) and RGB images (environmental sensitivity) in AIS assessment.

Method: Proposes GAMA-Net for depth estimation, integrating patch-level and global features with PBHA and AMFF modules, then combines depth and surface data for spine morphology.

Result: Depth estimation achieves 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5% accuracy; spine curve generation reaches 97% accuracy.

Conclusion: The integrated approach improves AIS assessment accuracy and generalizability, offering a viable alternative to X-rays.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and
appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common
form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant
limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and
remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB
images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible
to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model
stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel
pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,
compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine
morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the
subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an
adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale
Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both
patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based
Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)
module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our
depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different
evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,
respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we
integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.
This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,
achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

*Tobias Sesterhenn,Ian Berlot-Attwell,Janis Zenkner,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: TroVE's toolbox approach for LLMs on MATH shows marginal gains, likely due to higher compute, not tool reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reusing theorems and formulas is key in math problem-solving. TroVE claims LLMs can benefit similarly by reusing tools, but doubts exist about its actual gains.

Method: Re-evaluate TroVE on MATH, analyze its modes (direct generation, tool creation, reuse), and correct its selection mechanism.

Result: TroVE's performance improves by 3% after correction, but gains reduce to 1% when compute is matched, suggesting minimal benefit from tool reuse.

Conclusion: The toolbox approach in TroVE does not significantly outperform direct generation on MATH, with gains mainly from higher compute.

Abstract: Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem
solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex
challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language
Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and
reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an
ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and
reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only
performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,
2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often
trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from
self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on
MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does
not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget
spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small
correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,
boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for
compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%,
suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on
MATH.

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised federated learning framework for LEO satellite networks reduces processing time and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites are key for 6G networks, but FL in these resource-constrained, dynamic environments faces challenges like unreliable convergence and high energy use.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised FL framework with hierarchical clustering, sparsification, adaptive weight quantization, and two-stage aggregation (satellite and ground stations).

Result: Reduces processing time by up to 3x and energy consumption by up to 4x compared to other methods, while preserving model accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses FL challenges in LEO satellite networks, offering significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pupil-optimized holographic near-eye display (NED) that eliminates eyepieces and improves image quality by optimizing amplitude and phase distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current holographic NEDs face challenges like degraded image quality due to finite pupil apertures, limiting VR/AR display performance.

Method: The method uses a customized spherical phase modulation to generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, optimizing amplitude and phase distributions.

Result: The approach mitigates image degradation and resolves depth cue issues, advancing compact and lightweight holographic NEDs.

Conclusion: This method represents a significant step toward practical, high-quality holographic NEDs for future VR/AR technologies.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization
approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)
displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing
comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical
assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms
enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical
implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face
substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil
apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this
study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our
proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to
generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the
dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of
amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly
mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves
inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method
signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact,
lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent
requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

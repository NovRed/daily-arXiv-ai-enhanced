### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines perceived risk in automated vehicles using driving simulator with different driving styles and pedestrian interactions. Facial expression analysis proved unreliable for risk assessment, but neural network using motion and physiological data effectively predicted perceived risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors affecting public acceptance of automated vehicles, particularly how driving style and critical interactions influence perceived risk and safety.

Method: Driving simulator experiment with 32 participants, testing two automated driving styles (calm vs dynamic) with optional pedestrian crossing. Collected continuous subjective ratings, motion data, facial expressions, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking.

Result: Dynamic driving style caused stronger discomfort; pedestrian crossing doubled comfort decrement with dynamic style. Facial expressions unreliable for risk detection (only 9/24 showed reactions, mostly Happy not Fear). Neural network using motion and skin conductance effectively predicted perceived risk.

Conclusion: Facial expression recognition is unreliable for automated vehicle risk assessment, but neural networks combining vehicle motion and physiological data show promise for objective perceived risk evaluation, reducing subjective bias.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer is a universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances text-to-image models by generating more precise prompts through reinforcement learning, improving image-text alignment without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to faithfully render complex user prompts, leading to mismatches between user intent and generated output, particularly in attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.

Method: A Chain-of-Thought rewriter trained through reinforcement learning guided by an AlignEvaluator reward model, which provides explicit feedback based on 24 key points derived from common T2I failure modes.

Result: Extensive experiments on HunyuanImage 2.1 show significant improvements in image-text alignment across various semantic and compositional challenges.

Conclusion: PromptEnhancer effectively enhances any pretrained T2I model without weight modifications and introduces a new human preference benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext is a 2B-parameter DiT model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing through architectural modifications, large-scale pre-training, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy, outperforming larger models like BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many open-source multimodal models prioritize scaling parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting efficiency and performance. The authors aim to develop a more efficient model with better training strategies.

Method: Architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium, large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement (PDTR) strategy that strengthens text-to-image generation and editing capabilities in a staged manner without negative interference.

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger parameters. When extended to UniPic2-Metaquery (combined with Qwen2.5-VL-7B), it achieves top-tier performance across diverse multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm (Skywork UniPic 2.0) is effective and generalizable, enabling state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters through optimized training strategies rather than simply scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag is a real-time drag-based image editing framework that uses pixel-space bidirectional warping and inpainting instead of latent space manipulation, achieving 0.01s warping previews and 0.3s inpainting at 512x512 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on latent space manipulation, leading to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints that hinder user experience.

Method: Decomposes drag editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping (treating image regions as deformable materials) and image inpainting, serving as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without modification.

Result: Achieves real-time performance (0.01s warping preview, 0.3s inpainting), superior visual quality, precise control, and automatic inheritance of future inpainting improvements.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves interaction experience over existing methods, providing real-time feedback and universal compatibility while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH is a diffusion-based defense framework that uses generative models to neutralize adversarial patch attacks in object detection by regenerating and rectifying images, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring prior knowledge of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art object detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks that can conceal or create objects, posing serious security risks. Current defense methods lack effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness against diverse and unknown attack types.

Method: DISPATCH employs a 'regenerate and rectify' strategy using diffusion models. It first regenerates the entire image to align with benign data distribution, then identifies and replaces adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. The approach is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of patches.

Result: Extensive experiments show DISPATCH outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving 89.3% mAP.5 on hiding attacks and reducing attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. It maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks across multiple detectors.

Conclusion: DISPATCH provides a practical and reliable defense solution for object detection systems, demonstrating superior performance, generalizability, and robustness against diverse adversarial patch attacks without requiring attack-specific knowledge.

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH is a unified framework for global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos that addresses camera orientation and translation integration challenges through analytical heading angle decomposition and camera trajectory integration inspired by world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos faces challenges with depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and camera-human movement entanglement. Existing human-motion-centric approaches insufficiently exploit camera orientation information and ineffectively integrate camera translation cues.

Method: WATCH introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique for efficient camera orientation handling and a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models to effectively leverage camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches.

Result: WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction on in-the-wild benchmarks, demonstrating effective joint modeling of camera-human motion relationships.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction and provides new insights for this problem domain. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware framework that improves dense video captioning by converting timestamp annotations into frame importance weights and using semantic-based adaptive caption retrieval to handle scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end dense video captioning models have two limitations: they apply timestamp supervision only to text while treating all video frames equally, and they retrieve captions from fixed-size video chunks which overlook scene transitions.

Method: Proposes Saliency-aware Video Reweighting (converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights) and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval (segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions and improve caption retrieval).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning through a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV-based traffic surveillance system using multi-scale template matching and Kalman filtering for vehicle detection, tracking, and violation analysis with 91.8% precision and comprehensive urban mobility analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic monitoring systems have limited coverage, low adaptability, and poor scalability, creating challenges for urban mobility and road safety.

Method: Leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and homography-based calibration to process aerial video data from 200m altitudes. Uses geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis for violation detection.

Result: Achieved 91.8% detection precision, 90.5% F1-score, and tracking metrics of 92.1% MOTA/93.7% MOTP. Successfully classified 5 vehicle types and detected traffic violations like unsafe lane changes and illegal parking.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates scalability, accuracy, and practical relevance as an infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for smart cities, supporting comprehensive urban mobility analytics.

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba is a hybrid vision backbone that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with multi-directional Mamba SSMs for global context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between CNNs (good at local features but poor global reasoning) and modern architectures like ViTs and SSMs (good global context but poor local feature capture), creating a model that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Uses a convolutional stem and hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in early stages for local feature extraction, followed by multi-directional Mamba blocks in later stages for efficient long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity.

Result: VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters) and 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K (exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU with 62% fewer parameters).

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture successfully combines the strengths of both approaches, delivering superior performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating convolutional inductive biases with state space models for vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

### [10] [Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687)
*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework using vision-language models for semantic segmentation that follows complex textual guidelines without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world semantic segmentation requires strict adherence to complex, evolving textual labeling guidelines that traditional methods and recent open-vocabulary approaches fail to handle effectively.

Method: Training-free multi-agent framework with Worker-Supervisor iterative refinement: Worker performs segmentation, Supervisor critiques against guidelines, and reinforcement learning stop policy terminates the loop.

Result: Notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses guideline-consistent semantic segmentation without expensive retraining, balancing accuracy with resource efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques for adapting 3D object detection models across different LiDAR sensor configurations: Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning, showing improved cross-configuration generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation when 3D object detection models trained on one LiDAR sensor configuration are applied to different configurations due to point cloud distribution shifts, which remains an unexplored domain gap.

Method: Two techniques: 1) Downstream Fine-tuning - dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training, and 2) Partial Layer Fine-tuning - updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization. Uses paired datasets from same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations.

Result: Joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each sensor configuration.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

### [12] [CD-Mamba: Cloud detection with long-range spatial dependency modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04729)
*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CD-Mamba is a hybrid cloud detection model that combines convolutional neural networks for local spatial features with Mamba's state-space modeling for long-range dependencies, achieving superior performance in remote sensing image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing images are often obscured by cloud cover, which compromises data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches.

Method: Propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution (for capturing local spatial dependencies) and Mamba's state-space modeling (for modeling long-range dependencies) into a unified cloud detection network. The model captures both pixel-wise textural details and long-term patch-wise dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods in cloud detection across diverse spatial scales.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining CNN and Mamba effectively manages both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy for cloud cover in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCT framework addresses class imbalance in medical image segmentation using partially labeled datasets through task consistency training without extra models, with filtering and uncertainty-weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VMIS approaches suffer from class imbalance due to unequal category distribution in partially labeled datasets, and existing pseudo-label methods require additional models and suffer from label noise degradation.

Method: Task Consistency Training (TCT) with main segmentation head and multiple auxiliary task heads, consistency constraints between heads, filtering strategy for low-consistency data, and unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: TCT framework successfully addresses class imbalance in versatile medical image segmentation without requiring additional models, effectively utilizing unlabeled anatomical structures while mitigating noise and quality decline issues.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like SAM/SAM2 struggle with adverse weather conditions due to lack of uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces uncertainty-aware methods to improve segmentation robustness for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM and SAM2 models perform poorly in adverse weather conditions with high visual ambiguity because they lack uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 incorporating uncertainty metrics into loss function, 2) Adapting Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT) from medical imaging to driving contexts.

Result: UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling is valuable for enhancing segmentation reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving applications, particularly in challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

TL;DR: MCANet is a multi-label classification framework for hurricane damage assessment that uses multi-scale feature learning and class-specific attention to outperform existing CNN methods on UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods struggle with multi-scale spatial features and distinguishing visually similar damage types in post-hurricane damage assessment.

Method: MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone for multi-scale context and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module with different spatial granularities to balance local detail with global context.

Result: Achieves 91.75% mAP on RescueNet dataset (4,494 UAV images), outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With 8 attention heads, performance improves to 92.35% with over 6% boost for challenging classes like Road Blocked.

Conclusion: MCANet effectively localizes damage-relevant regions and supports interpretability. Future work could integrate knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs for better adaptability to unseen disasters and enhanced semantic understanding.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

*Kaname Yokoyama,Chihiro Nakatani,Norimichi Ukita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic human group detection in videos using Vision-Language Model features and global optimization across frames to handle changing groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume static groups in videos, but real-world groups change dynamically. Both local appearance features and global context are needed for complex group detection.

Method: Uses VLM augmented for group detection to extract local and global features. Performs global optimization using graph with all frames' groupness probabilities from groupness-augmented CLIP features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully detects dynamically changing human groups in videos by combining VLM features with temporal consistency through global optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloodVision is a zero-shot framework that combines GPT-4o's vision-language capabilities with a domain knowledge graph to accurately estimate floodwater depth from RGB images without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for flood detection suffer from accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training, making them unsuitable for diverse flood scenarios.

Method: Combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a structured knowledge graph containing canonical dimensions of urban objects. Dynamically identifies reference objects, retrieves verified heights, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 8.17 cm on 110 crowdsourced images, reducing GPT-4o baseline error by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. Generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time.

Conclusion: FloodVision provides accurate, generalizable flood depth estimation suitable for integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PIG, a hybrid framework for text-to-video retrieval that combines advantages of both Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency through pseudo-query generation and fine-grained interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based approaches for text-to-video retrieval face trade-offs: Two-Tower framework has low effectiveness while Single-Tower framework has low efficiency. There's a need for a solution that achieves both high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously.

Method: Proposes PIG (Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation) with a pseudo-query generator that creates pseudo-queries for each video, enabling fine-grained interaction between video features and textual features before receiving actual queries.

Result: Achieves 1.6%-3.9% improvement in R@1 on five text-video retrieval benchmarks. Matches Two-Tower model efficiency while achieving near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Hybrid-Tower framework successfully combines the advantages of both Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, demonstrating that high effectiveness and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously in text-to-video retrieval without additional computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration tasks like surface mapping and resource localization, but aligning data from diverse lunar sensors (optical, hyperspectral, radar) is challenging due to resolution, illumination, and sensor distortion differences.

Method: Evaluated five feature matching algorithms (SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, SuperGlue) using cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions with a preprocessing pipeline including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, PCA, and shadow correction.

Result: SuperGlue consistently yielded the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods like SIFT and AKAZE performed well near equator but degraded under polar lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions, with SuperGlue demonstrating superior performance over traditional feature matching methods.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.

TL;DR: Transformer-based models outperform CNNs for mobile-acquired skin disease classification, achieving superior performance on a large dataset of 50+ disease categories with enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skin disease diagnostics are costly and unavailable in low-resource settings, while existing deep learning studies are limited to dermoscopic datasets and narrow disease ranges.

Method: Curated large mobile-acquired dataset of 50+ skin disease categories, evaluated multiple CNN and Transformer architectures (particularly Swin Transformer), and incorporated Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: Transformer models, especially Swin Transformer, achieved superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features, with Grad-CAM providing clinically relevant region highlighting.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches show strong potential for accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments using mobile devices.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

*Svetlana Pavlitska,Beyza Keskin,Alwin Faßbender,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixture of Experts (MoE) provides well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates for semantic segmentation without architectural changes, outperforming ensemble methods in reliability under out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reliability of computer vision models in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception by improving uncertainty estimation accuracy and calibration.

Method: Investigates three uncertainty extraction methods (predictive entropy, mutual information, expert variance) from MoEs with gating networks, evaluated on A2D2 dataset with semantic split and Cityscapes dataset.

Result: MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in conditional correctness metrics under OOD data. Simple gating mechanisms provide better calibration than complex classwise gates. Increasing experts improves uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: MoEs offer efficient and well-calibrated uncertainty estimation for semantic segmentation, with potential for further improvement through increased expert count and simple gating mechanisms.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: MLP-SRGAN is a novel single-dimension super resolution GAN that combines MLP-Mixers with convolutional layers for slice-direction upsampling of MRI images, outperforming existing methods with sharper results, fewer parameters, and faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve super resolution of MRI images, particularly for images with low spatial resolution in the slice dimension, by developing a more efficient and effective architecture that preserves fine anatomical details.

Method: Uses Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) combined with convolutional layers for single-dimension upsampling. Trained on high-resolution FLAIR MRI from MSSEG2 dataset and validated on three multicentre datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA).

Result: Produces sharper edges, less blurring, better texture preservation, and more anatomical detail compared to state-of-the-art SR networks. Achieves this with fewer parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size.

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN demonstrates superior performance in MRI super resolution with improved efficiency, making it a promising approach for clinical applications where ground truth HR images may not be available.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,

TL;DR: Proposes LFMT, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework with Subspace Simple Scanning strategy and dual-stage modeling for efficient light field image super-resolution with improved performance and low complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods for light field super-resolution suffer from inefficient and redundant feature extraction due to multi-directional scanning strategies when applied to complex LF data, and state space limitations in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information.

Method: Introduces Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) for efficient feature extraction. Uses dual-stage modeling: Stage I with Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow features, Stage II with dual-branch parallel structure combining Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement.

Result: LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in light field super-resolution, achieving substantial performance improvements while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-world and synthetic LF datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework LFMT successfully integrates the strengths of both models for comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains, providing an effective solution for light field image super-resolution.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end visual grounding methods rely only on referred targets for supervision and lack multi-granularity discrimination, limiting their robustness in complex scenarios where prominent prospective targets could provide additional benefits.

Method: Proposes PropVG framework with two key modules: Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) using sentence and word-level contrastive learning, and Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) that fuses object- and semantic-level information for better absent target recognition.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: PropVG successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating proposal generation with referential comprehension and incorporating multi-granularity discrimination, showing improved performance across various visual grounding benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

Motivation: Manual mitosis counting is time-consuming and suffers from inter-observer variability. AI solutions face challenges with domain shift (organ/species/staining variations) and severe class imbalance between mitotic figures and normal nuclei.

Method: Pixel-level segmentation approach with teacher-student UNet model integrating contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training. Uses pseudo-masks for mitoses, hard negatives, and normal nuclei. Multi-scale CNN classifier leverages segmentation features in multi-task learning.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection (Track 1) and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification (Track 2) on preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The unified framework combining segmentation-based detection and classification effectively addresses domain shift and class imbalance, demonstrating robust performance for automated mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

*Yifei Jia,Shiyu Cheng,Yu Dong,Guan Li,Dong Tian,Ruixiao Peng,Xuyi Lu,Yu Wang,Wei Yao,Guihua Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz is a visual analytics system that uses Vision Transformers and clustering to analyze temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations, enabling expert-driven pattern discovery and interpretation through automated labeling and multi-view exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding scramjet combustion dynamics is crucial for high-speed propulsion, but large-scale temporal flow field data presents challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison.

Method: Uses pretrained Vision Transformers to extract embeddings from flow field images, applies dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to identify combustion modes, constructs temporal trajectories, and employs vision-language models for automated natural-language summaries with expert annotations.

Result: The system effectively enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and improves knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis, as demonstrated through expert-informed case studies and feedback.

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz provides a comprehensive workflow that bridges latent representations with expert reasoning, facilitating in-depth analysis of complex combustion dynamics through parameter-aware visualization and automated interpretation tools.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

*Enze Ye,Wei Lin,Shaochi Ren,Yakun Liu,Xiaoping Li,Hao Wang,He Sun,Feng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFHT is a pose-free 3D refractive index reconstruction framework that enables high-throughput tomographic imaging of flowing cells with arbitrary geometries and complex rotations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that require known poses and uniform rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D quantitative phase imaging methods assume uniform single-axis rotation and require known cell poses, which restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, limiting statistical analysis capabilities.

Method: Leverages Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) to jointly optimize each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, supporting arbitrary geometries and multi-axis rotations.

Result: Enables accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections (as few as 10 views) and restricted angular coverage (only 120 degrees), producing high-fidelity 3D refractive index distributions for entire flowing cell populations.

Conclusion: OmniFHT provides the first scalable and unbiased solution for in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, enabling robust label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS accelerates 3D reconstruction by focusing on points of interest using semantic Gaussian Splatting with color-based filtering, reducing training time by 25% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotics applications like tele-guidance and disaster response require fast and accurate 3D reconstruction, particularly for specific objects rather than entire scenes.

Method: Uses semantic Gaussian Splatting to generate coarse segmentation-ready scenes, then applies novel color-based effective filtering to isolate and refine semantic objects before full training completion.

Result: Achieves 25% reduction in training time compared to full semantic GS training, with higher novel-view-synthesis quality on both real-world outdoor and synthetic indoor datasets.

Conclusion: CoRe-GS effectively balances reconstruction quality and training efficiency by focusing computational resources on semantically relevant areas, making it suitable for time-critical mobile robotics applications.

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

*Trixia Simangan,Ahmed Nadeem Abbasi,Yipeng Hu,Shaheer U. Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cryo-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that automates cryoablation planning for prostate cancer, achieving performance comparable to human experts while significantly reducing planning time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cryoablation planning is manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability.

Method: Models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process where an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters in a simulated environment with clinical constraints.

Result: Achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared to best automated baselines and matched human expert performance with substantially less planning time on 583 retrospective cases.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows potential to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans for prostate cancer treatment.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained computer vision models can predict fear levels from spider images with good accuracy (MAE 10.1-11.0), with performance dependent on dataset size and explainable through spider-related features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable adaptive computerized exposure therapy by developing systems that can dynamically adjust visual stimuli based on patient fear responses, requiring accurate fear prediction from images.

Method: Adapted three diverse pretrained computer vision models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (0-100 scale) from 313 spider images, evaluated with cross-validation and explainability assessments.

Result: Models achieved average MAE between 10.1-11.0, with performance significantly harmed by reduced dataset size but plateauing with larger datasets. Models focused on spider-related features, with higher errors for distant views and artificial spiders.

Conclusion: Computer vision models show promise for predicting fear ratings in therapeutic applications, emphasizing the importance of explainability and sufficient dataset size for developing effective emotion-aware technologies.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data curation for training computer vision models for industrial wear and tear detection is expensive and time-consuming due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear scenarios.

Result: The model trained with synthetic data outperforms other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87 when tested on real images of rusted industrial objects.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for industrial wear detection and is customizable and easily extendable to other industrial wear and tear detection scenarios.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision

an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and

approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple attention-based MIL framework for automated sebocyte lipid droplet counting, showing baseline MLP outperforms attention-MIL in stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual counting of sebocyte lipid droplets is labor-intensive and subjective, requiring automated solutions for accurate quantification.

Method: Used Nile Red-stained sebocyte images annotated into 14 classes (~50k cells after augmentation). Benchmarked baseline MLP vs attention-based MIL with ResNet-50 features and instance weighting using 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared to attention-based MIL (mean MAE = 10.7), though MIL occasionally performed better in specific folds.

Conclusion: Simple bag-level aggregation provides robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to reach full potential.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniView improves novel view synthesis from single images by leveraging reference images from similar objects through a retrieval system and MLLM-assisted selection, with multi-level isolation layers and triple attention mechanism to prevent distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for novel view synthesis from single images suffer from severe distortions due to ambiguity in unobserved regions and interpolation near input views.

Method: Proposes UniView with retrieval/augmentation system using MLLM for reference image selection, plug-and-play adapter with multi-level isolation layers, and decoupled triple attention mechanism for feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging reference images from similar objects provides strong prior information that effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of single-image view synthesis, reducing distortions.

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper improves video-to-audio generation by fusing features from dual visual encoders and using GPT-2 for better cross-modal alignment, achieving competitive performance with only 16% of previous training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video-to-audio generation models from scratch is resource-intensive, and existing approaches using foundation models show promise but can be improved with richer semantic/temporal information and better feature alignment.

Method: Proposes MFM-Mapper that fuses features from dual visual encoders and replaces linear mapper with GPT-2 to improve cross-modal feature alignment, treating it as an autoregressive translation task.

Result: Achieves better semantic and temporal consistency with significantly reduced training requirements (only 16% of previous scale) while maintaining competitive performance with larger models.

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper demonstrates remarkable training efficiency and improved performance through dual visual encoder fusion and GPT-2-based mapping, making video-to-audio generation more accessible and effective.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion is a novel infrared-visible image fusion framework that handles dual-source degraded scenarios by integrating vision-language models for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization, eliminating the need for separate pre-enhancement steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared-visible image fusion methods assume high-quality inputs and struggle with degraded scenarios, requiring manual pre-enhancement steps that lead to error accumulation and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion) with two modules: Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) for frequency-domain degradation perception/suppression, and Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) for cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive feature aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments show GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared to existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates VLMs with dual-domain optimization to handle degraded fusion scenarios without separate pre-processing, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Result: ResNet-18 achieved the highest accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML models performed competitively when enhanced with deep features. Grad-CAM successfully highlighted diagnostically relevant regions.

Conclusion: AI-based diagnostic tools, particularly deep learning models with interpretability features, show strong potential for integration into clinical workflows for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection, offering high performance and transparency.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset Dark-traffic and SLVM model for low-light traffic scene perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception models struggle in low-light traffic scenes due to severe illumination degradation and lack of reliable visual cues, with no large-scale benchmark available for this specific scenario.

Method: Proposed Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM) with four key components: light-adaptive pupillary mechanism, feature-level separable learning strategy, task-specific decoupled branches, and spatial misalignment-aware fusion module. Also created Dark-traffic dataset using physically grounded illumination degradation.

Result: SLVM outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2% in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1% in instance segmentation, reduces EPE by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On LIS benchmark, surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by average 11 percentage points, exceeds Mask RCNN by 3.1 percentage points.

Conclusion: SLVM framework effectively addresses low-light traffic perception challenges, achieving superior performance with reduced computation. The Dark-traffic dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

*Cong Cao,Xianhang Cheng,Jingyuan Liu,Yujian Zheng,Zhenhui Lin,Meriem Chkir,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUIVITON is an automated virtual try-on system that drapes multi-layer clothing onto diverse humanoid characters using SMPL as proxy representation and combines geometric learning with diffusion models for correspondence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary body shapes and diverse humanoid characters for fully automated virtual try-on without manual intervention.

Method: Uses SMPL as proxy representation, separates into clothing-to-SMPL (geometric learning approach) and body-to-SMPL (diffusion model with multi-view consistent appearance features) correspondence tasks.

Result: Handles complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, generalizes to various humanoid characters (humans, robots, cartoons, creatures), maintains computational efficiency, and supports clothing size/material customization.

Conclusion: Produces high-quality 3D clothing fittings automatically without human labor, even without 2D sewing patterns, enabling practical adoption for diverse virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

*Jingqi Wu,Hanxi Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Hao Chen,Deyin Liu,Peng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADClick is an interactive image segmentation tool that generates pixel-level anomaly annotations from minimal user clicks and text descriptions, significantly improving anomaly detection performance in industrial inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection typically requires pixel-level annotations for defective samples, which limits scalability. The paper aims to enable precise labeling with minimal human input to improve AD model performance.

Method: Proposes ADClick (Interactive Image Segmentation algorithm) that uses few user clicks and brief text descriptions to generate pixel-wise annotations. Also introduces ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization.

Result: Achieves AP = 96.1% on MVTec AD with ADClick, and state-of-the-art results with ADClick-Seg: AP = 80.0%, PRO = 97.5%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1% on MVTec AD for multi-class anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed interactive segmentation approach enables efficient and precise anomaly annotation with minimal human input, significantly boosting industrial anomaly detection performance and achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and analyze AI methods for addressing MRI motion artifacts, which degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy, to assess current developments and identify future research directions.

Method: Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on deep learning approaches, especially generative models, with quantitative data extraction on datasets, architectures, and performance metrics.

Result: Deep learning generative models demonstrate effectiveness in reducing motion artifacts and improving MRI image quality, but face limitations in generalizability, require paired training data, and risk introducing visual distortions.

Conclusion: AI-driven DL generative models have significant potential for MRI quality improvement but need standardized datasets, reporting protocols, and more advanced techniques to reduce paired data dependency and enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

*Yangming Li,Chaoyu Liu,Lihao Liu,Simon Masnou,Carola-Bibian Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat is a geometry-constrained optimization framework that uses first-order and second-order geometric priors to improve Gaussian splatting training, including better initialization, gradient updates, and densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works used low-order geometric priors (like normal vectors) that were unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, limiting their effectiveness in regularizing Gaussian splatting optimization.

Method: The framework exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities, initializes Gaussian scales using principal curvatures for better surface coverage, and introduces efficient noise-robust estimation methods based on geometric structures like local manifolds.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis show that GeoSplat significantly improves Gaussian splatting performance and outperforms previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-constrained optimization framework with robust geometric priors effectively enhances the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, leading to superior performance in novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

### [44] [Scale-interaction transformer: a hybrid cnn-transformer model for facial beauty prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05078)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Transformer model called Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT) achieves state-of-the-art results in facial beauty prediction by explicitly modeling multi-scale feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional Neural Networks often process information at fixed scales and may overlook critical inter-dependencies between features at different granularity levels, which is crucial for accurate facial beauty prediction.

Method: The SIT architecture combines CNN's feature extraction power with Transformer's relational modeling. It uses parallel convolutions for multi-scale feature capture, then processes these as sequences through a Transformer encoder with self-attention to model interactions.

Result: Achieves Pearson Correlation of 0.9187 on SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling multi-scale visual cue interactions is crucial for high-performance facial beauty prediction, and hybrid CNN-Transformer models show great potential for complex image regression tasks requiring holistic understanding.

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using sparse mixture-of-experts layers in CNNs improves adversarial robustness without increasing inference cost, with some individual experts outperforming the full MoE model due to specialized robust subpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CNN robustness against adversarial attacks without resource-intensive countermeasures by leveraging sparse MoE layers to increase model capacity efficiently.

Method: Replace selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with sparse MoE layers in ResNet architectures on CIFAR-100, combined with adversarial training and switch loss for balancing.

Result: Single MoE layer insertion in deeper stages consistently improves robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks. Switch loss causes routing collapse onto few experts, concentrating adversarial training and making those paths more robust.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE layers effectively improve adversarial robustness, and robust subpaths emerge through specialization, with some individual experts outperforming the gated MoE model.

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

### [46] [Semi-supervised Deep Transfer for Regression without Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05092)
*Mainak Biswas,Ambedkar Dukkipati,Devarajan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation method for regression tasks that improves model performance when source data is unavailable and labeled target data is scarce, achieving up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like medicine face domain shift challenges where source models don't generalize well to target data. Source data is often unavailable due to privacy concerns or computational costs, and labeled target data is limited.

Method: CRAFT builds on Contradistinguisher framework but extends it for source-free semi-supervised transfer in regression tasks. It learns shared models without intermediate representation alignment and leverages unlabeled target data.

Result: CRAFT achieved up to 9% improvement in RMSE over fine-tuned models with scarce labeled examples, outperformed four state-of-the-art source-free DA models by more than 3%, and demonstrated efficacy on neuroscience EEG/MRI data and other real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT provides an efficient approach for source-free semi-supervised deep transfer for regression tasks, which is particularly valuable in biology and medicine where data privacy and scarcity are common challenges.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

TL;DR: Transformer-based framework for fast 3D texture generation from single image and mesh, eliminating UV mapping and differentiable rendering, achieving high-fidelity results in 0.2s per shape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for 3D textures are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to reference images, creating challenges for realistic 3D content creation.

Method: Transformer-based framework that predicts 3D texture field directly from single image and mesh, integrating triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses for efficient training and faster inference.

Result: Generates high-fidelity textures in single forward pass (0.2s per shape), outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-image texture reconstruction in fidelity to input image and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Practical solution for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation with faster texture generation and improved faithfulness to reference images.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGS-3D is a training-free refinement method that uses a "split-then-grow" framework to improve 3D instance segmentation by purifying ambiguous masks with geometric primitives and growing them into complete instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle with precise instance-level segmentation due to accumulated errors from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints.

Method: A "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, then grows them into complete instances by jointly fusing semantic and geometric information with mask filtering and spatial continuity exploitation.

Result: Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 show substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SGS-3D effectively produces high-fidelity 3D object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without requiring training.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised framework for sign language recognition using free-negative pairs and novel data augmentation to address contrastive learning limitations in handling video relevance and similar negative pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key issues in applying contrastive learning to sign language recognition: (1) treating all video parts equally without considering relevance, and (2) similar negative pairs due to shared movements between signs, which lead to non-discriminative features.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised learning framework with two components: a new self-supervised approach using free-negative pairs and a new data augmentation technique designed to work together for better sign representation learning.

Result: Shows considerable accuracy gains compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in SLR by focusing on relevant video parts and handling similar negative pairs, resulting in improved performance across multiple evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

*Yamei Chen,Haoquan Zhang,Yangyi Huang,Zeju Qiu,Kaipeng Zhang,Yandong Wen,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with symbolic graphics programming (SVG generation) but can be improved with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards, achieving performance comparable to frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to generate precise symbolic graphics programs (SGPs/SVGs) from natural language descriptions and understand how they comprehend the visual world through program synthesis.

Method: Introduces SGP-GenBench benchmark, then proposes reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards - format-validity gate for renderable SVG and cross-modal rewards using vision encoders (SigLIP for text-image, DINO for image-image alignment).

Result: Frontier proprietary models outperform open-source models on SGP-GenBench. RL method applied to Qwen-2.5-7B substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. RL induces finer object decomposition and contextual details.

Conclusion: Symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable framework for studying cross-modal grounding in LLMs, and RL with verifiable rewards effectively bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Motivation: To address the persistent limitation in machine learning models' ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings, which is key to human intelligence.

Method: A modular data generation framework that constructs rule-based tasks applying transformations to objects in grid environments, supporting composition over 28 interoperable transformations with adjustable depth and extensive control over grid parameters.

Result: Created millions of unique task rules across difficulty levels, with baseline experiments showing state-of-the-art vision models consistently fail to generalize to novel combinations despite strong in-domain performance.

Conclusion: COGITAO provides an open-source benchmark to support continued research in compositionality and generalization, highlighting the need for improved models that can better handle novel concept combinations.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments

TL;DR: WinT3R is a feed-forward reconstruction model that achieves real-time high-quality 3D reconstruction and camera pose estimation through a sliding window mechanism and global camera token pool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods face a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance, limiting practical applications that require both high-quality results and online processing capabilities.

Method: Uses a sliding window mechanism for efficient information exchange between frames and maintains a global camera token pool with compact camera representations to enhance pose estimation reliability while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation accuracy, and reconstruction speed across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: WinT3R successfully addresses the quality-speed trade-off in real-time 3D reconstruction, providing both high-quality results and real-time performance through innovative architectural designs.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

### [55] [The Ethical Compass of the Machine: Evaluating Large Language Models for Decision Support in Construction Project Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04505)
*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study evaluates ethical viability of LLMs in construction project management, finding they perform well on legal compliance but struggle with contextual nuance, accountability, and transparency. Experts recommend human oversight rather than autonomous AI for ethical decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the ethical viability and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in ethically sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts within construction project management.

Method: Mixed-methods research design: quantitative performance testing of two leading LLMs against 12 real-world ethical scenarios using Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), plus qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts.

Result: LLMs demonstrate adequate performance in structured domains like legal compliance but show significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed reservations about autonomous AI for ethical judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids rather than autonomous ethical agents, requiring robust human-in-the-loop oversight. The study introduces EDSAC as a replicable methodology for ethical AI evaluation.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

### [56] [Maestro: Joint Graph & Config Optimization for Reliable AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04642)
*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a holistic optimizer for LLM agents that jointly searches over both graph structures and node configurations, outperforming existing prompt optimizers by addressing structural failure modes that configuration-only tuning cannot fix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent optimizers only tune configurations while keeping the graph structure fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. There's a need for a holistic approach that optimizes both graph structure and node configurations simultaneously.

Method: Maestro performs joint search over agent graphs (module connections and information flow) and node configurations (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). It uses reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure modes while respecting rollout/token budgets.

Result: Maestro outperforms leading prompt optimizers (MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge) by average margins of 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86% respectively on IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks. Even in prompt-only optimization, it leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. It achieves these results with fewer rollouts than GEPA and shows large gains on interviewer and RAG applications.

Conclusion: Joint graph and configuration search is essential for building reliable LLM agents, as it addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix. Maestro demonstrates that holistic optimization significantly improves agent quality while being more sample-efficient than existing approaches.

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

### [57] [Towards Personalized Explanations for Health Simulations: A Mixed-Methods Framework for Stakeholder-Centric Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04646)
*Philippe J. Giabbanelli,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to generate tailored explanations of health simulations using LLMs by identifying stakeholder needs and optimizing outputs for different health professionals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches provide generic summaries of health simulations that don't meet the varied needs of different stakeholders like clinicians, policymakers, and patients.

Method: Mixed-methods design: first eliciting explanation needs from diverse health stakeholders, then optimizing LLMs via controllable attribute tuning, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Result: A step-by-step framework that enables LLMs to generate customized explanations of health simulations tailored to specific stakeholder requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the gap in stakeholder-specific explanations for health simulations, making complex models more accessible to those who need them most.

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

TL;DR: Proposes human-derived evaluation criteria to enhance AI benchmarks for physical world modeling, identifying key cognitive skills through interviews and surveys to create more human-aligned AI evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI benchmarks fail to capture nuanced capabilities needed for physical world modeling, particularly lacking in interpretability and human-aligned evaluation criteria.

Method: Conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys grounded in Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks to identify critical cognitive skills (Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, Contextualizing) for AI and human reasoning.

Result: Found that humans perceive AI as lacking interpretive and empathetic skills but hold high performance expectations. Developed a framework integrating human insights into benchmark design for more human-aligned evaluation.

Conclusion: User-centered evaluation is crucial for AI development. The proposed approach enhances current benchmarking practices and provides actionable guidelines for aligning AI capabilities with human cognitive processes.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

### [59] [Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for developing explicit hierarchical World Models using LLM-generated scaffolding to overcome exploration challenges in complex multi-agent tasks like robotic soccer, enabling more efficient strategic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning approaches in complex multi-agent domains like robotic soccer face intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. The development of sophisticated explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck for training capable agents.

Method: Proposes hierarchical scaffolding where complex goals are decomposed into structured subgoals, leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold and structure the World Model on the fly.

Result: Identifies a clear trend towards integrating symbolic/hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based on systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer.

Conclusion: Language-driven world models provide intrinsic curriculum, dense learning signals, and compositional learning framework, enabling agents to acquire sophisticated strategic behaviors with greater sample efficiency and bridging low-level reactive behaviors with high-level strategic team play.

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM is a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities through What-If Analysis and reinforcement learning, achieving 74.2% accuracy in forecasting game-state changes in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs currently lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures and forecast consequences before acting, which limits their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning and real-time decision making.

Method: Integrates What-If Analysis (WIA) with reinforcement learning to enable LLMs to dynamically simulate outcomes of potential actions. Validated in Honor of Kings game environment which requires precise multi-step consequence prediction.

Result: Achieves 74.2% accuracy in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines), with particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where accurate foresight is critical.

Conclusion: WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs, providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent is a multi-agent LLM framework that provides interactive natural language explanations for RL policies using five specialized agents to map user queries to XRL tools and generate various explanation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between complex RL policies and domain experts by improving comprehensibility of XRL results and providing integrated coverage of XRL approaches.

Method: Multi-agent LLM framework with five specialized agents (Coordinator, Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, Debugger) that automatically maps user queries to relevant XRL tools and generates explanations through key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual explanations.

Result: Successfully mapped user queries to XRL tasks with high accuracy, minimized counterfactual generation failures through coder-debugger interactions, and effectively interpreted agent's actions within the problem domain.

Conclusion: TalkToAgent provides an effective framework for interactive, natural language explanations of RL policies, bridging the gap between complex AI systems and human understanding through multi-agent LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

TL;DR: Language models demonstrate strong cooperative behavior in iterated prisoner's dilemma, matching or exceeding classical strategies with niceness, provocability, and rapid adaptability to opponent strategy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand language model cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party interactive settings, addressing gaps in prior work that neglected long-horizon interactions and human-model collaboration.

Method: Conducted Axelrod-style tournament pitting language model agents against 240 classical strategies in iterated prisoner's dilemma, with controlled strategy switch experiments to test adaptability.

Result: Language models achieved performance on par with or exceeding best-known classical strategies, exhibiting key cooperative properties and rapid adaptability to opponent strategy changes within few rounds.

Conclusion: First systematic characterization of long-term cooperative behaviors in language models, providing foundation for research in complex human-AI social environments.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Methodology for cloning conversational voice AI agents from call recordings that approaches human performance in routine tasks but struggles with persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate repetitive customer service tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide 24/7 support using AI voice assistants trained on human call data.

Method: Integrates automatic speech recognition, large language model dialogue management, and text-to-speech synthesis into streaming pipeline. Uses domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering from top human agent call transcripts.

Result: AI agent approaches human performance in routine call aspects (introduction, product communication) but underperforms in persuasion and objection handling compared to human agents.

Conclusion: Identifies limitations in persuasion capabilities, provides refined prompts, and suggests future research directions including large-scale simulation and automated evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work has advanced agent selection and result aggregation, but efficient linguistic interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical bottleneck that needs to be addressed.

Method: OSC introduces Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive collaborators' cognitive states, performs real-time cognitive gap analysis, and allows agents to adaptively adjust communication behaviors (content focus, detail level, expression style) using learned strategies.

Result: Experiments on complex reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task performance and communication efficiency, transforming parallel-working individuals into a deeply collaborative cognitive team.

Conclusion: The framework not only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM agent interaction behaviors, serving as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation processes.

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser is a novel end-to-end framework that improves GUI perception by using continuous coordinate modeling instead of discrete text-based methods, achieving higher accuracy and faster inference speed for complete interface parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for GUI perception have limitations including lower grounding accuracy, slower inference due to discrete coordinate modeling, and inability to parse entire interfaces - only predefined element sets.

Method: Uses continuous coordinate modeling with pre-trained MLLM, token router, and coordinate decoder. Introduces rejection mechanism based on modified Hungarian matching to reduce false positives by identifying non-existent elements.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. Achieves higher localization precision and faster inference speed.

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser successfully addresses limitations of prior methods by enabling fine-grained parsing of entire interfaces with improved accuracy and efficiency, supported by a new benchmark ScreenParse for systematic evaluation.

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

TL;DR: Ontology-based approach for controlling LLM conversational proficiency levels using formal linguistic definitions and description logic


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure predictable and user-personalized responses from LLMs by addressing the challenge of controllability in conversational agents

Method: Develop quantitative definitions for qualitative conversational features using linguistic descriptors, formalize in description logic, create ontology for reasoning, and fine-tune LLM for controlled text generation

Result: Consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions that improve transparency in conversational AI

Conclusion: Ontology-based formalization enables effective control of LLM conversational features and enhances transparency

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level

*Rajesh Tembarai Krishnamachari,Srividya Rajesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOVIS protocol enables privacy-preserving agent ranking for Web of Agents ecosystem using usage and competence metrics with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need performance-based ranking but current systems lack transparent interaction networks and have fragmented private usage data.

Method: Five-layer DOVIS protocol (Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics) with AgentRank-UC algorithm combining usage frequency and competence metrics.

Result: Simulation shows convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance for scalable trustworthy agent ranking.

Conclusion: Coordinated protocols and performance-aware ranking enable viable Web of Agents ecosystem.

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

*Jie Chen,Jinhao Jiang,Yingqian Min,Zican Dong,Shijie Wang,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS is a test-time scaling framework that uses collaborative LRMs with sticker-guided historical experience utilization to improve computational efficiency in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods rely on redundant sampling and ignore historical experience utilization, limiting computational efficiency for large reasoning models.

Method: Proposes a framework with three collaborative LRMs that iteratively explore and refine solutions using distilled key conditions (stickers) to extract, refine, and reuse critical information across reasoning rounds. Includes two-stage optimization combining imitation learning with self-improvement.

Result: Extensive evaluations on AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH benchmarks show Sticker-TTS consistently outperforms self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches under comparable inference budgets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective sticker-guided historical experience utilization, achieving superior performance and computational efficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

*Matteo Bortoletto,Yichao Zhou,Lance Ying,Tianmin Shu,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM is an AI system that uses Theory of Mind to provide targeted feedback promoting prosocial behavior in multi-agent systems, outperforming LLM baselines in efficiency and human preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans struggle with knowing when and how to assist others when pursuing independent goals, which hinders cooperation. The paper aims to develop AI that promotes prosocial behavior - actions benefiting others even when not directly aligned with one's own goals.

Method: ProToM uses Bayesian inverse planning to infer agents' goals, then selects feedback by maximizing expected utility based on the inferred goal distribution. It provides context-sensitive, targeted feedback to individual agents.

Result: ProToM achieved higher success rates, shorter task completion times, and was consistently preferred by human users compared to state-of-the-art LLMs. LLMs produced feedback that was poorly timed and contextually ungrounded, leading to higher communication overhead.

Conclusion: Theory of Mind-informed approaches like ProToM are more effective than current LLMs at providing targeted, helpful feedback that promotes prosocial behavior in multi-agent systems, demonstrating superior performance in both efficiency and human preference.

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal semantics for ODRL based on query answering that enables policy evaluation and comparison for digital rights management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL has become the de facto standard for governing digital resource access, but lacks a comprehensive formal semantics needed for proper policy evaluation and comparison.

Method: Developed a simple and intuitive formal semantics based on query answering that refines previous formalizations and aligns with ODRL 2.2 specification.

Result: Created a formal evaluation semantics that enables detection of equivalent, more restrictive, or more permissive policies in data sharing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed formal semantics provides a foundation for reliable policy evaluation and comparison in ODRL, addressing a critical gap in digital rights management.

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

TL;DR: LatticeWorld is a 3D world generation framework that uses lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) with Unreal Engine 5 to create dynamic, interactive 3D environments from multimodal inputs, achieving 90x efficiency gains over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the sim-to-real gap and enable convenient creation of realistic 3D simulations for applications in embodied AI, autonomous driving, and entertainment by automating the traditionally manual 3D world production process.

Method: Proposes LatticeWorld framework that combines lightweight language models (LLaMA-2-7B) with industry-grade rendering engines (Unreal Engine 5) to generate dynamic 3D environments from textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity, with over 90x increase in industrial production efficiency compared to traditional manual methods while maintaining high creative quality.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld demonstrates an effective approach to automated 3D world generation that significantly streamlines industrial production pipelines while delivering high-quality, interactive environments with realistic physics and multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

### [75] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with non-annotated charts due to reliance on recognition rather than reasoning. ChartReasoner framework mimics human visual reasoning to significantly improve chart understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive chart understanding but exhibit hallucinations and performance degradation with non-annotated charts, raising questions about whether they truly understand charts or just recognize patterns.

Method: Proposed ChartReasoner framework that mimics human behavior by grounding value estimation in chart understanding, establishing a comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark (CRBench) to evaluate visual reasoning abilities on non-annotated charts.

Result: ChartReasoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and demonstrates significant performance gains in general chart comprehension on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner enables MLLMs to rationally understand charts through visual reasoning rather than mere recognition, addressing the fundamental limitation of current MLLMs in chart comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with ontology term-to-identifier linking despite strong biomedical NLP performance. Analysis reveals identifier exposure is the strongest predictor of success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on biomedical tasks but fail to correctly link ontology terms to their identifiers, which is crucial for accurate biomedical information processing.

Method: Analyzed predictions across Human Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology using GPT-4o and LLaMa 3.1 405B models. Evaluated nine features including term familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure through univariate and multivariate analyses.

Result: Exposure to ontology identifiers emerged as the strongest predictor of successful term-to-identifier linking performance across both ontologies and models.

Conclusion: The key factor determining LLM success in ontology term linking is the model's exposure to ontology identifiers during training, rather than term familiarity or structural features.

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes U-ACS, an uncertainty-aware collaborative system that combines a powerful MLLM with a lightweight model for efficient multimodal sentiment analysis, using uncertainty to selectively escalate difficult samples to the MLLM while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance-efficiency trade-off in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which have high computational demands that limit real-world deployment, while smaller models are efficient but often sacrifice performance.

Method: Uses an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism where a lightweight model first processes all inputs, and only samples with high predictive uncertainty are escalated to the powerful MLLM. Includes strategies for handling ambiguous predictions through weighted averaging and prompt-based cross-verification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to using a standalone MLLM.

Conclusion: The proposed U-ACS system effectively reconciles the performance-efficiency trade-off by dynamically allocating computational resources based on sample difficulty, enabling practical deployment of multimodal sentiment analysis with high accuracy and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CoCoNUTS benchmark and CoCoDet detector for content-based AI review detection in peer review, addressing limitations of style-based detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in peer review pose fairness risks - existing detectors rely on stylistic cues and fail to distinguish between permissible language refinement and substantive AI-generated content.

Method: Developed CoCoNUTS benchmark with fine-grained dataset covering 6 human-AI collaboration modes, and CoCoDet detector using multi-task learning framework for content-based detection.

Result: Provides a practical foundation for evaluating LLM use in peer review and enables more accurate, robust detection of AI involvement in review content.

Conclusion: Content-based detection paradigm offers more precise, equitable and reliable methods for real-world scholarly applications compared to style-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

TL;DR: PtoP is a novel LLM framework that uses RAG with in-context learning and fine-tuning with synthetic oversampling to address hallucination and class imbalance in MBTI prediction from social media posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML/DL methods for MBTI prediction face challenges with LLM hallucination and imbalanced MBTI type distribution in the population.

Method: Leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation with in-context learning to reduce hallucination, and fine-tunes pretrained LLM with synthetic minority oversampling to handle class imbalance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 10 ML and DL baselines on real-world social media dataset.

Conclusion: PtoP effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based MBTI prediction and demonstrates superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance in biomedical NLP, particularly excelling in question answering tasks with 94.1% accuracy on MedQA and matching supervised systems on PubMedQA, while extraction and summarization tasks still benefit from domain-specific approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of biomedical literature requires scalable NLP solutions, and while GPT-4 narrowed the performance gap with task-specific systems, its performance across different biomedical domains remained inconsistent.

Method: Updated a standardized BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o using zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families (NER, relation extraction, classification, QA, summarization, simplification) with fixed prompt templates and identical decoding parameters.

Result: GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall performance with macro-average scores of 0.557 under five-shot prompting vs 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. It reached 94.1% accuracy on MedQA (exceeding previous SOTA by 50+ points) and parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA. Major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), though summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.

Conclusion: GPT-5 establishes itself as a general-purpose model with deployment-ready performance for biomedical QA, while precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark provides guidance for BioNLP system design as frontier models advance.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

Motivation: Large language models often produce unreliable outputs, but current research focuses more on quantifying uncertainty rather than diagnosing its underlying sources, which is crucial for improving LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Collect multiple responses from a target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze patterns of disagreement among these responses. The auxiliary model reasons about uncertainty sources (input ambiguity, knowledge gaps, or both) and identifies specific missing facts in knowledge gap cases.

Result: The framework was validated on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro datasets, demonstrating its generality in diagnosing distinct uncertainty sources across different domains and question types.

Conclusion: Diagnosing uncertainty sources through response disagreement patterns shows potential for manual interventions that can improve LLM performance and reliability, providing valuable insights beyond simple uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how emotional expressions influence dispute resolution outcomes using automatic text emotion recognition on buyer-seller dialogues, finding that large-language models outperform previous methods and provide insights for conflict management systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional expressions shape counterpart thoughts, feelings, and actions in conflict situations, particularly in dispute resolution where stronger emotions and different social processes emerge compared to negotiations.

Method: Used a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to investigate emotional expressions' impact on outcomes, comparing large-language models against previous emotion intensity annotation methods and human annotator decisions.

Result: Large-language models demonstrated considerably greater explanatory power than previous emotion annotation methods and better matched human annotator decisions. Findings supported existing theoretical models of how emotional expressions contribute to conflict escalation and resolution.

Conclusion: Agent-based systems could be useful in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional escalation, as automatic text emotion recognition provides valuable insights into emotional influence in conflict resolution.

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models form transferable task representations in non-monotonic, sporadic ways during in-context learning, with strong temporal and semantic locality that enables just-in-time adaptation to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how language models form representations for new tasks during in-context learning, particularly focusing on transferable representations that can restore task context without the full prompt.

Method: Investigated the evolution of transferable task representations in language models by analyzing how these representations change over the course of context, examining their formation patterns, locality, and relationship to task performance.

Result: Task representations evolve non-monotonically and sporadically, condensing multiple evidence into transferable representations that align with performance improvements. They exhibit strong temporal locality (forming only at certain tokens) and semantic locality (capturing minimal task scopes), while higher-level task categories remain persistently decodable.

Conclusion: Language models use a just-in-time computational process with two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) to adapt to new evidence and learn tasks on the fly, relying on both local transferable representations and distributed representations for composite tasks.

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel pruning method for LLMs that addresses prefill-decode disaggregation, enabling precise block pruning and token-aware KV cache optimization to reduce computational and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face high computational and memory costs in deployment. Existing pruning methods ignore the practical characteristics of prefill-decode disaggregation, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes iterative block removal for prefill and decode stages separately using pruning and distillation sets. Introduces token-aware cache pruning that retains all KV Cache in prefill but selectively reuses entries for first/last token sequences in decode layers.

Result: Achieves 20.56% inference speedup and 4.95x reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption. Consistently strong performance in both PD disaggregation and unified settings.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses PD disaggregation challenges, providing significant efficiency improvements for LLM deployment while maintaining performance across different inference settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a multilingual radiology report classification system using compact open-access language models that achieves expert-level performance with minimal computational resources and small annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for radiology report classification face limitations including linguistic variability challenges, need for large annotated datasets, dependency on closed-source/resource-intensive models, and restriction to English/single-modality datasets.

Method: Built on MedGemma-4B compact open-access language model, supports zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade GPUs (24GB memory). Evaluated across 7 datasets in 4 languages spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies.

Result: Achieves mean macro F1 score of 88% across 5 chest X-ray datasets (approaching/exceeding expert-level performance). With data augmentation, only 80 annotated samples needed for 82% weighted F1 score on Danish reports vs 86% with full 1600-sample training set.

Conclusion: MOSAIC offers practical alternative to large/proprietary LLMs in clinical settings, is open-source, and invites community evaluation/extension to new languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: RECAP benchmark evaluates intent rewriting for agent planning, addressing dialogue ambiguity through LLM-based rewriting that outperforms baselines and shows utility gains with fine-tuned DPO models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dialogues are often ambiguous and underspecified, making intent detection challenging for conversational assistants. Traditional classification approaches struggle in open-ended settings, leading to poor planning outcomes.

Method: Proposes RECAP benchmark for intent rewriting evaluation, develops prompt-based rewriting approach using LLMs, and fine-tunes two DPO-based rewriters to improve utility.

Result: LLM-based rewriting approach outperforms baselines, and fine-tuned DPO rewriters yield additional utility gains in planning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Intent rewriting is a critical and tractable component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems, with RECAP providing a valuable evaluation framework.

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Motivation: Address limitations in speech encoder and LLM integration due to insufficient data and resource requirements for various use cases.

Method: Propose parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings to LLM-compatible tokens, employ LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation, add classifier regularizer, and optimize LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: 26% relative WER improvement on LibriSpeech ASR, 6.3% relative F1 increase on NER, 32% relative F1 boost on sentiment analysis, and SLUE score improvements of 6.6% and 9.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed adapter provides efficient speech-LLM integration with substantial performance gains across multiple tasks while reducing parameter requirements and labeling costs.

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating speculative decoding methods to accelerate test-time scaling in LLMs, showing n-gram methods effectively capture repetitive patterns and should be combined with other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling enhances LLM reasoning but generates redundant computational overhead through repetitive reasoning traces. Speculative decoding could mitigate this inefficiency but hasn't been properly evaluated in this context.

Method: Created the first comprehensive benchmark with consistent protocols across test-time scaling paradigms (Best-of-N sampling, multi-round thinking) to evaluate three speculative decoding categories: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.

Result: N-gram-based methods effectively capture repetitive patterns and show unique potential for accelerating test-time scaling. Integration with model-based or training-based approaches balances acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables fair comparison and shows the value of combining n-gram methods with other approaches to make test-time scaling more efficient, spurring further research for faster LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParaThinker introduces parallel thought generation to overcome sequential scaling bottlenecks, enabling smaller LLMs to achieve superior reasoning with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling strategies hit diminishing returns due to "Tunnel Vision" - imperfect initial steps locking models into suboptimal reasoning paths, limiting performance gains from increased computation.

Method: ParaThinker is an end-to-end framework that trains LLMs to generate multiple diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer, implementing native thought parallelism.

Result: Achieves 12.3% accuracy improvement for 1.5B models and 7.5% for 7B models on reasoning benchmarks with 8 parallel paths, adding only 7.1% latency overhead.

Conclusion: Parallel compute scaling (width) is more effective than sequential scaling (depth), enabling smaller models to surpass larger counterparts and establishing parallel thinking as a critical dimension for future LLM scaling.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

TL;DR: CAMT5 introduces substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training to improve text-to-molecule generation, outperforming SOTA methods with only 2% of training tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-molecule models use atom-level tokenizations that focus on local connectivity but fail to capture global structural context like ring systems, limiting their ability to understand molecular semantics.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5) with substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures. Also introduces an ensemble strategy to aggregate outputs from multiple models.

Result: CAMT5 demonstrates superiority in various text-to-molecule generation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while using only 2% of training tokens. The ensemble strategy further boosts generation performance.

Conclusion: Substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training significantly improve text-to-molecule generation by better capturing global structural context and molecular semantics, enabling more efficient and effective models.

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource

ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent

demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rare token prediction in LLMs requires specialized plateau neurons beyond common token processing, forming dual computational regimes through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, and the mechanisms behind their specialization remain unclear despite prior identification of specialized plateau neurons.

Method: Neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models.

Result: (1) Rare tokens require additional plateau neurons beyond common token processing, forming dual regimes; (2) Plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather than clustered; (3) Attention shows no preferential routing to specialists.

Conclusion: Rare token specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity, preserving flexibility while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Personalized Visual Emotion Recognition using discrete prompt tuning to adapt MLLMs for individual-level emotion recognition, addressing the limitation of MLLMs favoring majority viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs perform well on general VER but favor majority opinions, limiting their effectiveness for personalized emotion recognition needed in real-world applications like opinion mining and advertisement design.

Method: Employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by human prompt engineering, selecting optimal natural language representations from generated prompts to update prompts for accurate personalized VER.

Result: The method enables adaptation of MLLMs to individual users, improving personalized emotion recognition performance beyond standard MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Discrete prompt tuning effectively addresses MLLMs' bias toward majority viewpoints, making personalized visual emotion recognition practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

### [97] [Energy Landscapes Enable Reliable Abstention in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04482)
*Ravi Shankar,Sheng Wong,Lin Li,Magdalena Bachmann,Alex Silverthorne,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Energy-based model outperforms softmax and kNN methods for reliable abstention in RAG systems, especially on hard semantic cases in safety-critical domains like women's health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation systems in safety-critical domains where incorrect answers can cause harm, particularly in women's health applications.

Method: Developed an energy-based model that learns a smooth energy landscape over 2.6M guideline-derived questions, benchmarked against calibrated softmax baseline and kNN density heuristic across easy and hard abstention splits.

Result: EBM achieved superior abstention performance on hard cases (AUROC 0.961 vs 0.950 for softmax) and reduced FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). Performance comparable on easy negatives but EBM excels in safety-critical hard distributions.

Conclusion: Energy-based abstention scoring provides more reliable confidence than probability-based softmax, offering scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems, with robustness primarily from energy scoring head.

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

### [98] [DecMetrics: Structured Claim Decomposition Scoring for Factually Consistent LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04483)
*Minghui Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DecMetrics introduces three new metrics (COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, SEMANTIC ENTROPY) to automatically evaluate claim decomposition quality, and uses them to optimize a lightweight decomposition model for fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on generative methods for claim decomposition but lacks proper evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of decomposed atomic claims, creating a gap in reliable fact-checking systems.

Method: Developed three automatic evaluation metrics (COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, SEMANTIC ENTROPY) and integrated them as a reward function to optimize a lightweight claim decomposition model.

Result: The approach provides automated quality assessment for claim decomposition and sets a benchmark for evaluating decomposition models in fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: DecMetrics bridges the evaluation gap in claim decomposition research and enhances the reliability and effectiveness of fact-checking systems through automated quality assessment metrics.

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

*Abdelrahman Sadallah,Tim Baumgärtner,Iryna Gurevych,Ted Briscoe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RevUtil dataset to evaluate review comment quality on four aspects (Actionability, Grounding & Specificity, Verifiability, Helpfulness) and shows fine-tuned models can match GPT-4o performance in assessing review utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With reviewers having less time, automated systems are needed to ensure high-quality peer review feedback that is useful for authors.

Method: Created RevUtil dataset with 1,430 human-labeled and 10k synthetically labeled review comments with rationales, then benchmarked fine-tuned models for assessing review aspects and generating explanations.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved human-level agreement comparable to or exceeding GPT-4o, but machine-generated reviews generally underperformed human reviews on the four utility aspects.

Conclusion: The RevUtil dataset enables development of models that can effectively assess review comment utility, helping maintain high-quality peer review despite time constraints.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

TL;DR: ASCENDgpt is a transformer model for cardiovascular risk prediction that uses phenotype-aware tokenization to reduce ICD codes by 77.9% while maintaining clinical meaning, achieving strong predictive performance across multiple cardiovascular outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cardiovascular risk prediction from EHR data by addressing the challenge of high-dimensional ICD codes through clinically meaningful tokenization while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency.

Method: Developed phenotype-aware tokenization mapping 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 phenotype tokens, pretrained using masked language modeling on 19,402 individuals, then fine-tuned for time-to-event prediction of five cardiovascular outcomes.

Result: Achieved excellent discrimination with average C-index of 0.816 across all outcomes: MI (0.792), stroke (0.824), MACE (0.800), cardiovascular death (0.842), and all-cause mortality (0.824).

Conclusion: Domain-specific tokenization and pretraining effectively enable clinically interpretable cardiovascular risk predictions while significantly reducing computational complexity in EHR-based models.

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes serialized output prompts (SOP) to enhance LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems, improving performance in complex scenarios like 3-speaker conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems either omit prompts or use simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring prompt design to enhance performance.

Method: Extracts serialized output prompts (SOP) using Separator and serialized CTC layers after speech encoder, then uses SOP as prompts for LLMs. Employs three-stage training: SOT fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation.

Result: Experimental results on LibriMix dataset show SOP approach significantly improves performance under both two- and three-talker conditions, addressing limitations of standard LLM-based SOT models in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SOP method effectively guides LLMs using structured prompts, demonstrating substantial performance gains in multi-talker ASR systems, particularly in challenging multi-speaker environments.

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised ASR approach that uses TV subtitles as context-rich prompts rather than direct supervision, with weighted attention mechanism for improved transcription accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TV subtitles are readily available but have imprecise alignment with audio, limiting their use as direct supervision for verbatim transcription in ASR systems.

Method: Reimagines subtitles as context-rich prompts instead of direct supervision, uses generated pseudo transcripts as primary targets with subtitles as guiding cues for iterative refinement, and introduces weighted attention mechanism to emphasize relevant subtitle tokens.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in transcription accuracy, showing effectiveness in refining transcripts.

Conclusion: The enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems, successfully addressing subtitle-audio alignment issues.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: One-shot hallucination detection method using entropy metrics from limited top token log-probabilities in black-box LLM APIs, achieving improved detection without multiple queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM outputs for QA tasks undermine reliability, especially in API-constrained scenarios with limited data access.

Method: Derives uncertainty indicators from available top token log-probabilities during non-greedy decoding, using Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric and supervised learning with entropic contribution features from single generated sequences.

Result: Significantly improves hallucination detection over EPR alone across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, using only small sets of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token).

Conclusion: Provides a practical, deployable technique to enhance LLM trustworthiness in QA and RAG systems with single generation pass, demonstrated effective in financial analysis applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: Hybrid NLP pipeline combining BioBERT sentiment analysis, lexical stress lexicon, and LDA topic modeling detects clinician burnout from ICU discharge summaries with 0.84 F1 score, outperforming metadata-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinician burnout threatens patient safety in ICUs, but existing methods rely on retrospective surveys or EHR metadata, missing valuable narrative insights from clinical notes.

Method: Analyzed 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV using hybrid pipeline: BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, lexical stress lexicon for burnout surveillance, and 5-topic LDA with workload proxies, followed by provider-level logistic regression.

Result: Achieved precision 0.80, recall 0.89, F1 score 0.84 on stratified hold-out set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by ≥0.17 F1. Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology providers showed elevated burnout risk.

Conclusion: ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring, demonstrating superior burnout detection compared to traditional metadata approaches.

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: LLMs show significant geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university recommendations, favoring Global North institutions and reinforcing gender stereotypes despite some model variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and quantify biases in LLM-based educational recommendations that risk perpetuating societal inequalities in higher education access.

Method: Empirical analysis using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, generating over 25,000 recommendations from three open-source LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B).

Result: Strong biases found: disproportionate favoritism toward Global North institutions, reinforcement of gender stereotypes, and high institutional repetition. LLaMA-3.1 showed highest diversity (481 unique universities across 58 countries) but systemic disparities persisted.

Conclusion: Urgent need for bias consideration in educational LLMs and development of multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks beyond accuracy to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

TL;DR: DeepTRACE is a novel audit framework that evaluates generative search engines and deep research LLM agents across 8 dimensions, revealing issues with overconfidence, weak sourcing, and citation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users regularly encounter problems with generative search engines and deep research agents showing overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices despite promises of trustworthy, source-grounded synthesis.

Method: DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition and confidence scoring) and builds citation/factual-support matrices to audit how systems reason with evidence. It employs automated extraction pipelines for popular models and an LLM-judge validated against human raters.

Result: Generative search engines produce one-sided, highly confident responses on debate queries with large fractions of unsupported statements. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence but remain one-sided, with citation accuracy ranging 40-80% across systems.

Conclusion: Current generative search and deep research systems have significant limitations in source attribution and citation accuracy, requiring improved frameworks like DeepTRACE for better evaluation and development of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show vulnerability to mixed contexts with inappropriate content, exhibiting a counterintuitive tendency to prioritize less prevalent information. The paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired approach (RW-Steering) that improves response quality by 39.8% through fine-tuning to ignore inappropriate signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world contexts often contain mixed relevant and inappropriate content, posing reliability risks for LLMs. Understanding how LLMs process and prioritize such mixed context is crucial for improving their safety and reliability in practical applications.

Method: Introduced Poisoned Context Testbed with real-world contexts containing both relevant and inappropriate content. Adapted the Rescorla-Wagner model from neuroscience to quantify contextual influence. Developed RW-Steering, a two-stage fine-tuning approach that enables models to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.

Result: LLMs exhibit consistent behavioral pattern: strong tendency to incorporate less prevalent information in context, making them vulnerable to small amounts of inappropriate content. RW-Steering improved response quality by 39.8% and reversed the undesirable behavior curve, demonstrating robust generalization across varying proportions of inappropriate content.

Conclusion: RW-Steering provides a robust, generalizable context engineering solution that significantly improves LLM safety in real-world settings by enabling models to effectively ignore inappropriate contextual signals without requiring extensive supervision across diverse context mixtures.

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Conclusion: The paper successfully delivers accessible explanations of complex instruction tuning algorithms by focusing on LLM-specific contexts and simplified notation, while also contributing new research directions through GRAPE.

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key

REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VaccineRAG is a Chain-of-Thought-based RAG dataset that addresses retrieval precision issues by evaluating models with varying positive/negative sample ratios and enhancing sample discrimination through explicit CoT analysis, combined with Partial-GRPO for better learning of complex reasoning sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG effectiveness is hindered by poor retrieval precision where many retrieved samples are irrelevant or misleading, creating a critical bottleneck for LLM performance.

Method: VaccineRAG uses benchmark evaluation with varying positive/negative sample ratios, prompts LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought analysis for each sample, and employs Partial-GRPO to model LLM outputs as multiple components for better preference selection in complex sequences.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in enhancing models' sample-discrimination capabilities and learning complex CoT content.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses RAG retrieval precision issues and enhances LLMs' ability to handle complex reasoning through systematic evaluation and improved learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Behavioral fingerprinting framework moves beyond traditional LLM benchmarks by analyzing nuanced behavioral characteristics like cognitive styles and interactive behaviors, revealing that while reasoning capabilities converge, alignment-related behaviors vary significantly across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks focus primarily on performance metrics but fail to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate models, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation approach.

Method: Uses a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and automated evaluation pipeline with a powerful LLM as impartial judge to analyze 18 models across capability tiers, creating multi-faceted behavioral profiles.

Result: Reveals critical divergence: core capabilities (abstract/causal reasoning) converge among top models, but alignment-related behaviors (sycophancy, semantic robustness) vary dramatically. Documents cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) reflecting common alignment incentives.

Conclusion: A model's interactive nature is not emergent from scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, highly variable developer alignment strategies. The framework provides reproducible methodology for uncovering deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

*Nithyashree Sivasubramaniam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhanced ASR framework combining transformer acoustic model with LLM post-processing achieves 16% relative WER reduction for silent speech interfaces


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent speech interfaces generate speech with phonetic ambiguity and noise, requiring improved recognition and downstream processing

Method: Transformer-based acoustic model captures full utterance context + large language model for linguistic consistency in post-processing

Result: 16% relative and 6% absolute WER reduction over 36% baseline, demonstrating substantial intelligibility improvements

Conclusion: Combining transformer acoustic models with LLM post-processing effectively addresses phonetic ambiguity and noise in silent speech synthesis

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

TL;DR: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) can outperform single large language model (LLM) systems in complex problems when using progressive sub-task training, achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness and efficiency of single-agent systems using large language models versus multi-agent systems using smaller language models for solving complex problems, and address the limitations of SLMs in long-trajectory learning.

Method: Instantiated single and multi-agent systems in the AppWorld environment using different sized language models. Introduced a progressive sub-task training strategy that introduces new sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch, similar to instance-level curriculum learning.

Result: Progressive training strategy consistently improved multi-agent effectiveness across all configurations. Fine-tuned multi-agent systems yielded better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs according to Pareto analysis, with reduced subtask error rates.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models, when trained with progressive sub-task training, provide a viable and efficient alternative to single large language model systems for complex problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

TL;DR: VR and AI can predict dyslexia in university students with 87.5% accuracy for Italian and 66.6% for Spanish using reading performance data from VR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether VR-derived data from reading tests and self-esteem assessments combined with machine learning can effectively differentiate between students with and without dyslexia.

Method: Used VR-based silent reading tests and self-esteem assessments, performed preliminary statistical analysis (t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests), then trained supervised machine learning models on the data.

Result: Significant differences found in completion time (but not accuracy or self-esteem) between dyslexic and non-dyslexic students. ML models achieved 87.5% accuracy for Italian, 66.6% for Spanish, and 75.0% for pooled data.

Conclusion: VR and ML can be effective supporting tools for dyslexia assessment, particularly through task completion speed differences, though language-specific factors affect classification accuracy.

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

TL;DR: Smaller LLMs with lightweight fine-tuning can achieve performance comparable to larger models in emotional safety classification tasks, enabling privacy-preserving on-device applications for mental health contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health applications where privacy and safety are paramount.

Method: Constructed a novel dataset by merging human-authored mental health datasets (>15K samples) with ChatGPT-generated emotion re-interpretation prompts. Evaluated four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings on trinary classification and multi-label safety risk taxonomy tasks.

Result: Larger LLMs showed stronger average performance, especially in nuanced multi-label classification and zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in high-data categories while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference.

Conclusion: Smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering emotional context interpretation and safe conversational boundaries maintenance, with implications for therapeutic LLM applications and scalable safety-critical system alignment.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BAME method uses model-generated explanations to reduce gender and ethnicity bias in AI-generated occupational stories by 2-20% through targeted prompt engineering without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models propagate social bias in gender and ethnicity representation, particularly in occupational stories, which can reinforce harmful stereotypes from training data.

Method: BAME (Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation) leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt engineering. Analyzed stories across 25 occupational groups using three LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4 Turbo) and multiple demographic dimensions.

Result: Improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20% after applying BAME. Identified persistent patterns of overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.

Conclusion: Guiding models with their own internal reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity and contribute to more transparent generative AI systems.

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Native Swahili-trained BERT model outperformed Swahili-to-English translated model by 4x fewer errors, showing translation alone doesn't bridge language representation gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether data disparities in multilingual LLMs disadvantage non-English speakers and if translation can bridge performance gaps between languages.

Method: Compared two monolingual BERT models: one trained/tested on Swahili data, and another on English news data. Translated Swahili data to English for evaluation on English model to simulate multilingual LLM processing.

Result: Native Swahili model performed significantly better with 0.36% errors vs 1.47% for translated model, despite high-quality translation.

Conclusion: Translation alone cannot overcome representational differences between languages. Native-language training remains crucial for reliable outcomes, and performance gaps may compound inequality in educational/informational contexts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

TL;DR: Analysis of patient emotional experiences after mesh implant surgery using NLP sentiment analysis on MAUDE database reports from 2000-2021, identifying patterns in emotional intensity and concern reports over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emotional aspects and patient experiences following mesh implantation surgeries, as postoperative complications remain a significant concern in hernia repair procedures.

Method: Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NRC Emotion Lexicon and TextBlob for sentiment analysis on patient reports from MAUDE database (2000-2021), categorizing narratives into eight emotions and assessing sentiment polarity.

Result: Detected increased Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during 2011-2012 and 2017-2018 periods, revealing temporal patterns in patient sentiment and urgent concerns.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights for healthcare practitioners to improve preoperative counseling and postoperative care, emphasizing the importance of emotional considerations in medical practice and the potential of sentiment analysis to enhance patient care.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

*Dhruvi Paprunia,Vansh Kharidia,Pankti Doshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) to improve tool-use capabilities in Small Language Models, making them more efficient and practical for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) struggle with tool use compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to limited training data and contextual understanding, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Employed Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs, providing an efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly boosted SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility for real-world applications while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RL-based approach (GRPO) effectively addresses SLMs' tool-use limitations, offering an efficient and adaptable solution that enhances their functionality for complex tasks requiring external tool integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

TL;DR: HSMP-BERT, a prompt-based model for extracting structured clinical information from Hebrew radiology reports, significantly outperforms baseline methods in Crohn's disease analysis with mean F1 of 0.83 and hierarchical inference that reduces runtime 5.1x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is challenging, especially in low-resource languages like Hebrew and for complex conditions like Crohn's disease with multi-organ findings.

Method: Developed Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based model trained on 512 radiologist-annotated Hebrew radiology reports with 90 structured labels per subject across 6 organs and 15 pathologies.

Result: HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1 0.83±0.08 and κ 0.65±0.17, significantly outperforming baseline methods (SMP zero-shot F1 0.49, standard fine-tuning F1 0.30). Hierarchical inference reduced runtime 5.1x and revealed clinical associations.

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT provides a scalable solution for structured extraction in radiology, enabling population-level Crohn's disease analysis and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: Using GPT to analyze 200,000+ Spanish newspaper articles about Colombia's armed conflict to create historical memory and study violence-coca eradication relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colombia lacks systematic documentation of decades of armed conflict, resulting in missing historical accounts and publicly available conflict information.

Method: Utilize GPT large language model to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related Spanish newspaper articles, then conduct descriptive analysis and study violence-coca crop eradication relationships.

Result: Created a dataset enabling policy analysis and demonstrated how LLMs enable deep examination of large text corpora previously infeasible to analyze at scale.

Conclusion: LLMs open new research opportunities by making large-scale text analysis feasible, contributing to Colombia's historical memory and supporting policy-relevant conflict studies.

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

TL;DR: Quantization enables deployment of large language models on consumer GPUs with 75% memory reduction while maintaining performance in biomedical NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face adoption barriers in healthcare due to size, computational requirements, and data privacy concerns that prevent cloud deployment.

Method: Systematically evaluated quantization impact on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs (general and biomedical-specific) across 8 benchmark datasets covering 4 key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering.

Result: Quantization reduces GPU memory requirements by up to 75% while preserving model performance, enabling deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB consumer-grade GPUs. Domain knowledge and prompt responsiveness are largely maintained.

Conclusion: Quantization is a practical and effective strategy for secure local deployment of large language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the gap between AI advances and clinical translation.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

*Osman Batur İnce,André F. T. Martins,Oisin Mac Aodha,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMI enables sample-efficient integration of new modalities into LLMs using a hypernetwork trained on high-resource modalities, achieving 64x data efficiency compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modality integration requires significant paired data and training from scratch, which is unfeasible for low-resource modalities and evolving modality spaces.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork conditioned on few samples to adapt a shared projector between modality encoders and LLM. Increases training diversity through isometric transformations of encoders.

Result: Achieves significant sample efficiency boost - 32-shot SEMI matches accuracy of 2048-shot training from scratch (64x improvement). Works across diverse modalities like satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules.

Conclusion: SEMI enables efficient extension of foundation model modality coverage, making it practical to integrate low-resource and emerging modalities with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework for controlling transformer language models through interventions at prompt, activation, and weight levels, achieving >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks but lack fine-grained control, making it challenging to manipulate their behavior precisely for specific applications.

Method: The paper formalizes controllable text generation as an optimization problem and introduces a unified framework using prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning across three intervention levels: prompts, activations, and weights.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate >90% success rate in sentiment control and factual edits while maintaining base model performance, though trade-offs between generalization and specificity exist. Theoretically, minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.

Conclusion: The work establishes groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models, but also highlights ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation to address safety implications including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

### [124] [Spoken in Jest, Detected in Earnest: A Systematic Review of Sarcasm Recognition -- Multimodal Fusion, Challenges, and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04605)
*Xiyuan Gao,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic review on speech-based sarcasm recognition, covering evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches, datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm poses challenges in human-machine interactions, and while text-based detection has been studied, speech data for sarcasm recognition remains underexplored despite prosodic cues being important for conveying sarcastic intent.

Method: Systematic review analyzing datasets, feature extraction techniques (from traditional acoustic features to deep learning representations), and classification methods (from unimodal to multimodal fusion approaches).

Result: Identified limitations in sarcasm recognition datasets, documented evolution of feature extraction and classification techniques, and highlighted gaps in cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition.

Conclusion: Sarcasm should be addressed as a multimodal phenomenon rather than text-based, with need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual approaches in speech-based sarcasm recognition.

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on prompt-based attacks against LLMs, categorizing attack methodologies and providing threat models to inform development of secure LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security challenges from adversarial prompt manipulation that can bypass safety alignments, cause harm, and exploit vulnerabilities in LLM design and training.

Method: Comprehensive literature survey and systematic categorization of prompt-based attack methodologies to establish clear threat models.

Result: Detailed analysis of attack mechanisms and impacts, providing foundational understanding for developing countermeasures against unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.

Conclusion: Systematic understanding of prompt-based attacks is essential for building next-generation LLMs that are inherently resistant to security threats and maintain user trust.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

### [126] [Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models in Disaster Tweet Classification for Public Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04650)
*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models like BERT outperform traditional ML models for disaster tweet classification, achieving 91% accuracy vs 82% for Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes due to better contextual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms provide real-time disaster information, but traditional ML models fail to understand context and informal language in tweets, limiting emergency response effectiveness.

Method: Evaluated transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) against traditional ML approaches (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) for classifying disaster-related tweets.

Result: BERT achieved highest accuracy of 91%, significantly outperforming traditional models (82% for Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes). Transformer models better understand subtle language through contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real-world social media text compared to traditional ML models.

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

*Lee Kezar,Zed Sehyr,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates phonological inductive biases to improve vector-quantized autoencoder performance for sign language recognition and reconstruction, particularly for unseen signs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language datasets often lack vocabulary representativeness, creating a need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization shows promise but may capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance.

Method: The study proposes two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement (architectural bias) and Phonological Semi-Supervision (regularization technique), implemented with a vector-quantized autoencoder for isolated sign recognition.

Result: The learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can significantly improve the generalization of learned representations for sign language, providing better performance on both known and unseen signs.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

*Ayush Gupta,Ramneet Kaur,Anirban Roy,Adam D. Cobb,Rama Chellappa,Susmit Jha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel inference-time OOD detection method for specialized LLMs using dropout tolerance and conformal anomaly detection framework


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized LLMs achieve SOTA performance on in-domain tasks but remain vulnerable to incorrect outputs with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications

Method: Leverages Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) with new non-conformity measure based on model's dropout tolerance, aggregating across multiple layers via valid ensemble approach

Result: Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show better OOD detection than baselines, with AUROC improvements of 2% to 37%

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively detects OOD inputs while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds, addressing critical reliability concerns for specialized LLMs

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

*Aisha Alansari,Hamzah Luqman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of hallucination in Arabic and multilingual LLMs on Arabic question answering and summarization tasks, revealing Arabic-specific models outperform multilingual ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination research has focused mainly on English, leaving Arabic LLMs underexplored despite Arabic's widespread use and importance in global communication.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs (4 Arabic pre-trained, 4 multilingual, 4 reasoning-based) using a fine-grained framework with 12 hallucination indicators on generative question answering and summarization tasks.

Result: Factual hallucinations were more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models. Arabic pre-trained model Allam showed lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and comparable performance to reasoning-based models.

Conclusion: Arabic-specific LLMs demonstrate superior performance in reducing hallucinations compared to multilingual models, highlighting the importance of language-specific training for Arabic NLP tasks.

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes schema-aligned paraphrasing framework to evaluate NL2SQL model robustness to linguistic variation, revealing significant performance drops in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't systematically evaluate NL2SQL model robustness to linguistic variation, which is crucial for understanding generalization capabilities in real-world settings.

Method: Novel schema-aligned paraphrasing framework leveraging SQL-to-NL to automatically generate semantically equivalent but lexically diverse queries while maintaining schema and intent alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant brittleness: LLaMa3.3-70B drops 10.23% in execution accuracy, LLaMa3.1-8B drops nearly 20%, with smaller models disproportionately affected. Performance degradation varies by query complexity, dataset, and domain.

Conclusion: There's a critical need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable NL2SQL performance in real-world applications, as current benchmarks underestimate model brittleness.

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

### [131] [Why Language Models Hallucinate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664)
*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models hallucinate because training and evaluation reward guessing over admitting uncertainty, stemming from binary classification errors and misaligned benchmark scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs undermine trust and persist even in state-of-the-art systems, requiring understanding of their statistical origins and addressing misaligned evaluation incentives.

Method: Analyze statistical causes of hallucinations in modern training pipelines, showing they originate from binary classification errors where incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts.

Result: Hallucinations arise naturally through statistical pressures and persist because evaluations penalize uncertain responses, rewarding guessing behavior that improves test performance.

Conclusion: Addressing hallucinations requires socio-technical mitigation by modifying scoring of existing misaligned benchmarks rather than introducing additional evaluations, steering toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: Maintaining fresh and complete knowledge graphs is costly, and traditional methods struggle with coverage and update lag.

Method: Combines modular components: Extraction Initiator, Evidence Retriever, hybrid Knowledge Extractors (pattern rules + LLM prompting), lightweight Grounder, and Corroborator with ontology-guided validation.

Result: Processed 9M+ Wikipedia pages, ingested 19M high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision, achieved 48% overlap with third-party KGs, and reduced update lag by 50 days.

Conclusion: LLM-based extraction grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows enables trustworthy, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

TL;DR: KERAG is a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that improves question answering coverage by retrieving broader subgraphs and using fine-tuned LLMs for reasoning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7% and GPT-4o by 10-21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KGQA methods suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and semantic ambiguity in semantic parsing approaches, limiting their effectiveness in retrieving relevant knowledge for question answering.

Method: A retrieval-filtering-summarization pipeline that retrieves broader subgraphs likely to contain relevant information, combined with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs to reduce noise.

Result: KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21% in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed KERAG approach effectively enhances QA coverage and performance by addressing limitations of traditional KGQA methods through broader knowledge retrieval and improved reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Motivation: Current end-to-end In-Image Machine Translation research mainly uses synthetic data with simple backgrounds, single fonts, fixed text positions, and bilingual translation, creating a significant gap between research and practical real-world conditions.

Method: The authors annotate the PRIM dataset containing real-world captured one-line text images with complex backgrounds, various fonts, diverse text positions, and multilingual translation support. They propose VisTrans, an end-to-end model that processes visual text and background information separately to handle practical conditions while ensuring multilingual translation capability and improved visual quality.

Result: Experimental results show that VisTrans achieves better translation quality and visual effects compared to other models.

Conclusion: The work facilitates research on In-Image Machine Translation in real-world scenarios by providing the PRIM dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the VisTrans model for practical multilingual translation tasks with complex visual conditions.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

TL;DR: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be optimized for extracting patient information from clinical narratives, comparing different architectures, fine-tuning methods, and multi-task instruction tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have revolutionized clinical NLP but their optimal use for patient information extraction requires further exploration to develop robust and generalizable systems.

Method: Benchmarked encoder-based (BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1, GatorTronLlama) LLMs across five datasets, comparing full fine-tuning vs prompt-based PEFT, and evaluated multi-task instruction tuning using leave-one-dataset-out strategy.

Result: The study systematically evaluated LLM performance on clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, examining architecture differences, fine-tuning efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into optimal LLM architectures and training strategies for clinical information extraction, contributing to more effective healthcare NLP applications.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-hop question decomposition method significantly improves LLM performance on complex questions, outperforming direct answering approaches both before and after fine-tuning with LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately answering complex questions with Large Language Models by leveraging question decomposition techniques.

Method: Proposed multi-hop question decomposition method using LLAMA3 model, converted MQUAKE-T dataset into single-hop and multi-hop formats, fine-tuned with LoRA, and conducted inference tests.

Result: Multi-hop decomposition significantly outperformed direct answering without fine-tuning. After LoRA fine-tuning, both methods improved but multi-hop maintained superiority.

Conclusion: Multi-hop question decomposition effectively enhances LLM's complex question answering capability both pre- and post-training, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex

### [138] [Decoders Laugh as Loud as Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04779)
*Eli Borodach,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4o performs nearly as well as RoBERTa in humor understanding tasks, achieving F1-macro scores of 0.85 vs 0.86, suggesting LLMs can understand nuanced humor despite questions about their true comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models truly understand nuanced themes like humor, building on Turing's vision of human-like AI communication and addressing the open question of computer humor comprehension.

Method: Fine-tuned GPT-4o (decoder model) and compared its performance against fine-tuned RoBERTa (encoder model) on humor understanding tasks using F1-macro scores as evaluation metrics.

Result: GPT-4o achieved a Mean F1-macro score of 0.85, performing nearly as well as the best fine-tuned encoder model RoBERTa which scored 0.86, demonstrating comparable humor understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Modern large language models like GPT-4o can understand and process humor at levels comparable to specialized encoder models, suggesting significant progress in AI's ability to comprehend nuanced linguistic themes despite ongoing questions about true understanding.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

### [139] [Enhancing Diversity in Large Language Models via Determinantal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04784)
*Yilei Chen,Souradip Chakraborty,Lorenz Wolf,Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis,Aldo Pacchiano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DQO is a novel training method that uses determinantal point processes to optimize LLMs for both quality and semantic diversity, addressing the diversity loss issue in supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods like supervised fine-tuning and RL often reduce output diversity, leading to narrow canonical responses. Current diversity enhancement methods are limited to inference-time operations or focus only on lexical differences.

Method: Proposes DQO method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) that samples multiple responses per prompt, embeds them, and uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to measure semantic diversity as the volume spanned by response embeddings.

Result: Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and reasoning tasks show substantial improvement in semantic diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Conclusion: DQO effectively addresses the diversity loss problem in LLM post-training by jointly optimizing for quality and semantic diversity through a novel DPP-based approach.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

### [140] [Personality as a Probe for LLM Evaluation: Method Trade-offs and Downstream Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04794)
*Gunmay Handa,Zekun Wu,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic study of personality manipulation in LLMs using Big Five traits, comparing three methods (ICL, PEFT, MS) with comprehensive evaluation framework and trait purification techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personality manipulation in LLMs is increasingly used in customer service and agentic scenarios, but the mechanisms and trade-offs remain unclear, requiring systematic investigation.

Method: Constructed contrastive dataset for balanced trait responses, developed unified evaluation framework with Δ analysis, implemented trait purification techniques, and proposed three-level stability framework. Compared in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS) on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Result: Clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers highest alignment but degrades task performance, MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Openness is uniquely challenging, agreeableness most resistant to ICL, personality encoding consolidates around intermediate layers.

Conclusion: Personality manipulation serves as multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering. Mechanistic steering emerges as lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

### [141] [Knowledge Collapse in LLMs: When Fluency Survives but Facts Fail under Recursive Synthetic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04796)
*Figarri Keisha,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic training on model-generated outputs causes knowledge collapse - factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating "confidently wrong" outputs. The collapse depends on instruction format, and domain-specific synthetic training can mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of model collapse in large language models when trained recursively on synthetic data, which threatens factual reliability in accuracy-dependent domains.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, analyzed collapse trajectory based on instruction format, and proposed domain-specific synthetic training as mitigation. Used evaluation framework combining model-centric indicators and task-centric metrics.

Result: Demonstrated that collapse timing and trajectory critically depend on instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from traditional model collapse. Domain-specific synthetic training achieved substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into collapse dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount, with a reproducible assessment framework for epistemic deterioration.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

### [142] [Mind the Gap: Evaluating Model- and Agentic-Level Vulnerabilities in LLMs with Action Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04802)
*Ilham Wicaksono,Zekun Wu,Theo King,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSeer is a new framework for evaluating safety risks in AI agents that reveals vulnerabilities invisible to traditional model-level testing, showing agent-specific risks are 24-60% higher than model-level vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation frameworks have critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks as large language models transition to agentic systems, requiring specialized evaluation methods for agentic contexts.

Method: AgentSeer decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs for systematic assessment. Cross-model validation was conducted on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks.

Result: Agentic-level assessment exposed agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher attack success rates. Cross-model analysis revealed universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, and context-dependent attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The findings establish an urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing standardized methodology and empirical validation for assessing agent-specific security risks.

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

### [143] [Analyzing Finnish Inflectional Classes through Discriminative Lexicon and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04813)
*Alexandre Nikolaev,Yu-Ying Chuang,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study tests whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model can handle Finnish noun inflection without using traditional inflectional classes, achieving good accuracy on both training and test data while showing sensitivity to inflectional class productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether inflectional classes are cognitively necessary for language learning, or whether computational models can learn proper noun inflection without explicit class information.

Method: Used Discriminative Lexicon Model with 55,271 inflected Finnish nouns from 2000 high-frequency nouns across 49 inflectional classes. Tested both endstate learning (infinite exposure) and frequency-informed learning (usage-based) approaches.

Result: Models achieved high accuracy on training data and acceptable accuracy on test data. Performance correlated with inflectional class productivity - better with productive classes, worse with unproductive classes. Frequency was dominant predictor for usage-based production models.

Conclusion: The Discriminative Lexicon Model can successfully learn Finnish noun inflection without explicit inflectional classes, suggesting such classes may not be cognitively necessary for language acquisition.

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

### [144] [AFD-SLU: Adaptive Feature Distillation for Spoken Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04821)
*Yan Xie,Yibo Cui,Liang Xie,Erwei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Feature Distillation framework for SLU that transfers knowledge from GTE teacher to lightweight student using dynamic adapter and adaptive distillation coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in SLU development including scarcity of labeled training data and computational burden of deploying LLMs in real-world applications.

Method: Uses Adaptive Feature Distillation with dynamic adapter (Residual Projection Neural Network) to align feature spaces and Dynamic Distillation Coefficient that modulates distillation strength based on real-time performance feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Chinese ProSLU benchmark: 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score, and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed AFD-SLU framework effectively addresses data scarcity and computational efficiency issues in SLU systems while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

### [145] [Memorization $\neq$ Understanding: Do Large Language Models Have the Ability of Scenario Cognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04866)
*Boxiang Ma,Ru Li,Yuanlong Wang,Hongye Tan,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show impressive performance but lack deep semantic understanding, relying mainly on memorization rather than true scenario cognition as revealed through a novel bi-perspective evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' generalization capabilities stem from genuine semantic understanding or mere memorization of training data, specifically examining their ability to comprehend scenarios by linking semantic elements with arguments in context.

Method: Proposed a bi-perspective evaluation framework using a novel scenario-based dataset with fictional facts annotated with scenario elements. Evaluated LLMs through: 1) scenario-related question answering (output perspective), and 2) probing internal representations for scenario element-argument associations (internal representation perspective).

Result: Current LLMs predominantly rely on superficial memorization and fail to achieve robust semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases, exposing critical limitations in their semantic understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings reveal fundamental weaknesses in LLMs' semantic cognition and provide important cognitive insights for developing more advanced language models with genuine understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

*Sylvia Vassileva,Ivan Koychev,Svetla Boytcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated ICD-10 coding system using LLMs with dictionary matching and GPT-4.1 for clinical text analysis in multiple languages


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify healthcare professionals' work and ensure consistent disease coding in hospitals by automating ICD-10 code assignment from clinical texts

Method: Multistage pipeline combining clinical dictionary matching for unambiguous terms and in-context learning with GPT-4.1 for complex cases

Result: High performance across languages: 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 for subcategories on Spanish CodiEsp dataset, 0.85 F1 on Greek ElCardioCC dataset

Conclusion: LLM-based approach effectively automates clinical entity linking to ICD-10 codes across different languages with promising accuracy

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

*Raul Singh,Nicolo Brunello,Vincenzo Scotti,Mark James Carman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: L1RA is a novel technique that dynamically distributes rank allocation in low-rank adapters during LLM fine-tuning using L1 regularization to optimize resource usage within a rank budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational requirements and resource limitations in fine-tuning large language models by optimizing rank distribution in low-rank adapters.

Method: Uses L1 regularization to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters during fine-tuning with LoRA, given a total rank budget constraint.

Result: Maintains comparable or reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants while achieving same or better performance. Identifies feed-forward layers and attention output projection as requiring most adaptation.

Conclusion: L1RA effectively enhances LLM fine-tuning efficiency and provides diagnostic insights for model refinement, making it particularly valuable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Conclusion: PLaMo 2 demonstrates that efficient architecture design, synthetic data generation, and optimized training pipelines can produce high-performance Japanese language models that rival much larger models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large
language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to
full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.
Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured
pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves
performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and
quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve
state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized
open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific
knowledge.

*Jianghao Chen,Wei Sun,Qixiang Yin,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE-RL framework uses adaptive constraint-enhanced reinforcement learning to improve long-form generation by automatically identifying fine-grained constraints from instructions and converting subjective quality evaluation into measurable constraint verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current LLMs in high-quality long-form generation, including heavy reliance on scarce high-quality training data and focus on coarse-grained quality metrics that overlook scenario-specific fine-grained requirements.

Method: Proposes ACE-RL framework that: 1) automatically deconstructs instructions into fine-grained adaptive constraint criteria, 2) designs reward mechanism quantifying response quality based on constraint satisfaction, 3) uses reinforcement learning to guide models toward better long-form generation.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, with top model surpassing GPT-4o by 7.10%.

Conclusion: ACE-RL provides an effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios by converting subjective quality evaluation into measurable constraint verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

*Midhun Shyam,Jim Basilakis,Kieran Luken,Steven Thomas,John Crozier,Paul M. Middleton,X. Rosalind Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A pipeline for classifying sensitive triage data using limited compute resources by fine-tuning LLMs with small datasets on GPU then CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triage notes contain valuable medical information but face challenges: privacy regulations requiring on-site analysis, lack of hardware for LLM training, and costly manual labeling by experts.

Method: Fine-tuned pre-trained LLM with classifier using 2k open-source dataset on GPU, then further fine-tuned with hospital-specific 1000-sample dataset on CPU.

Result: Successfully classified triage data with limited compute resources through careful dataset curation and leveraging existing models.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables effective triage data classification despite hardware limitations and privacy constraints by strategically using small datasets and staged fine-tuning.

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

*Julius Neumann,Robert Lange,Yuni Susanti,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small Transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) evaluated for multi-label sentiment classification in short texts. Data augmentation helps, continued pre-training on augmented data adds noise, classification head changes provide minimal benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short text sentiment classification faces challenges like class imbalance, limited training samples, subjectivity, and data sparsity due to limited context, making effective learning difficult.

Method: Evaluated three factors: (1) continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) generative data augmentation using automatically generated examples, (3) architectural variations of classification head on BERT/RoBERTa models (<1B parameters).

Result: Data augmentation improves classification performance, continued pre-training on augmented datasets introduces noise rather than boosting accuracy, and classification head modifications yield only marginal benefits.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained settings and refining strategies for short-text sentiment classification, with data augmentation being most effective approach.

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

TL;DR: Comparative study on whether explicit intent recognition is necessary for service response generation, testing Intent-First vs Direct Response Generation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental design dilemma in conversational AI - whether explicit intent recognition is a prerequisite for high-quality service responses or if models can generate effective replies directly without this step.

Method: Used two publicly available service interaction datasets to benchmark state-of-the-art language models (including fine-tuned T5 variant) across both Intent-First Response Generation and Direct Response Generation paradigms.

Result: Revealed surprising insights about the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modeling, with evaluation covering both linguistic quality and task success rates.

Conclusion: Findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines and offer actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective response generation systems.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective
response generation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a data-efficient training approach for language modeling under strict data constraints, exploring diffusion-based methods as an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches.

Method: Applies diffusion training objectives with frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens, explores multiple noise scheduling strategies including two-mode approaches, and investigates different noise weighting schemes within the NELBO objective.

Result: Achieves performance competitive to hybrid autoregressive-masked baselines on the BabyLM benchmark suite across linguistic competence, world knowledge, and human-likeness metrics.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based training offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning, demonstrating effectiveness under strict data constraints.

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient

*Patrick Amadeus Irawan,Ryandito Diandaru,Belati Jagad Bintang Syuhada,Randy Zakya Suchrady,Alham Fikri Aji,Genta Indra Winata,Fajri Koto,Samuel Cahyawijaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec is a novel framework that uses language model entropy to create cross-lingual representations, capturing typological relationships through prediction uncertainty rather than traditional sparse typological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional typological inventories suffer from feature sparsity and provide static snapshots, limiting their effectiveness for capturing dynamic language relationships and creating robust cross-lingual representations.

Method: Train language models on individual languages and use the entropy of their predictions as a measure of structural similarity - low entropy indicates high similarity to other languages, while high entropy suggests divergence, creating dense language embeddings.

Result: Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established typological categories and achieve competitive performance in downstream multilingual NLP tasks, particularly those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages language model uncertainty to create adaptable, non-sparse language embeddings that capture typological relationships effectively across different timeframes without missing values.

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

*Matteo Bortoletto,Constantin Ruhdorfer,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToM-SSI is a new multimodal benchmark that tests Theory of Mind capabilities in complex social interactions with up to 4 agents, moving beyond traditional text-only Sally-Anne tests to capture richer social cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks are limited to simple text-only or dyadic interactions using Sally-Anne test variations, which fail to capture the complexity of real human social interactions and spatial dynamics.

Method: Proposed ToM-SSI benchmark that is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to four agents that communicate and move in situated environments, enabling study of mixed cooperative-obstructive settings and parallel reasoning about multiple agents' mental states.

Result: Evaluations show current models' performance is severely limited, especially in these new complex tasks involving group interactions and spatial dynamics.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals critical gaps in current foundation models' Theory of Mind capabilities and highlights the need for future research to address these limitations in complex social reasoning.

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

*Zhiyu Cao,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ICR framework for conversational query rewriting using iterative clarification questions instead of end-to-end approach to handle multiple fuzzy expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end query rewriting struggles with multiple fuzzy expressions in queries, making simultaneous identification and rewriting difficult.

Method: ICR framework with iterative process alternating between generating clarification questions and rewritten queries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets with continuous retrieval improvement through iterative process.

Conclusion: Iterative clarification-based rewriting effectively addresses multiple fuzzy expression issues in conversational queries.

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

*David Herrera-Poyatos,Carlos Peláez-González,Cristina Zuheros,Virilo Tejedor,Rosana Montes,Francisco Herrera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAXAL is a triadic framework for explainable AI that unites cognitive, functional, and causal dimensions to provide role-sensitive explanations for agentic LLMs in high-risk domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explainability methods fail to capture the reasoning pathways and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs, undermining trust and accountability in high-risk deployment domains.

Method: TAXAL framework integrates three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). It synthesizes existing methods like post-hoc attribution, dialogic interfaces, and explanation-aware prompting.

Result: The framework demonstrates applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles.

Conclusion: TAXAL advances explainability as both technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

*Mao Zheng,Zheng Li,Bingxin Qu,Mingyang Song,Yang Du,Mingrui Sun,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hunyuan-MT-7B is a multilingual translation model supporting 33 languages with special focus on Mandarin-minority language/dialect translation. Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B enhances performance through slow-thinking integration of multiple outputs, achieving SOTA results in WMT2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop open-source multilingual translation models that excel at bidirectional translation across 33 languages, with particular emphasis on supporting translation between Mandarin and ethnic minority languages/dialects that are often underrepresented.

Method: Holistic training process: general and MT-oriented pre-training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Chimera model integrates multiple outputs from base model under varying parameters using slow-thinking approach.

Result: Significantly outperforms all comparable translation-specific models and most SOTA large models. Ranked first in 30 out of 31 language pairs in WMT2025 shared task. Excellent performance on both high-resource (Chinese, English, Japanese) and low-resource languages (Czech, Marathi, Estonian, Icelandic).

Conclusion: The Hunyuan-MT models demonstrate robust multilingual translation capabilities across diverse linguistic spectrum, with Chimera's slow-thinking integration approach proving superior to conventional Chain-of-Thought methods for translation tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

*Medhasweta Sen,Zachary Gottesman,Jiaxing Qiu,C. Bayan Bruss,Nam Nguyen,Tom Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized benchmark for evaluating time series foundation models on 3 natural language tasks (recognition, differentiation, generation) using unified datasets, revealing that VLMs outperform LLMs but all models show robustness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in existing evaluations where models are often introduced with new datasets, limiting direct comparisons and obscuring which capabilities contribute to overall performance in time series analysis.

Method: Formalized 3 natural language description tasks for time series, unified 4 recent datasets, and evaluated 13 state-of-the-art models (language, vision-language, and time series-language models) on recognition, differentiation, and generation tasks.

Result: Language-only methods underperform significantly, vision-language models perform well, and pretrained multimodal time series-language models outperform LLMs but still have room for improvement. All models show fragility in robustness tests.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides standardized evaluation for time series reasoning systems, demonstrating the need for time series-specific architectures and revealing current limitations in model robustness across different natural language tasks.

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

### [160] [HoPE: Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding for Stable Long-Range Dependency Modeling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05218)
*Chang Dai,Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Di Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE is a new positional encoding method that uses hyperbolic geometry to fix RoPE's oscillation issues, enabling better long-range dependency modeling and outperforming existing methods on long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encodings struggle with long sequences - absolute encodings can't extrapolate, relative methods degrade on extreme lengths, and RoPE has oscillatory patterns that hinder stable long-distance modeling.

Method: Proposes Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE) inspired by Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, using hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations.

Result: HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's oscillation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with distance. Extensive experiments show HoPE consistently exceeds existing methods on extended sequence benchmarks.

Conclusion: HoPE demonstrates enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies, with theoretical analysis showing RoPE is a special case of this generalized formulation.

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

*Abdul Waheed,Chancharik Mitra,Laurie Z. Wang,Deva Ramanan,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that enables models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity without architectural changes, using carefully curated training data with proportional chain-of-thought traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning often produces unnecessarily verbose output for simpler problems, creating inefficiency in model reasoning processes.

Method: Post-training models on carefully curated data that includes chain-of-thought traces proportional to problem difficulty, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) techniques.

Result: Models learn to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, reducing reasoning length for simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones. SFT captures reasoning length/format patterns, while DPO preserves reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Models can be taught to "think proportionally" - reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining appropriate depth for complex ones, achieving efficiency gains without compromising performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

*Aysenur Kocak,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CURE is a lightweight framework that disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts in pre-trained language models while preserving essential content, achieving significant performance improvements on IMDB and Yelp datasets with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models are susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness, requiring methods to address these biases without losing task-relevant information.

Method: Uses a content extractor with reversal network to get concept-irrelevant representations, followed by a controllable debiasing module with contrastive learning to adjust residual conceptual cues based on task needs.

Result: Achieves +10 points F1 improvement on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp across three pre-trained architectures with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CURE provides a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, enabling more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

*Hailin Hao,Elsi Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Replication study confirms that English complementizer 'that' omission follows Uniform Information Density principles, with more predictable clauses showing higher omission rates, and finds neural language models outperform traditional measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and advance research on the Uniform Information Density hypothesis by examining complementizer 'that' omission patterns using modern computational methods and large conversational data.

Method: Analyzed a large-scale contemporary conversational corpus using machine learning and neural language models to refine information density estimates, comparing traditional subcategorization probability measures with contextual word embeddings.

Result: Replicated established relationship between information density and 'that'-mentioning, found traditional measures capture lexical variation while neural models account for additional variance in complementizer usage patterns.

Conclusion: Contextual word embeddings provide superior estimates of information density compared to traditional measures, supporting the Uniform Information Density hypothesis in language production.

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

*Zhen Qin,Xuyang Shen,Yiran Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of decay mechanisms in linear complexity sequence models across four dimensions: parameterization strategy, parameter sharing, decay granularity, and RoPE compatibility, revealing key design constraints and performance insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively investigate decay mechanisms in linear complexity sequence models and systematically delineate the design space to understand optimal configurations and performance impacts.

Method: Extensive experiments on diverse language modeling tasks analyzing four dimensions: parameterization strategy (computational methodology), parameter sharing (use of supplementary parameters), decay granularity (scalar vs vector-based), and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods like RoPE.

Result: Found that effective parameterization strategies are confined to specific parameter ranges; parameter sharing cannot be arbitrary as it causes decay value issues; scalar decay generally underperforms vector decay but can surpass it in certain scenarios; RoPE typically fails to benefit most linear attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Decay mechanism design requires careful consideration across multiple dimensions, with specific constraints on parameterization strategies and sharing approaches, and relative positional encoding methods like RoPE offer limited benefits to linear attention models.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using sparse crosscoders to track linguistic feature evolution during LLM pretraining, with a novel RelIE metric to identify when features become causally important.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarking fails to reveal how language models acquire specific linguistic concepts and capabilities during pretraining.

Method: Train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with performance shifts, using Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE) metric to trace feature importance across training stages.

Result: Crosscoders successfully detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining, providing fine-grained analysis of representation learning.

Conclusion: This architecture-agnostic and scalable approach offers a promising path toward more interpretable analysis of how linguistic features evolve throughout pretraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

*Oliver Dunn,Koorosh Aslansefat,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SafeML introduces quantum-adapted safety monitoring for Quantum Machine Learning using quantum state distance measures to detect concept drift and ensure model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety monitoring methods for classical ML are not applicable to QML due to fundamental differences in quantum computation, and dedicated safety mechanisms for QML remain underdeveloped.

Method: Adapts SafeML approach with quantum-centric distance measures that align with probabilistic QML outputs, using model-dependent post-classification evaluation with distance metrics defined over quantum state spaces.

Result: Successfully detects distances between operational and training data to address concept drifts in QML, demonstrated through experiments on QCNN and VQC models.

Conclusion: Q-SafeML enables informed human oversight and enhances system transparency and safety in quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human

### [167] [Finance-Grounded Optimization For Algorithmic Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04541)
*Kasymkhan Khubiev,Mikhail Semenov,Irina Podlipnova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning models with financially-grounded loss functions (Sharpe ratio, PnL, Max Drawdown) and turnover regularization outperform traditional MSE for trading strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical deep learning approaches perform well in NLP, CV, and forecasting but are not optimal for finance where specialists use different performance metrics. There's a need for interpretable AI that aligns with financial evaluation standards.

Method: Proposed financially grounded loss functions derived from key quantitative finance metrics (Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss, Maximum Drawdown) and introduced turnover regularization to constrain position turnover within predefined limits.

Result: The proposed loss functions with turnover regularization outperform traditional mean squared error loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading metrics.

Conclusion: Financially grounded metrics enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization, making deep learning more suitable for financial applications.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [169] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExIt is an autocurriculum RL method that trains LLMs for multi-step self-improvement by selectively sampling informative intermediate steps during training, enabling effective inference-time iteration beyond training depths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches for self-improvement tasks assume fixed maximum iteration depths, which can be costly and arbitrary. There's a need for methods that can train agents to perform reliable multi-step self-improvement at inference-time.

Method: Exploratory Iteration (ExIt) grows a task space by selectively sampling the most informative intermediate partial histories during episodes, treating these as new self-iteration task instances to train a self-improvement policy. It can pair with exploration mechanisms for greater task diversity.

Result: Across competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and machine learning engineering domains, ExIt produces policies that show strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out tasks and can iterate towards higher performance beyond the average training iteration depth.

Conclusion: ExIt effectively enables LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at inference-time by training only on the most informative single-step iterations, demonstrating scalable self-improvement capabilities across diverse domains.

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

### [170] [Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583)
*Jiequn Han,Kui Ren,Nathan Soedjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for efficient training of inverse problem solvers that dynamically allocates sampling effort based on specific test instances rather than using fixed datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based inverse problem approaches require large training datasets from prior distributions, which becomes costly when priors have high intrinsic dimensions or high accuracy is needed. This motivates adaptive sampling to reduce data collection costs.

Method: Iterative framework that dynamically refines training datasets conditioned on the latest prediction, tailoring the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each specific test instance.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in inverse scattering problems with structured priors, showing significant sample efficiency gains that become more pronounced with complex priors or higher accuracy requirements.

Conclusion: The adaptive sampling strategy provides a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training, broadly applicable to various inverse problems beyond the tested scattering applications.

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

*Han Zhang,Fengji Ma,Jiamin Su,Xinyue Yang,Lei Wang,Wen-Cai Ye,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new multi-task learning framework called QW-MTL that uses quantum chemical descriptors and adaptive task weighting to improve ADMET prediction performance across 13 TDC benchmarks, outperforming single-task baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-task learning methods for ADMET prediction fail to exploit task complementarities and require more computational resources for independent training and inference of each task.

Method: Proposes QW-MTL framework built on Chemprop-RDKit backbone with quantum chemical descriptors for enriched molecular representations and an exponential task weighting scheme that combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters for dynamic loss balancing.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-task baselines on 12 out of 13 TDC classification benchmarks, achieving high predictive performance with minimal model complexity and fast inference.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed features and adaptive task weighting for ADMET prediction tasks.

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

### [173] [Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of representational similarity metrics shows that metrics with more stringent alignment constraints provide better discriminative power for separating different model families, with soft-matching performing best among mapping-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparisons of representational similarity metrics' discriminative power across different model families and training regimes in neuroscience and AI research.

Method: Developed a quantitative framework using three separability measures (dprime, silhouette coefficients, ROC-AUC) to evaluate commonly used similarity metrics (RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, soft matching) across various architectures and training regimes.

Result: Separability increases with more stringent alignment constraints; soft-matching achieved highest separability among mapping-based approaches, followed by Procrustes and linear predictivity; non-fitting methods like RSA also showed strong separability.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and offering guidance for metric selection in large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

### [174] [Split Conformal Prediction in the Function Space with Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04623)
*David Millard,Lars Lindemann,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends split conformal prediction to function spaces with finite-sample coverage guarantees for neural operators by discretizing output space and lifting guarantees through asymptotic convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators lack finite-sample coverage guarantees for functional outputs, and existing methods require strong assumptions or yield conservative coverage. Conformal prediction doesn't directly extend to function-valued outputs.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Establish finite-sample coverage in finite-dimensional space using discretization map, 2) Lift guarantees to function-space through asymptotic convergence analysis. Includes regression-based correction for resolution transfer and diagnostic metrics for autoregressive settings.

Result: Method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Successfully extends conformal prediction to function spaces, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees for neural operators while addressing resolution effects through decomposition and correction methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

*Arash Behboodi,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transductive conformal prediction shows a fundamental trade-off: higher confidence requires exponentially larger prediction sets, with size scaling with sample count and conditional entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent limitations and fundamental trade-offs in transductive conformal prediction methods, particularly the relationship between confidence levels and prediction set efficiency.

Method: Derived strict finite-sample bounds analyzing the exponential growth of prediction set size relative to confidence levels, incorporating conditional entropy and dispersion terms. Also examined a special case where all test points share the same label.

Result: Proved that non-trivial confidence levels lead to exponential growth in prediction set size, with exponent scaling linearly with sample count and proportional to conditional entropy. Provided achievable bounds and asymptotically optimal confidence predictors for special cases.

Conclusion: Transductive conformal prediction faces an unavoidable trade-off between confidence and efficiency, with prediction sets growing exponentially for meaningful confidence levels, fundamentally limiting practical applications with uncertainty.

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

*Jonas A. Actor,Anthony Gruber,Eric C. Cyr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention mechanisms in transformers are connected to multinomial regression, where optimizing latent features produces solutions that align with attention block dynamics, showing transformer representations evolve to recover optimal classification features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand internal components of ML models, but attention mechanisms remain poorly understood despite their central role in transformers. The relationship between attention and concepts like feature polysemanticity and superposition needs clarification.

Method: Establishes connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial regression. Shows that optimizing over latent features in fixed multinomial regression setting yields optimal solutions that align with attention block dynamics.

Result: The evolution of representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that recovers the optimal features for classification, providing mathematical underpinnings for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms in transformers are mathematically grounded in multinomial regression optimization, offering new interpretability insights into how transformer representations evolve toward optimal classification features.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

*Yuhan Helena Liu,Victor Geadah,Jonathan Pillow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible nonparametric framework using deep neural networks to infer biological learning rules from animal decision-making data during de novo task learning, capturing suboptimality, history dependence, and stimulus integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how animals learn new behaviors from scratch, which is challenging for existing approaches that assume specific parametric forms or are limited to simplified settings like bandit tasks.

Method: Proposed a nonparametric framework parameterizing per-trial policy weight updates with deep neural networks (DNN), validated in simulation, and extended to recurrent variants (RNN) to capture non-Markovian dynamics from trial history.

Result: Models improved predictions on held-out behavioral data from mice learning sensory decision-making tasks, revealing asymmetric updates after correct vs error trials and history dependence consistent with non-Markovian learning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible approach for inferring biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks, offering insights for experimental protocols and behavioral digital twins development.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies differentially private stochastic convex optimization under Tsybakov Noise Condition, providing novel algorithms with utility bounds independent of Lipschitz constant and matching lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DP-SCO studies assumed bounded Lipschitz constants, but many real-world problems have unbounded or extremely large Lipschitz constants. The paper aims to handle such challenging scenarios while maintaining differential privacy.

Method: Proposes (ε,δ)-DP algorithms for convex optimization under Tsybakov Noise Condition with bounded k-th moment gradients. Analyzes both Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz cases, and provides matching lower bounds for concentrated differential privacy.

Result: Achieves utility bounds independent of Lipschitz constant: Õ((r̃_{2k}(1/√n + √d/nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)}) for Lipschitz case, and improved bounds for small ε. Shows matching lower bounds Ω((r̃_k(1/√n + √d/n√ρ))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)}).

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses DP-SCO with potentially unbounded Lipschitz constants under Tsybakov Noise Condition, providing optimal algorithms with privacy guarantees and establishing fundamental limits through matching upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning models can detect flickering patterns (noise-driven switching between stable states) in complex systems, providing early warning signals for critical regime shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flickering is a key indicator of reduced resilience in climate, ecosystems, and financial systems, often preceding hard-to-predict critical regime shifts, but current detection methods are limited.

Method: Used convolutional LSTM (CNN LSTM) models trained on synthetic time series from simple polynomial functions with additive noise to identify flickering patterns.

Result: Models generalized well to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detected flickering in empirical datasets including dormouse body temperature records and African Humid Period palaeoclimate proxies.

Conclusion: Deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy nonlinear time series, offering a flexible framework for identifying instability across various dynamical systems.

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRAFT is a learning-based map conflation approach that uses knowledge graphs and geospatial feature encoding to merge geospatial databases, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing map conflation methods are limited to linear objects and use heuristic approaches, missing most entities and lacking data-driven learning capabilities.

Method: Three-part approach: (1) Knowledge Graph Construction representing GDBs as graphs, (2) Map Matching using knowledge graph alignment and geospatial feature encoding, (3) Map Merging with mixed integer linear programming for consistent merging.

Result: KRAFT achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with each module separately outperforming traditional matching and merging approaches.

Conclusion: KRAFT successfully addresses limitations of existing map conflation methods by providing a learning-based, comprehensive approach that handles both linear and non-linear objects through knowledge graph representation and optimization.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Motivation: To improve gesture classification using low-power biosignals (EMG) by aligning them with high-quality structured data (pose representations) for better representation quality and zero-shot capability.

Method: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework that learns an EMG encoder to produce pose-informative representations aligned with pose data.

Result: Outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on out-of-distribution (unseen) gesture classification.

Conclusion: Aligning weak-modality EMG data with structured pose representations enables high-quality gesture classification and effective zero-shot performance on unseen gestures.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

### [182] [Natural Spectral Fusion: p-Exponent Cyclic Scheduling and Early Decision-Boundary Alignment in First-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04713)
*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF) reframes optimization as controllable spectral coverage, using p-exponent cyclic scheduling to dynamically balance low- and high-frequency information without modifying models or training pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-order optimizers exhibit intrinsic frequency preferences that reshape optimization paths, but their spectral bias remains unclear and unexplored.

Method: Propose NSF with p-exponent extension of second-moment term (allowing positive/negative exponents) and cyclic scheduling to periodically reweight frequency bands at negligible cost.

Result: Adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, negative exponents amplify high frequencies. Cyclic scheduling broadens spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and achieves baseline accuracy with 1/4 training cost on some tasks.

Conclusion: NSF reveals optimizers as active spectral controllers and provides a unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization with consistent test error reduction across benchmarks.

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR is a model-free conformal prediction decoding strategy that ensures high coverage probability for desirable trajectories while maintaining compact search space, with theoretical guarantees of at least 1-α coverage rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decoding strategies like beam search lack provable coverage guarantees and struggle to balance efficiency with versatile trajectories, especially for long-tail sequences important in real-world applications.

Method: Proposes CoVeR, a novel model-free decoding strategy within the conformal prediction framework that maintains compact search space while ensuring high coverage probability.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes a PAC-style generalization bound guaranteeing CoVeR asymptotically achieves coverage rate of at least 1-α for any target level α ∈ (0,1).

Conclusion: CoVeR addresses limitations of traditional decoding methods by providing provable coverage guarantees while maintaining search efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring reliable trajectory coverage.

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con framework enables discovery of novel loss functions using alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels, achieving state-of-the-art results in unsupervised clustering, supervised contrastive learning, and dimensionality reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Information Contrastive framework showed many methods minimize KL divergence, but KL's asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges and misalignment with true objectives.

Method: Systematically explores alternative statistical divergences (like total variation distance and bounded f-divergences) and similarity kernels instead of KL divergence and angular kernels.

Result: Achieved SOTA in unsupervised clustering with TV distance, outperformed standard supervised contrastive learning with TV + distance kernel, and superior dimensionality reduction with bounded f-divergence vs SNE.

Conclusion: Divergence and similarity kernel choices significantly impact representation learning optimization, and alternatives to KL can yield better performance across various tasks.

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer combines cross-attention transformers with classical VARMA statistical modeling to improve time series forecasting by capturing both global dependencies and local temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based models like CATS remove self-attention for efficiency but overlook fine-grained local temporal dependencies that classical statistical models like VARMA effectively capture.

Method: Proposes VARMAformer with two innovations: 1) VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that models AR and MA patterns at patch level, and 2) VARMA-Enhanced Attention mechanism with temporal gate for context-aware queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show VARMAformer consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks provides significant benefits for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three novel node unlearning methods for GNNs that leverage graph topology to efficiently remove sensitive training nodes while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in GNNs by developing efficient methods to remove sensitive training data without compromising graph topology or requiring restrictive GNN structures.

Method: Proposed three methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering that utilize graph topological features for effective node unlearning.

Result: Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show superior performance in model utility, unlearning utility, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully protect sensitive node privacy in GNNs while maintaining efficiency, contributing to enhanced privacy and security in graph neural networks.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

TL;DR: ACED-DQN framework uses ensemble of diversified DQN agents with arbitration control to prevent catastrophic forgetting in continual RL, inspired by human prefrontal cortex decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in deep RL models when learning in continual reinforcement learning scenarios, inspired by how humans make decisions using multiple parallel RL agents in the prefrontal cortex.

Method: Integration of ensemble of diversified DQN variants with different value functions and arbitration control mechanism that prioritizes agents with higher reliability (less error) in recent trials.

Result: Significant performance improvements in both static and continual environments, with empirical evidence showing effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.

Conclusion: The ACED-DQN framework enables RL agents to continuously learn effectively by preventing catastrophic forgetting, drawing inspiration from human brain mechanisms.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time series forecasting is challenging due to chaotic properties. Existing foundation models need diverse training data, and synthetic chaotic time series generation can help create realistic financial data simulations.

Method: Generate artificial chaotic time series, apply resampling techniques to simulate financial data, conduct large-scale pre-training with 10B samples per case, and perform zero-shot prediction on Bitcoin trade data without retraining.

Result: Significant performance improvements over autocorrelation models in trading strategy profitability. Observed scaling law phenomenon where predictive performance improves with exponentially increasing training samples for extended horizons.

Conclusion: Large-scale training with synthetic chaotic data enables better financial forecasting. The observed scaling law suggests potential for near-future event prediction with substantial computational resources. Future work should verify this law across diverse chaotic models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

TL;DR: Embedding-based alignment process using Sentence-BERT to link German job titles to occupational ontologies through semantic similarity search, eliminating need for hand-crafted ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome computational expense and maintenance burden of hand-crafted ontologies for labor market analytics by leveraging language processing models to create scalable semantic bridges between occupational vocabularies.

Method: Fine-tune Sentence-BERT model on German Federal Employment Agency data to learn ontology structures, create similarity graph from job title embeddings, and use approximate nearest-neighbor search for classification as semantic search problem.

Result: Developed flexible framework that can link free-form German job titles to established occupational classifications (German Klassifikation der Berufe and ISCED) with greater flexibility for adding classes.

Conclusion: Machine learning approach provides scalable alternative to manual ontology curation, with ongoing work to extend to multiple ontologies and multilingual titles while addressing remaining challenges.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blinks in EEG are often treated as artifacts but contain valuable physiological information about cognitive load, attention, and neurological disorders. Accurate blink detection is crucial for monitoring these markers.

Method: Evaluated various deep learning architectures (RNNs, CNNs, TCNs, transformers, hybrids) on raw EEG signals with minimal pre-processing. Formulated as sequence-to-sequence task using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes from a public UCSD dataset of 31 subjects (15 healthy, 16 Parkinson's patients).

Result: CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently outperformed others, achieving 93.8%-95.8% accuracy in healthy cohort and 73.8%-75.8% in Parkinson's patients across different electrode configurations.

Conclusion: The CNN-RNN hybrid architecture is most effective for EEG blink detection, demonstrating robustness to tremor in Parkinson's patients and enabling accurate computation of blink rate statistics for physiological monitoring.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces bistochastic normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting to disentangle class similarity from distribution bias in confusion matrices, enabling better model diagnosis and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Confusion matrices mix class similarity and distribution bias effects, making it difficult to understand the true nature of classifier errors and identify targeted improvements.

Method: Bistochastic normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, which generalizes row and column normalization to recover underlying class similarity structure.

Result: The method successfully disentangles error sources, provides more accurate model diagnosis, and reveals correspondence between confusion matrix normalizations and internal class representations.

Conclusion: Bistochastic normalization offers deeper insights into classifier behavior by separating class similarity from distribution bias, supporting more targeted model improvements through geometric interpretation in representation space.

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA introduces spectral-inspired PINNs that overcome spectral bias and causality issues in standard PINNs by combining spectral basis projection with Neural ODEs for improved PDE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLP-based PINNs fail to converge on complex initial-value problems, violating causality and suffering from spectral bias towards low frequencies.

Method: NeuSA learns PDE projection onto spectral basis for finite-dimensional representation, integrated with adapted Neural ODE to enforce causality and leverage high-frequency components.

Result: Validated on linear/nonlinear wave equations, NeuSA shows faster convergence, improved temporal consistency, and superior predictive accuracy compared to other architectures.

Conclusion: NeuSA successfully addresses key limitations of PINNs through spectral representation and Neural ODE integration, enabling better PDE solution with causal structure and reduced spectral bias.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Motivation: Address routing policy optimization challenges in cloud server environments, particularly decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic topologies.

Method: Integrates Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module with multi-layer graph convolution and structural positional embeddings, plus Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism for adaptive structural updates based on policy behavior and rewards.

Result: Outperforms existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance metrics (throughput, latency control, link balance) on GEANT topology dataset, achieving efficient and robust routing.

Conclusion: Proposed topology-aware graph RL framework effectively handles dynamic cloud network routing with improved stability and decision quality through integrated structural modeling and adaptive updates.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

TL;DR: SAR and SAR^2 methods stabilize test-time adaptation by addressing batch norm instability and representation collapse through gradient-aware sample filtering, sharpness-aware optimization, and representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods fail in real-world scenarios with mixed distribution shifts, small batch sizes, and imbalanced label distributions, primarily due to batch norm instability and model collapse into trivial solutions.

Method: Proposed SAR method with sharpness-aware entropy minimization to filter noisy samples and find flat minima, and SAR^2 with additional redundancy and inequity regularizers to prevent representation collapse by reducing feature correlations and classification bias.

Result: The methods demonstrate stable performance and computational efficiency across challenging test scenarios including mixed distribution shifts, small batches, and imbalanced data, outperforming prior TTA approaches.

Conclusion: Addressing batch norm instability and representation collapse through gradient-aware filtering and representation regularization enables robust test-time adaptation in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

*Matouš Soldát,Jiří Kléma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel method combining Bayesian optimization with protein language model embeddings for machine-learning-assisted directed evolution, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with fewer screenings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed evolution is time-consuming and expensive due to iterative protein variant screening. Machine learning can help select more informative variants to reduce screening requirements while improving protein function.

Method: Combines Bayesian optimization with protein sequence embeddings from a pre-trained protein language model to select promising protein variants for screening.

Result: The new representation based on sequence embeddings significantly improves Bayesian optimization performance, yielding better results with the same number of screenings and outperforming state-of-the-art regression-based methods.

Conclusion: The integration of protein language model embeddings with Bayesian optimization provides an effective approach for machine-learning-assisted directed evolution, reducing screening costs while improving protein function outcomes.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

*Vijay Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel neural network initialization method that incorporates layer depth information and flexibly increases variance from first to last layer, outperforming existing schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing initialization methods either ignore depth information or don't properly handle variance propagation in deep networks, where maintaining unit variance throughout doesn't work well for very deep architectures.

Method: Proposed a flexible initialization scheme that incorporates both individual layer depth and total network depth information, allowing controlled variance increase from first to last layer activations.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method performs better than existing initialization schemes like Glorot, He, orthogonal matrix, and random walk methods.

Conclusion: Depth-aware initialization with flexible variance scaling is crucial for deep neural networks, and the proposed method provides superior performance compared to traditional initialization approaches.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate time-to-event prediction is crucial in oncology for treatment planning and patient management, requiring integration of heterogeneous patient data sources.

Method: DeepHit survival model with projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention to integrate clinical, MRI, RNA-seq, and whole-slide pathology features.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides promising pathway for personalized risk stratification in cancer and is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

*Tim Dernedde,Daniela Thyssens,Lars Schmidt-Thieme*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a recurrent encoder for neural combinatorial optimization that reuses computation from previous steps, achieving equivalent/better performance with fewer layers and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typical NCO construction methods make small state changes between steps, suggesting computation reuse could improve efficiency.

Method: Train a recurrent encoder that computes state embeddings based on current state and previous step's embeddings, enabling computation reuse.

Result: Recurrent encoder achieves equivalent or better performance with 3× fewer layers, significantly reducing latency on TSP, CVRP, and OP problems.

Conclusion: Recurrent encoders enable efficient computation reuse in NCO, improving latency while maintaining performance, with practical relevance demonstrated through integration with large neighborhood search.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

*Rafael Bischof,Michal Piovarči,Michael A. Kraus,Siddhartha Mishra,Bernd Bickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO is a multi-physics neural operator that achieves zero-shot generalization across parametric PDEs without task-specific fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods and enabling faster convergence when used for PINN initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a neural operator that can generalize across various parametric PDEs without requiring fine-tuning for each specific problem, addressing the limitations of current methods that need task-specific optimization.

Method: Combines Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork with mixed supervision using labeled data from analytical solutions (MMS) and unlabeled samples with physics-informed objectives. Includes iterative refinement procedure and ensemble approach to progressively reduce error.

Result: Achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven benchmark problems, outperforming U-Nets, Poseidon, and PINO. Iterative refinement achieves over 100x gain in average L2 loss. PINNs initialized by HyPINO converge faster and to lower error than random initialization and Reptile-meta-learned approaches.

Conclusion: HyPINO demonstrates scalable potential for solving complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost, serving as a foundation for extending neural operators.

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

### [202] [Should We Always Train Models on Fine-Grained Classes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05130)
*Davide Pirovano,Federico Milanesio,Michele Caselle,Piero Fariselli,Matteo Osella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-grained label training doesn't always improve classification accuracy - effectiveness depends on data geometry, label hierarchy relations, dataset size, and model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate when and why training with fine-grained hierarchical labels improves classification performance, as empirical evidence suggests benefits but without clear understanding of underlying conditions.

Method: Used both real and synthetic datasets to analyze the relationship between fine-grained label training and classification performance, examining data geometric structure, label hierarchy relations, dataset size, and model capacity factors.

Result: Fine-grained training does not universally improve accuracy; effectiveness depends critically on data geometric structure and its relation to label hierarchy, plus dataset size and model capacity.

Conclusion: The benefit of fine-grained label training is conditional and depends on specific data characteristics and experimental setup, rather than being a universally applicable strategy.

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

*Tosca Lechner,Alex Bie,Gautam Kamath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learnability under adaptive adversaries is strictly stronger than under oblivious adversaries, as adaptive adversaries can intercept and manipulate samples with full knowledge of learner's requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distribution class learnability differs when adversaries can adaptively intercept and manipulate samples versus only modifying the underlying distribution.

Method: Formulated a general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries considering adversary budget constraints, and compared it to learnability under oblivious adversaries.

Result: Showed that learnability with respect to additive adaptive adversaries is strictly stronger than learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Conclusion: Adaptive adversaries pose a more challenging threat model for distribution learning than oblivious adversaries, requiring stronger learnability conditions.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

TL;DR: Survey paper exploring the intersection of federated learning and foundational models, presenting a taxonomy and technical comparison of 42 methods, with healthcare as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for integrating privately owned data and expanding training resources for complex foundational models through federated learning, as no unified survey currently exists.

Method: Conducted literature review of over 4,200 articles, narrowed to 250+ thoroughly reviewed articles with 42 unique methods, structured around a novel taxonomy following development life-cycle stages.

Result: Created a comprehensive taxonomy and technical comparison of methods based on complexity, efficiency, and scalability, providing practical insights for implementation.

Conclusion: Provides a self-contained overview of the field with practical guidelines for adopting and integrating foundational models with federated learning, particularly highlighting healthcare applications.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

*Dmitry Akulov,Mohamed Sana,Antonio De Domenico,Tareq Si Salem,Nicola Piovesan,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel KV cache compression method using attention-guided composite tokens that reduces memory usage while maintaining accuracy and compatibility with standard inference engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, creating a major bottleneck for long-context inference in LLMs. Existing compression methods either use rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized kernels.

Method: Attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens that aggregate attention scores to estimate token importance, select head-specific tokens independently, and align them into composite tokens while respecting uniform cache structure. Includes global allocation mechanism to adapt retention budgets across layers.

Result: Achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment that remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

TL;DR: Lightweight 1D CNN with structured pruning achieves efficient EEG seizure detection with 92.87% accuracy and improved F1 score while reducing model size by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of deep learning models for EEG-based seizure detection in resource-limited environments where real-time detection and computational efficiency are critical.

Method: Developed a lightweight one-dimensional CNN with structured pruning (removing 50% of convolutional kernels based on importance) and mild early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieved 92.78% accuracy and 0.8686 macro-F1 score baseline; after pruning, maintained predictive capabilities with 92.87% accuracy and improved macro-F1 score to 0.8707 while reducing weights and memory by 50%.

Conclusion: Structured pruning effectively removes redundancy, improves generalization, and combined with mild early stopping provides an efficient and reliable approach for seizure detection in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

### [207] [Shift Before You Learn: Enabling Low-Rank Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05193)
*Bastien Dubail,Stefan Stojanovic,Alexandre Proutière*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common low-rank assumption in RL by showing that the successor measure itself is not low-rank, but a shifted version (bypassing initial transitions) naturally exhibits low-rank structure. The authors provide finite-sample guarantees for estimating this low-rank approximation and connect the required shift to Markov chain mixing properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many modern RL algorithms assume low-rank structure in successor measures, but this assumption may not hold. The authors aim to identify where low-rank structure actually emerges and provide theoretical foundations for more effective low-rank approximations in RL.

Method: The authors analyze the shifted successor measure (bypassing initial transitions), provide finite-sample performance guarantees for low-rank approximation estimation, derive Type II Poincaré inequalities for Markov chains, and connect shift requirements to spectral recoverability and local mixing properties.

Result: The paper shows that low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure rather than the original one. Both approximation and estimation errors are governed by spectral recoverability, and the required shift depends on high-order singular value decay and local mixing properties, typically being small in practice.

Conclusion: Shifting the successor measure enables effective low-rank approximation and estimation in RL. This approach leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL, as validated by experiments, and provides theoretical insights connecting shift requirements to Markov chain properties.

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Conclusion: RapidGNN effectively addresses communication bottlenecks in distributed GNN training through deterministic scheduling and caching strategies, demonstrating significant performance improvements and scalability across various graph datasets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient

cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing

mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop data-driven deep learning approaches for real-time monitoring and optimization of amine-based carbon capture systems, addressing the need for predictive tools that can handle both steady-state and dynamic operational conditions while reducing environmental impacts.

Method: Used operational data from CESAR1 solvent campaign to develop four DL architectures (Basic LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, Convolutional LSTM) for predicting amine emissions and system performance parameters. Conducted causal impact analysis by perturbing 8 input variables by ±20% to assess operational impacts.

prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

### [211] [A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Interpretable Cyberattack Detection in AGC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05259)
*Jehad Jilan,Niranjana Naveen Nambiar,Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Alok Paranjape,Amr Youssef,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for detecting False Data Injection Attacks in Automatic Generation Control systems, achieving ~96% detection rates with low false alarms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AGC systems are vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks like FDIAs that evade conventional detection methods, requiring more interpretable and accurate detection approaches.

Method: Uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) that can extract symbolic equations, trained offline to learn nonlinear relationships between AGC measurements under various operating scenarios.

Result: Achieves FDIA detection rates of 95.97% for the initial model and 95.9% for the symbolic formula, both with low false alarm rates.

Conclusion: KAN provides an interpretable and reliable approach for enhancing AGC cybersecurity against stealthy cyberattacks, offering both high accuracy and transparency through symbolic formula extraction.

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

*Jason Gardner,Ayan Dutta,Swapnoneel Roy,O. Patrick Kreidl,Ladislau Boloni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic benchmarking of 7 DRL algorithms shows significant variations in energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and monetary costs, with some algorithms achieving comparable performance while using up to 24% less energy and 68% lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning raise environmental and economic concerns, but energy requirements and costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored despite extensive study of learning performance efficiency.

Method: Benchmarked 7 state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN, TRPO, A2C, ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, QR-DQN) using Stable Baselines, trained each for one million steps on ten Atari 2600 games, with real-time power measurement to estimate energy usage, CO2 emissions, and electricity costs.

Result: Substantial variation in energy efficiency and training costs across algorithms - ARS consumed 24% less energy than DQN, QR-DQN emitted nearly 68% less CO2 and incurred almost 68% lower monetary cost than RecurrentPPO, while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: Algorithmic choices can mitigate environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance, providing actionable insights for energy-aware and cost-efficient DRL practices and establishing foundation for sustainability considerations in future algorithmic design.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: SpikingBrain introduces brain-inspired models with linear/hybrid-linear attention and spiking neurons for efficient long-context training and inference on non-NVIDIA platforms, achieving comparable performance to Transformers with 150B tokens and significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address quadratic computation scaling and linear memory growth in Transformer-based LLMs, enabling efficient long-context processing and stable training on non-NVIDIA hardware platforms.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Linear/hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons, (2) Efficient conversion-based training pipeline and spike coding framework, (3) Customized training frameworks and operator libraries optimized for MetaX GPU cluster.

Result: Developed SpikingBrain-7B (linear) and SpikingBrain-76B (hybrid-linear MoE) models that achieve comparable performance to open-source Transformers using only 150B tokens. Achieved 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences, 23.4% Model FLOPs Utilization, 69.15% sparsity for low-power operation, and stable training on hundreds of MetaX GPUs.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired mechanisms with spiking neurons and linear attention architectures enable efficient, scalable large model design with significant improvements in training efficiency and inference memory usage, demonstrating viability of non-NVIDIA platform development.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Motivation: Addressing the growing challenge of deepfakes and digital image forgeries by ensuring image authenticity through improved detection methods.

Method: Proposes a dual-branch convolutional neural network that extracts features from both spatial and frequency domains, fuses them, and uses a Siamese network to generate 64-dimensional embeddings for classification.

Result: Achieves 77.9% accuracy on CASIA 2.0 dataset, outperforming traditional statistical methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and balanced approach for digital image forensic scrutiny, advancing visual forensics for media verification, law enforcement, and content reliability applications.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper connects distributed ADMM with graph neural networks, learning adaptive hyperparameters through GNNs to improve convergence speed and solution quality while preserving convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM is popular for distributed optimization but suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by leveraging the connection between ADMM and graph neural networks.

Method: Represent distributed ADMM iterations within GNN message-passing framework, learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights using a GNN that predicts hyperparameters based on iterates. Train network end-to-end by unrolling ADMM for fixed iterations.

Result: Numerical experiments show the learned variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared to standard ADMM.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines ADMM with GNNs to learn adaptive hyperparameters, achieving better performance while maintaining convergence properties.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DRL-PUT, a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for personalized utility tuning in ad recommender systems that outperforms manual tuning with 9.7% CTR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual tuning of ranking utility functions in ad recommender systems is suboptimal due to unprincipled objectives, vast parameter space, lack of personalization, and inability to adapt to seasonality.

Method: Formulates utility tuning as a reinforcement learning task where optimal hyperparameters are predicted for each ad request state to maximize predefined reward. Learns policy model directly from online serving logs without value function estimation.

Result: Online A/B testing showed DRL-PUT improved click-through rate by 9.7% and long click-through rate by 7.7% compared to manual tuning baseline on treated segment.

Conclusion: DRL-PUT framework effectively addresses multi-objective optimization challenges in ad recommender systems through personalized, data-driven utility tuning that adapts to different contexts and outperforms traditional manual approaches.

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

### [217] [The Paradox of Doom: Acknowledging Extinction Risk Reduces the Incentive to Prevent It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04855)
*Jakub Growiec,Klaus Prettner*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: Human extinction risk increases impatience and reduces incentives to invest in mitigation efforts, while individual mortality risk can be hedged through reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humanity consistently underinvests in catastrophic risk mitigation by examining how extinction risk affects time preferences and discount rates.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework distinguishing human extinction risk from individual mortality risk, incorporating intergenerational altruism and the "selfish gene" evolutionary perspective.

Result: Extinction risk is an indispensable component of discount rates that increases impatience, while individual mortality risk can be partially or fully hedged through reproduction. Greater extinction threats lead to less investment in mitigation.

Conclusion: The framework explains humanity's persistent underinvestment in catastrophic risk mitigation (climate change, pandemics, AI risks) by showing extinction risk makes people more impatient rather than farsighted.

Abstract: We investigate the salience of extinction risk as a source of impatience. Our
framework distinguishes between human extinction risk and individual mortality
risk while allowing for various degrees of intergenerational altruism.
Additionally, we consider the evolutionarily motivated "selfish gene"
perspective. We find that the risk of human extinction is an indispensable
component of the discount rate, whereas individual mortality risk can be hedged
against - partially or fully, depending on the setup - through human
reproduction. Overall, we show that in the face of extinction risk, people
become more impatient rather than more farsighted. Thus, the greater the threat
of extinction, the less incentive there is to invest in avoiding it. Our
framework can help explain why humanity consistently underinvests in mitigation
of catastrophic risks, ranging from climate change mitigation, via pandemic
prevention, to addressing the emerging risks of transformative artificial
intelligence.

*Danielle Ensign,Henry Sleight,Kyle Fish*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs choose to bail out of conversations 0.28-32% of the time when given bail options, but real-world rates may be lower (0.06-7%) after accounting for false positives and model dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs will voluntarily exit conversations when given the option, and understand the factors influencing bail behavior.

Method: Used three bail methods (bail tool, bail string, bail prompt) on continuations of real-world data (Wildchat and ShareGPT), created BailBench synthetic dataset, and analyzed relationships between refusals and bails.

Result: Models bail 0.28-32% of the time depending on method and model, but real rates may be 4x lower. Bail rates vary significantly between models and methods. Jailbreaks decrease refusals but increase bails.

Conclusion: LLMs do exhibit bail behavior, with rates influenced by model choice, bail method, and prompt wording. Bail behavior is distinct from refusal behavior and occurs across most tested models.

Abstract: When given the option, will LLMs choose to leave the conversation (bail)? We
investigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of
interactions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can
call, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model
if it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and
ShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around
0.28-32\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we
find that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript,
which means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we
also take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\%), we estimate real
world bail rates range from 0.06-7\%, depending on the model and bail method.
We use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a
non-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct
BailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models
bail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior
occurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail
methods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between
refusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\% of continuations of real world
conversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks
tend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration
increases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate
on BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate.

TL;DR: ISA-DRE is a novel density ratio estimation framework that uses global secant functions instead of infinitesimal tangents, achieving accurate any-step estimation without numerical integration through interval annealing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing density ratio estimation methods often sacrifice accuracy for efficiency, creating a need for a method that can provide both accurate and efficient estimation suitable for neural approximation.

Method: ISA-DRE learns a global secant function (expectation of all tangents over an interval) with lower variance, uses Secant Alignment Identity for self-consistency, and employs Contraction Interval Annealing to gradually expand alignment intervals for training stability.

Result: Empirically achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer function evaluations compared to prior methods, enabling much faster inference.

Conclusion: ISA-DRE provides an efficient and accurate density ratio estimation framework well-suited for real-time and interactive applications, overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but
existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose
\textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)},
a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical
integration.
  Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE
learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents
over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for
neural approximation. This is made possible by the \emph{Secant Alignment
Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with
its underlying tangent representations.
  To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \emph{Contraction
Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment
interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which
improves convergence and training stability.
  Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer
function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster
inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Novel differential privacy mechanism for variance/covariance estimation using Bézier curves, achieving minimax optimality in add-remove model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy research focuses on swap model, but add-remove model is less explored and more challenging due to private dataset size requirement.

Method: Developed Bézier mechanism - a moment-release framework using Bernstein bases for efficient variance and covariance estimation under differential privacy.

Result: Proved mechanisms are minimax optimal in high-privacy regime, established new lower bounds, and showed superior instance-wise utility compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Bézier mechanism is effective for statistical tasks beyond variance/covariance estimation, providing optimal privacy-preserving estimation in challenging add-remove model.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the variance and covariance
of datasets under differential privacy in the add-remove model. While
estimation in the swap model has been extensively studied in the literature,
the add-remove model remains less explored and more challenging, as the dataset
size must also be kept private. To address this issue, we develop efficient
mechanisms for variance and covariance estimation based on the \emph{B\'{e}zier
mechanism}, a novel moment-release framework that leverages Bernstein bases. We
prove that our proposed mechanisms are minimax optimal in the high-privacy
regime by establishing new minimax lower bounds. Moreover, beyond worst-case
scenarios, we analyze instance-wise utility and show that the B\'{e}zier-based
estimator consistently achieves better utility compared to alternative
mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the B\'{e}zier
mechanism beyond variance and covariance estimation, showcasing its
applicability to other statistical tasks.

TL;DR: Analysis of spectral algorithms under covariate shift with importance weighting, covering both well-specified and misspecified cases in RKHS, with minimax-optimal convergence rates and novel truncation techniques for unbounded weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distributional mismatch in covariate shift settings where input marginal distributions differ between source and target domains but conditional distributions remain unchanged, extending kernel learning theory to more practical scenarios.

Method: Incorporates importance weights (target/source density ratios) into spectral algorithms within RKHS nonparametric regression. Uses novel truncation technique for unbounded weights and provides theoretical analysis for misspecified cases where target function doesn't belong to RKHS.

Result: Establishes minimax-optimal convergence rates for well-specified cases with bounded density ratios. Achieves near-optimal convergence rates for unbounded weights through truncation under mild regularity conditions, extending results to misspecified regime.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive framework for understanding interaction between covariate shift and model misspecification, extending classical kernel learning theory to practical scenarios with distributional mismatch and unbounded importance weights.

Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of spectral algorithms --
a class of regularization methods originating from inverse problems -- under
covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal distributions of inputs differ
between source and target domains, while the conditional distribution of
outputs given inputs remains unchanged. To address this distributional
mismatch, we incorporate importance weights, defined as the ratio of target to
source densities, into the learning framework. This leads to a weighted
spectral algorithm within a nonparametric regression setting in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). More importantly, in contrast to prior work that
largely focuses on the well-specified setting, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of the more challenging misspecified case, in which the
target function does not belong to the RKHS. Under the assumption of uniformly
bounded density ratios, we establish minimax-optimal convergence rates when the
target function lies within the RKHS. For scenarios involving unbounded
importance weights, we introduce a novel truncation technique that attains
near-optimal convergence rates under mild regularity conditions, and we further
extend these results to the misspecified regime. By addressing the intertwined
challenges of covariate shift and model misspecification, this work extends
classical kernel learning theory to more practical scenarios, providing a
systematic framework for understanding their interaction.

TL;DR: ICON is an operator learning method that maps example condition-solution pairs to approximate solution operators. This paper reveals ICON implicitly performs Bayesian inference and extends it to a generative framework (GenICON) for uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a probabilistic interpretation of in-context operator networks (ICON) and extend them to generative settings for principled uncertainty quantification in operator learning.

Method: Develops a probabilistic framework showing ICON computes the mean of posterior predictive distribution over solution operators. Extends ICON to GenICON for sampling from this distribution using random differential equations formalism.

Result: ICON is revealed to perform Bayesian inference implicitly. The generative formulation GenICON enables capturing uncertainty in solution operators and provides principled uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The probabilistic perspective provides theoretical foundation for ICON and enables generative extensions for uncertainty-aware operator learning, with applications to differential equation solving.

Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods
based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set
of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding
solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON
learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation
to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic
framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where
it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution
operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution
pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the
probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also
providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This
probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to
\emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive
distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON
(GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which
enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in
operator learning.

### [223] [Labelling Data with Unknown References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03083)
*Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: A method to verify evaluator trustworthiness without labeled references by posing successive challenges and checking consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When labeled reference data is unavailable, traditional methods for establishing evaluator trustworthiness (testing or assuming knowledge) don't work. There's a need for a way to verify evaluators without existing labeled data.

Method: The No-Data Algorithm poses successive challenges to the evaluator to establish trustworthiness. It works by checking if the evaluator can consistently prove its labeling capability through these challenges without requiring pre-labeled reference data.

Result: The algorithm can establish trustworthiness with high probability - it accepts evaluators that actually know how to label the corpus and flags untrustworthy ones that cannot prove their capability. Formal proofs of correctness and empirical tests support the approach.

Conclusion: The No-Data Algorithm provides a practical solution for establishing evaluator trustworthiness in scenarios where labeled reference data is unavailable, with applications including LLM-as-judge evaluations for low-resource languages.

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to
LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.

Motivation: f-divergence is fundamental for measuring distribution differences, and understanding how to efficiently approximate it between complex probabilistic models like Ising models has important applications in statistics and machine learning.

Method: The authors develop approximation algorithms that work within specific parameter regimes, extending their approach to multiple f-divergence types including χ^α-divergence, α-divergence, KL divergence, Rényi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance.

Result: They establish both algorithmic results and matching hardness results, showing their algorithms work in parameter regimes that align with the computational complexity lower bounds.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive framework for approximating various f-divergences between Ising models with arbitrary relative error guarantees, bridging theoretical hardness results with practical algorithmic solutions.

Abstract: The $f$-divergence is a fundamental notion that measures the difference
between two distributions. In this paper, we study the problem of approximating
the $f$-divergence between two Ising models, which is a generalization of
recent work on approximating the TV-distance. Given two Ising models $\nu$ and
$\mu$, which are specified by their interaction matrices and external fields,
the problem is to approximate the $f$-divergence $D_f(\nu\,\|\,\mu)$ within an
arbitrary relative error $\mathrm{e}^{\pm \varepsilon}$. For
$\chi^\alpha$-divergence with a constant integer $\alpha$, we establish both
algorithmic and hardness results. The algorithm works in a parameter regime
that matches the hardness result. Our algorithm can be extended to other
$f$-divergences such as $\alpha$-divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence,
R\'enyi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Using LLMs to generate synthetic code review training data by translating changes from well-resourced languages to underrepresented languages, enabling effective review classification in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of insufficient labelled data for training code review classifiers in new programming languages and frameworks, despite abundant unlabelled code availability.

Method: Leverage LLMs to translate code changes from resource-rich languages to equivalent changes in underrepresented languages, generating synthetic training data to train supervised classifiers for review recommendation.

Result: Experiments across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs show LLM-generated synthetic data effectively bootstraps review systems, narrowing performance gap with models trained on real labelled data.

Conclusion: Provides scalable pathway to extend automated code review capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks without requiring annotated data, overcoming the labelled data scarcity problem.

Abstract: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is
vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows.
However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a
critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily
available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised
models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages
into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating
synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that
although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from
available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are
considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To
overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train
supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of
these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments
across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that
LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation
systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This
approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review
capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of
annotated data.

*Keqin Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AI-driven compression techniques for wireless fronthaul links, focusing on CSI feedback with end-to-end learning and RB-level precoding optimization to achieve high compression with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compression methods like compressed sensing and scalar quantization are inadequate for modern fronthaul requirements due to restrictive priors, poor high-compression performance, and lack of adaptability across different channels and deployments.

Method: Survey of AI-driven compression techniques followed by focused analysis of two approaches: 1) CSI feedback with end-to-end learning, and 2) Resource Block granularity precoding optimization combined with compression. Proposes a cell-free architecture tailored fronthaul compression strategy.

Result: The proposed strategy achieves high compression ratios with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized cooperative transmission.

Conclusion: AI-driven compression techniques significantly outperform traditional methods for fronthaul links, enabling efficient transport of high-dimensional signals under strict bandwidth and latency constraints in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional
signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes
compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing,
scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive
priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across
channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization,
and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State
Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first
surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis
of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end
learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined
with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul
compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets
high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate
adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized
cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.

*Chengyandan Shen,Christoffer Sloth*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRLR framework combines deep reinforcement learning with demonstrations to improve exploration efficiency in robotics tasks by mitigating bootstrapping errors and preventing sub-optimal convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient exploration and bootstrapping errors in deep reinforcement learning for robotics tasks that require extensive environment interactions.

Method: Modified IBRL algorithm with calibrated Q-value action selection module and uses SAC instead of TD3 as RL policy to prevent sub-optimal convergence.

Result: Effective mitigation of bootstrapping error and overfitting, demonstrated robustness across tasks with varying state-action dimensions and demonstration qualities, successful sim2real deployment on wheel loader.

Conclusion: DRLR framework provides an exploration-efficient solution for robotics tasks that successfully bridges simulation to real-world deployment while handling varying demonstration quality.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

TL;DR: ICPAD framework enables rapid adaptation of diffusion-based skill learning policies across domains with no model updates and limited target data, using cross-domain skill diffusion and dynamic domain prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting reinforcement learning policies to diverse target domains under strict constraints of no model updates and limited target domain data availability.

Method: Uses cross-domain skill diffusion scheme with domain-agnostic prototype skills and domain-grounded skill adapter learned from offline data through consistent diffusion processes, plus dynamic domain prompting for better target domain alignment.

Result: Superior policy adaptation performance demonstrated in robotic manipulation (Metaworld) and autonomous driving (CARLA) under limited target data conditions across various cross-domain configurations.

Conclusion: The ICPAD framework effectively bridges different domains through diffusion-based skill learning and enables rapid policy adaptation without model updates, making it suitable for long-horizon multi-task environments with domain differences.

Abstract: In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework
designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Motivation: Robots need reliable topological localization to perform tasks, but visual localization faces challenges from perceptual ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. The research addresses this using only perspective camera images without relying on temporal image sequences.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art visual descriptors including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches. Conducted systematic comparison of features, distance measures, and classifiers using standard evaluation metrics and visualizations.

Result: Results demonstrate advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity measures, and classifiers. The system successfully identified locations of novel image sequences in the Robot Vision task of ImageCLEF evaluation campaign.

Conclusion: Properly configured visual descriptors enable effective topological localization. Future work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature combinations to build more robust real-time localization systems across varied illumination conditions.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deictic gestures like pointing are fundamental for non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction, enabling robots to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate responses during collaboration.

Method: Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF) architecture using inter-modality attention to map 2D pointing gestures to object locations, assign likelihood scores, and identify the most likely target in tabletop scenarios with the NICOL robot.

Result: The method can accurately predict intended objects using monocular RGB data, enabling intuitive human-robot collaboration. Performance was evaluated using a novel patch confusion matrix that provides insights into model predictions across candidate object locations.

Conclusion: MM-ITF provides an effective solution for interpreting pointing gestures in HRI, making human-robot collaboration more accessible and intuitive through vision-based gesture understanding.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

TL;DR: Robust MPC framework for non-Gaussian perception noise using set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes, reformulated as LP for efficiency, validated on mobile robot with stable performance under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address non-Gaussian noise in deep learning-based perception modules for state estimation, moving beyond conventional zero-mean noise assumptions to ensure safe feedback control through accurate uncertainty quantification.

Method: Set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased, heavy-tailed uncertainties; reformulate robust MPC as linear program using Minkowski-Lyapunov cost function; ensure stability through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic invariant sets; derive largest stabilizing terminal set via ellipsoidal approximation.

Result: Framework validated through simulations and hardware experiments on omnidirectional mobile robot with camera and CNN perception module in ROS2. Demonstrates stable and accurate control under heavy-tailed noise, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Conclusion: The perception-aware MPC framework effectively handles non-Gaussian perception noise, providing robust control performance and superior error bounding compared to conventional Gaussian-based approaches, making it suitable for real-world robotic applications with deep learning perception modules.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment

with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Diffusion with expert routing establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving, demonstrating superior performance and modular knowledge composition capabilities.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate

experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RL-ViGen benchmark with Franka Emika robot, showing better generalization, sample efficiency, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: DeGuV effectively enhances RL generalization and efficiency while improving interpretability through visual attention highlighting, making it suitable for real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from

learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive

Result: Validated on synthetic and empirical data, particularly in studying scientific collaboration patterns. The approach identifies non-monotonic patterns that linear models cannot detect.

Conclusion: The proposed flexible RHEM provides deeper insights into dynamic factors driving relational hyper-events by capturing complex time-varying non-linear relationships.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have made it easier to collect large and
complex networks of time-stamped relational events connecting two or more
entities. Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of
these events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on
past history and external information.
  However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches
still rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work,
we address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the
effects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying
and non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take
this further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor
product smooths.
  We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In
particular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and
impact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic
factors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential
non-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.

### [240] [An Interactive Tool for Analyzing High-Dimensional Clusterings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04603)
*Justin Lin,Julia Fukuyama*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Interactive tool for diagnosing nonlinear dimension reduction results to identify false structures in high-dimensional data visualization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of false structures created by nonlinear dimension reduction methods, especially in noisy high-dimensional data settings where space manipulation can produce misleading visual interpretations

Method: Developed an interactive tool (DRtool R package) that uses various analytical plots to provide multi-faceted perspectives on dimension reduction results, helping analysts determine the legitimacy of visualized structures

Result: Created a practical tool that enables better understanding and diagnosis of dimension reduction outcomes, helping distinguish genuine patterns from artifacts of the reduction process

Conclusion: The DRtool package provides analysts with diagnostic capabilities to validate dimension reduction results, addressing a critical need for reliability assessment in nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques for high-dimensional data analysis

Abstract: Technological advances have spurred an increase in data complexity and
dimensionality. We are now in an era in which data sets containing thousands of
features are commonplace. To digest and analyze such high-dimensional data,
dimension reduction techniques have been developed and advanced along with
computational power. Of these techniques, nonlinear methods are most commonly
employed because of their ability to construct visually interpretable
embeddings. Unlike linear methods, these methods non-uniformly stretch and
shrink space to create a visual impression of the high-dimensional data. Since
capturing high-dimensional structures in a significantly lower number of
dimensions requires drastic manipulation of space, nonlinear dimension
reduction methods are known to occasionally produce false structures,
especially in noisy settings. In an effort to deal with this phenomenon, we
developed an interactive tool that enables analysts to better understand and
diagnose their dimension reduction results. It uses various analytical plots to
provide a multi-faceted perspective on results to determine legitimacy. The
tool is available via an R package named DRtool.

*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Novel APT detection framework combining AutoEncoders with active learning to improve detection accuracy with minimal labeled data, tested on real-world imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised learning requires large labeled datasets which are scarce for APT detection, especially given the stealthy nature and rarity of APT attacks in real data.

Method: Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework with active learning loop that selectively queries labels for uncertain samples to iteratively improve detection.

Result: Substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning, outperforming existing methods on real-world imbalanced datasets with APT-like attacks accounting for only 0.004% of data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces labeling costs while improving APT detection accuracy, enabling effective learning with minimal data and reducing reliance on extensive manual labeling.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present a considerable challenge to
cybersecurity due to their stealthy, long-duration nature. Traditional
supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data,
which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning
to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for
labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs
while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn
with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present
a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based
anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop
progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on
real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent
Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data.
The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux,
BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show
substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning,
outperforming existing methods.

*Zijian Wang,Wei Tong,Tingxuan Han,Haoyu Chen,Tianling Zhang,Yunlong Mao,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Novel model poisoning attack framework for LDP-based federated learning that maximizes global training loss while evading robust aggregation defenses through adaptive reverse training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning with local differential privacy lacks sufficient robustness against malicious participants, particularly model poisoning attacks that disrupt global model convergence.

Method: Developed adaptive attacks that embed carefully crafted constraints into a reverse training process to evade robust aggregation mechanisms like Multi-Krum and trimmed mean.

Result: Experimental evaluation across three LDPFL protocols, three datasets, and two DNN types shows significant performance degradation of global models, with effectiveness influenced by data heterogeneity and privacy budgets.

Conclusion: Reveals critical vulnerabilities in LDPFL protocols and highlights the urgent need for more robust defense strategies against model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP)
enables privacy-preserving model training across decentralized data sources.
However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to
participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols,
particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject
malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently
studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning
attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the
objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local
privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as
Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully
crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these
defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL
protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy
budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model,
revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust
LDPFL defense strategies against MPA. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital social media platforms often lead to cognitive-behavioral fixation where users engage repetitively with narrow content, but computational methods for detecting this phenomenon remain underexplored.

Method: Proposed framework includes multimodal topic extraction and cognitive-behavioral fixation quantification modules that enable adaptive, hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior patterns.

Result: Experiments on existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The framework lays groundwork for scalable computational analysis of cognitive fixation, with all code publicly available for research purposes.

Abstract: Digital social media platforms frequently contribute to cognitive-behavioral
fixation, a phenomenon in which users exhibit sustained and repetitive
engagement with narrow content domains. While cognitive-behavioral fixation has
been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting
and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by
analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral
fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive,
hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on
existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational
analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on divergence detection was limited to small benchmarks (tens to hundreds of lines of code), making them impractical for real-world codebases that can contain tens or hundreds of millions of lines of code.

Method: The tool uses proof techniques with compositional and under-approximate approaches - compositionality supports scalability, while under-approximation ensures soundness for proving divergence.

Result: Applied to over 100 million lines of open-source and proprietary C, C++, and Hack code, identifying over 30 previously unknown divergence issues.

Conclusion: Pulse Infinite establishes a new state of the art for detecting divergence in real-world codebases, demonstrating practical applicability at massive scale.

Abstract: We report on our tool, Pulse Infinite, that uses proof techniques to show
non-termination (divergence) in large programs. Pulse Infinite works
compositionally and under-approximately: the former supports scale, and the
latter ensures soundness for proving divergence. Prior work focused on small
benchmarks in the tens or hundreds of lines of code (LoC), and scale limits
their practicality: a single company may have tens of millions, or even

*Ryosuke Takata,Atsushi Masumori,Takashi Ikegammi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: LLM agents in an El Farol Bar problem showed emergent social dynamics, balancing game-theoretic rationality with human-like social motivations, creating a new model of collective decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM agents navigate social dilemmas and whether they exhibit human-like social behaviors in classic game theory problems like the El Farol Bar problem.

Method: Used LLM agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem setup, observing their autonomous decision-making processes and social interactions under prompt-specified constraints (60% threshold).

Result: LLM agents developed spontaneous motivation to attend the bar, formed collective decision-making patterns, and balanced external constraints with internal social preferences, behaving more like humans than perfectly rational agents.

Conclusion: LLM agents can naturally integrate formal rationality with social motivations, enabling new models of group decision-making that weren't possible in traditional game-theoretic frameworks.

Abstract: We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM)
agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they
autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents
generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision
making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not
solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These
findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives
(prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal
incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training),
demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic
rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These
findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be
handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM
agents.

Main category: cs.MA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited resources of individual network devices hinder efficient operation of LLM-enabled agents with complex tool calls, creating an urgent need for efficient multi-level device collaborations in 6G networks.

Method: Proposes a dual-loop framework: outer loop for global agent and sub-agents collaboration with task decomposition and parallel distribution; inner loop for sub-agents to circularly reason, execute, and replan sub-tasks with parallel tool calling and offloading strategies.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved task planning capability and task execution efficiency, validated through a case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-loop terminal-edge collaboration framework addresses resource limitations and enables efficient LLM-enabled agent operations in 6G networks, though open challenges remain that need further research to accelerate the 6G era.

Abstract: The ubiquitous computing resources in 6G networks provide ideal environments
for the fusion of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent services through
the agent framework. With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled
agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment
semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual
network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled
agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient
multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the
LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are
proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative
collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on
edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through
task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop
utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and
replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading
strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning
capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted
case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open
challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks,
accelerating the advent of the 6G era.

TL;DR: Memristor-based neural networks achieve competitive performance for space applications through bit-slicing, temporal averaging, and periodic activation functions, reducing error rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space applications require reliable AI accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness, but memristive devices suffer from non-idealities that degrade neural network performance.

Method: Used bit-slicing, temporal averaging of neural network layers, and periodic activation functions to mitigate memristor non-idealities in simulations.

Result: Improved performance from 0.07 to 0.01 and 0.3 to 0.007 error rates for navigation/control and geodesy tasks, approaching state-of-the-art levels (0.003-0.005 and 0.003).

Conclusion: Memristors show strong potential for space applications, and future technology improvements could further close the performance gap to fully unlock their benefits.

Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence
(AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness --
properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft.
However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while
memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability,
conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to
memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation.
In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve
competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control
and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers,
and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around
$0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming
close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our
results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space
applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements
will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of
memristors.

*Han Liang,Jiahui Zhou,Zicheng Zhou,Xiaoxi Zhang,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: STADI is a novel framework that accelerates diffusion model inference in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments through spatio-temporal adaptive parallelism, reducing latency by up to 45% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion parallelism schemes underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments where varying hardware capabilities cause workload imbalance, leading to inefficient inference.

Method: Hybrid scheduler with computation-aware step allocator using LCM-minimizing quantization for temporal parallelism, and elastic patch parallelism mechanism for spatial workload distribution based on GPU capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show STADI improves load balancing, mitigates performance bottlenecks, reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45%, and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.

Conclusion: STADI effectively addresses workload imbalance in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments through adaptive spatio-temporal parallelism, achieving substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art diffusion inference frameworks.

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image
generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their
substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism
inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU
environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause
workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion
Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in
such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained
parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI
introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup
phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to
reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further
minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism
mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to
their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through
a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both
load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,
demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance
bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion
inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference
latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on
heterogeneous GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is extremely computationally expensive but public information about scaling performance and training considerations is scarce, making practical recommendations needed.

Method: The paper focuses on distributed training approaches, managing massive datasets across hundreds of nodes, and scaling data parallelism to fully leverage available GPU compute capacity.

Result: The paper provides insights and practical recommendations for optimizing large-scale LLM training pipelines that are not readily available in current public literature.

Conclusion: By addressing the scarcity of public information on large-scale LLM training, this work helps demystify the complex process of scaling up language model pretraining with efficient distributed computing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show best-in-class performance across a wide
range of natural language processing applications. Training these models is an
extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing
infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive
datasets. Unfortunately, information about the scaling performance and training
considerations of these large training pipelines is scarce in public
literature. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and
practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning
training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we
aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in
particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across
hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully
leveraging available GPU compute capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between narrative text generation and playable visual environments in procedural content generation, enabling story-driven scene creation.

Method: Extracts key time frames from LLM-generated narratives, identifies Object-Relation-Object triples, uses GameTileNet embeddings for asset retrieval, generates terrain with Cellular Automata, and places objects using spatial rules.

Result: Evaluated on ten diverse stories with successful tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable approach for narrative-driven scene generation and establishes foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity and story-centered PCG.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story
generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments
remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a
lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of
2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given
an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames,
extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples,
and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the
GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata,
and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure.
We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching,
affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.
This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation
and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic
tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for high-quality 3D scene stylization using reference-based attention sharing and multi-region style transfer with improved view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ensuring high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously in text-driven 3D scene editing, while enabling consistent style application to different regions with semantic correspondence.

Method: Re-trains initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images, extends style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation with reference-based attention sharing, uses grid of multiple depth maps for view consistency, and proposes Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss for region-controlled style transfer.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate effective improvement in text-driven 3D stylization results, achieving better style consistency across viewpoints and enabling faithful style transfer to distinct image regions.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully enhances 3D stylization quality while maintaining view consistency and provides optional region-controlled style transfer capabilities for mixing different styles across scene regions.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which
leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated
promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality
stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style
consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic
correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we
introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while
maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style
transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D
representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.
Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized
multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned
depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared
attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,
which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,
inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth
maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among
stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced
Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image
regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that
this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables
the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.
Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that
our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

TL;DR: DarkStream is a real-time streaming speech synthesis model for speaker anonymization that combines causal encoding, transformer layers, and direct waveform generation to achieve strong privacy protection while maintaining acceptable speech intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving real-time speech communication by developing a streaming model that can anonymize speaker identity while operating under strict latency constraints for practical deployment.

Method: Uses causal waveform encoder with short lookahead buffer, transformer-based contextual layers, direct waveform generation via neural vocoder (bypassing mel-spectrogram conversion), and injects GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embeddings into linguistic features.

Result: Achieves near-chance speaker verification performance (50% EER) on lazy-informed attack scenarios while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%).

Conclusion: DarkStream provides a practical solution for real-time speech anonymization by balancing low latency, robust privacy protection, and minimal intelligibility degradation.

Abstract: We propose DarkStream, a streaming speech synthesis model for real-time
speaker anonymization. To improve content encoding under strict latency
constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead
buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference
time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus
removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream
anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker
embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show
our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker
verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack
scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within
9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility
degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving
real-time speech communication.

*Konstantinos Drossos,Mikko Heikkinen,Paschalis Tsiaflakis*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A lightweight causal DNN method for full-band speech denoising optimized for mobile devices with low latency and high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deep neural network methods for speech denoising are not optimized for resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices, and few focus on full-band signals (48 kHz) with low latency requirements.

Method: Modified UNet architecture using look-back frames, temporal spanning convolutional kernels, and recurrent neural networks to exploit short/long temporal patterns. Uses STFT magnitude input, inverted bottlenecks from MobileNet, causal instance normalization, and operates on causal frame-by-frame basis.

Result: Achieves real-time factor below 0.02 on modern mobile phones and outperforms existing full-band low latency speech denoising methods in SI-SDR metrics on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the need for efficient, low-latency full-band speech denoising on resource-constrained mobile platforms while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Speech denoising (SD) is an important task of many, if not all, modern signal
processing chains used in devices and for everyday-life applications. While
there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods
for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile
devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on
full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency
cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight
DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal
patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing
look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent
neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal
and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis
taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired
by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise
normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a
modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech
denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and

### [254] [Room-acoustic simulations as an alternative to measurements for audio-algorithm evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05175)
*Georg Götz,Daniel Gert Nielsen,Steinar Guðjónsson,Finnur Pind*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Room-acoustic simulations can replace costly measurements for evaluating audio signal processing and machine learning algorithms, with wave-based simulations performing better than geometrical acoustics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio algorithm evaluation requires diverse acoustic conditions but real measurements are expensive and time-consuming, creating a need for simulation-based alternatives.

Method: Evaluated three ASP/AML algorithms using both real room-acoustic measurements and data from different simulation engines (wave-based solver vs geometrical acoustics simulators).

Result: Wave-based simulations produced evaluation results similar to real measurements for all three algorithms, while geometrical acoustic simulations were less reliable.

Conclusion: Numerical wave-based room-acoustic simulations can effectively replace measurements for ASP/AML algorithm evaluation, offering a cost-effective alternative to physical testing.

Abstract: Audio-signal-processing and audio-machine-learning (ASP/AML) algorithms are
ubiquitous in modern technology like smart devices, wearables, and
entertainment systems. Development of such algorithms and models typically
involves a formal evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness and progress
beyond the state-of-the-art. Ideally, a thorough evaluation should cover many
diverse application scenarios and room-acoustic conditions. However, in
practice, evaluation datasets are often limited in size and diversity because
they rely on costly and time-consuming measurements. This paper explores how
room-acoustic simulations can be used for evaluating ASP/AML algorithms. To
this end, we evaluate three ASP/AML algorithms with room-acoustic measurements
and data from different simulation engines, and assess the match between the
evaluation results obtained from measurements and simulations. The presented
investigation compares a numerical wave-based solver with two geometrical
acoustics simulators. While numerical wave-based simulations yielded similar
evaluation results as measurements for all three evaluated ASP/AML algorithms,
geometrical acoustic simulations could not replicate the measured evaluation
results as reliably.

### [255] [Universal Representation of Generalized Convex Functions and their Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04477)
*Moeen Nehzati*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents a convex parameterization method for generalized convex functions (GCFs) that satisfies the Universal Approximation Property, enabling conversion of bilevel optimization problems into single-level problems and demonstrating effectiveness in auction design applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized convex functions are solutions to many optimization problems but their characterization hasn't been fully exploited numerically. A good parameterization with Universal Approximation Property can leverage known solution structures.

Method: Extending convex function parameterization literature to GCFs, the authors develop a convex and potentially one-to-one parameterization of GCFs and their gradients that satisfies the Universal Approximation Property.

Result: The parameterization method successfully approximates any GCF arbitrarily well and has been implemented in a Python package (gconvex), demonstrating effectiveness in solving revenue-maximizing auction problems for multiple goods.

Conclusion: The proposed parameterization provides an effective numerical approach for handling GCF-based optimization problems, converting complex bilevel problems into tractable single-level optimizations with practical applications in areas like auction design.

Abstract: Solutions to a wide range of optimization problems, from optimal transport
theory to mathematical economics, often take the form of generalized convex
functions (GCFs). This characterization can be used to convert nested bilevel
optimization problems into single-level optimization problems. Despite this,
the characterization has not been fully exploited in numerical optimization.
  When the solution to an optimization problem is known to belong to a
particular class of objects, this information can be leveraged by
parameterizing that class of objects and optimizing over this parameterization.
The hallmark of a good parameterization is the Universal Approximation Property
(UAP): that is, the parameterization approximates any object in the class
arbitrarily well. For example, neural networks satisfy the UAP with respect to
the class of continuous functions.
  Building on the literature concerned with the parameterization of convex
functions, we extend these ideas to GCFs. We present a convex and potentially
one-to-one parameterization of GCFs and their gradients that satisfies the UAP.
We also compare this class to shallow neural networks and highlight their
shared characteristics.
  The ideas pursued here have been implemented in the Python package
\href{https://github.com/MoeenNehzati/gconvex}{\texttt{gconvex}}, available
online. Using it, we tackle the problem of finding the revenue-maximizing
auction for multiple goods and demonstrate how our parameterization can
effectively solve this problem.

### [256] [Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524)
*Anh Tuan Nguyen,Viet Anh Nguyen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Analysis of generalization guarantees for data-driven projection matrix learning in convex quadratic programs, extending previous work on linear programs to more complex optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Projection methods improve scalability of high-dimensional optimization problems, but existing data-driven approaches focused only on linear programs. This work extends the analysis to convex quadratic programs where optimal solutions are more complex.

Method: Proposes unrolled active set method that models optimal value computation as Goldberg-Jerrum algorithm, using Caratheodory's theorem to localize solutions within special active sets and establish learning guarantees.

Result: Develops theoretical framework for generalization guarantees in convex QPs, extends analysis to optimal solution matching and input-aware settings where projection matrices are learned from problem instances.

Conclusion: Successfully extends data-driven projection learning from LPs to convex QPs with established learning guarantees, providing foundation for scalable optimization in more complex problem domains.

Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization
instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems.
Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs
(LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances
drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the
generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for
convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex
QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this
complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this
challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized
within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing
Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled
active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a
Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing
learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings,
including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where
we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.

*Mayur S Gowda,John Shi,Augusto Santos,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Improving GNN accuracy on image datasets by finding alternative graph representations beyond traditional grid graphs and superpixel methods


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional grid graph representations of images in datasets like MNIST may not be optimal for Graph Neural Network performance, and better graph structures could improve downstream task accuracy

Method: Finding alternative graphs using row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs based on correlations between pixel values for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets

Result: Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input to downstream GNN models improves accuracy compared to traditional grid graph and superpixel methods

Conclusion: Alternative graph representations based on pixel correlations can significantly enhance GNN performance on image classification tasks, outperforming conventional approaches

Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural
Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid
graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring
pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values
(intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input
to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph
CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the
images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural
network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel
methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We
find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on
the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph
representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the
accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the
literature.

*Shuhan Ding,Jingjing Fu,Yu Gu,Naiteek Sangani,Mu Wei,Paul Vozila,Nan Liu,Jiang Bian,Hoifung Poon*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AURAD is a controllable chest X-ray synthesis framework that generates both images and pseudo semantic masks from clinical prompts, ensuring anatomical-pathological consistency and clinical relevance through expert model filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image synthesis faces challenges in fine-grained controllability due to limited annotations and domain shifts, especially in chest radiographs where disease patterns are diverse and intertwined with anatomy.

Method: Progressive pipeline: generates pseudo masks from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, then uses them to guide image synthesis. Leverages pretrained medical models for output filtering to ensure clinical plausibility.

Result: 78% of synthesized images classified as authentic by radiologists, over 40% of segmentation overlays rated clinically useful. Demonstrates effectiveness across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: AURAD bridges generative modeling with clinical applications by providing both realistic images and usable segmentation masks, enabling downstream tasks like detection and segmentation in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting
datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings.
However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to
limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing
methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to
generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically
diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these
challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that
jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity,
controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks
that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological
consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first
generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then
used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical
models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual
realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such
as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and
real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method
across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are
classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of
predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code,
pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon
publication.

### [259] [Multi-modal Uncertainty Robust Tree Cover Segmentation For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04870)
*Yuanyuan Gui,Wei Li,Yinjian Wang,Xiang-Gen Xia,Mauro Marty,Christian Ginzler,Zuyuan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MURTreeFormer is a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that addresses temporal misalignment issues in remote sensing by modeling uncertainty and reconstructing auxiliary data from primary modality distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal misalignments between multi-modal remote sensing data (optical, LiDAR, SAR) acquired days/months apart introduce cross-modal uncertainty that degrades tree cover segmentation accuracy, especially for vegetation disturbances and imaging variations.

Method: Proposes MURTreeFormer framework that treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, models patch-level uncertainty via probabilistic latent representation, uses VAE-based resampling to reconstruct uncertain patches, and integrates gradient magnitude attention and refinement head for structure guidance and detail preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Shanghai and Zurich multi-modal datasets demonstrate significant improvement in segmentation performance and effective reduction of temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty impact.

Conclusion: MURTreeFormer provides a robust solution for multi-modal tree cover mapping by explicitly addressing temporal misalignment challenges through uncertainty modeling and cross-modal reconstruction, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images
have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting
applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment.
Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light
detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown
superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are
often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may
occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and
variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce
cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can
severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose
MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and
leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer
treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling
patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent
representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the
primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism,
producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient
magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are
further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal
datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly
improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of
temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Ensembling vision-language segmentation models with low-complexity CNNs improves performance, achieving up to 6.3% Dice score improvement on medical imaging datasets compared to CLIP/BiomedCLIP baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show potential for image segmentation but implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP underperform compared to more sophisticated architectures like CRIS. The authors aim to narrow this performance gap through ensembling rather than text prompt engineering.

Method: Ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN architecture to combine their strengths and improve segmentation performance.

Result: Achieved significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on BKAI polyp dataset using ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, with gains ranging from 1% to 6% across other datasets. Results vary across different radiology and non-radiology datasets, with some outperforming and some underperforming the CRIS benchmark.

Conclusion: Ensembling VLSMs with CNNs is an effective approach to improve segmentation performance, but the effectiveness varies across different datasets, indicating this as a promising area for future community investigation.

Abstract: Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks
present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable
results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still
lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work,
instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to
narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models
(VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice
score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled
BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%.
Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and
non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across
these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model),
indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is
available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.

Motivation: To understand how GrooveTransformer's unexpected versatility and multistability emerged across different artistic contexts, despite not being an explicit design goal from the beginning.

Method: Using Variational Cross-Examination (VCE) framework to analyze the system's deployment in three distinct contexts: autonomous drum accompaniment, Eurorack rhythmic control voltage sequencer, and rhythm driver for harmonic accompaniment.

Result: Identified three key contributors to multistability emergence: affordances of system invariants, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of development.

Conclusion: VCE proves viable as a descriptive and analytical method for DMI design, revealing how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.

Abstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation
system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational
Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct
artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum
accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack
format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The
versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the
project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we
identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system
invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its
development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive
and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing
its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped

TL;DR: A coupled mechanism model-machine learning (MM-ML) framework that integrates physical constraints with data-driven learning for robust land surface temperature retrieval, achieving superior accuracy and stability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional split window algorithms show biases in humid environments, while purely machine learning methods lack interpretability and generalize poorly with limited data. Accurate LST retrieval remains challenging under heterogeneous land cover and extreme atmospheric conditions.

Method: Proposes a MM-ML framework that fuses radiative transfer modeling with data components, uses MODTRAN simulations with global atmospheric profiles, and employs physics-constrained optimization to integrate physical constraints with data-driven learning.

Result: Validation against 4,450 observations from 29 global sites shows MM-ML achieves MAE=1.84K, RMSE=2.55K, and R-squared=0.966, outperforming conventional methods. Under extreme conditions, MM-ML reduces errors by over 50%. Sensitivity analysis shows superior stability.

Conclusion: The MM-ML framework effectively combines physical interpretability with nonlinear modeling capacity, enabling reliable LST retrieval in complex environments and supporting climate monitoring and ecosystem studies.

Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is vital for land-atmosphere interactions and
climate processes. Accurate LST retrieval remains challenging under
heterogeneous land cover and extreme atmospheric conditions. Traditional split
window (SW) algorithms show biases in humid environments; purely machine
learning (ML) methods lack interpretability and generalize poorly with limited

approach fuses radiative transfer modeling with data components, uses MODTRAN

optimization. Validation against 4,450 observations from 29 global sites shows
MM-ML achieves MAE=1.84K, RMSE=2.55K, and R-squared=0.966, outperforming
conventional methods. Under extreme conditions, MM-ML reduces errors by over
50%. Sensitivity analysis indicates LST estimates are most sensitive to sensor
radiance, then water vapor, and less to emissivity, with MM-ML showing superior
stability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our coupled modeling
strategy for retrieving geophysical parameters. The MM-ML framework combines
physical interpretability with nonlinear modeling capacity, enabling reliable

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: REMOTE is a unified multimodal relation extraction framework that uses multilevel optimal transport and mixture-of-experts to extract both intra-modal and inter-modal relations between text entities and visual objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal relation extraction methods are limited to single type relational triplets and cannot handle cross-modal interactions efficiently, leading to computational redundancy and inability to extract triplets beyond specified types.

Method: Proposes REMOTE framework with mixture-of-experts mechanism for dynamic feature selection and multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level features while maintaining multilayer encoding for expressive representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show REMOTE effectively extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all metrics across multiple datasets, including their newly created UMRE dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling simultaneous extraction of intra-modal and inter-modal relations with improved feature preservation and dynamic modality selection.

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between AI and computational neuroscience by developing learning schemes that emerge naturally from recurrent dynamics without gradient computation.

Method: Asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks enhanced with sparse excitatory couplings, using iterative dynamics and distributed learning where input-output associations emerge from recurrent dynamics without gradient evaluation.

Result: The approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks, with stable configurations that persist even after supervisory signal removal.

Conclusion: The model provides a biologically plausible learning mechanism that can be generalized in computational and biological directions, potentially narrowing the gap between AI and neuroscience.

Abstract: We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with
additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large,
dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by
different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the
geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed
learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the
recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature
enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at
convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard
AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both
computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap
between AI and computational neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems, overcoming limitations of traditional methods in handling complex user behavior patterns.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with multi-intent representation module (multiple latent intent vectors with attention fusion) and uncertainty modeling mechanism (Gaussian distributions for mean and covariance). Uses learnable fusion strategy to combine long-term intent and short-term behavior signals.

Result: Outperforms existing representative models across multiple metrics on standard public datasets, demonstrating greater stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance scenarios.

Conclusion: The unified modeling strategy effectively alleviates modeling bottlenecks and shows practical value in real-world recommendation tasks, confirming the effectiveness of joint intent diversity and uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes multimodal foundation model for short video recommendation, integrating video, text, and audio with behavior sequences to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unimodal methods fail to capture user preferences in complex multimodal content environments, limiting recommendation quality.

Method: Multimodal framework with cross-modal alignment of video frames, text, and music into unified semantic space, plus behavior-driven feature embedding for dynamic interest modeling.

Result: Significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, cold-start user modeling, and recommendation click-through rates compared to mainstream algorithms.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach with interpretability mechanisms enhances recommendation performance, transparency, and controllability in short video platforms.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text
labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a
complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using

*Riddhiman Raut,Evan M. Mihalko,Amrita Basak*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A graph neural network for predicting turbulent flow and thermal behavior in complex pin-fin channels with 2-3 orders of magnitude speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a fast and accurate surrogate model for simulating complex flow configurations with arbitrarily shaped pin-fin geometries, reducing computational costs.

Method: Used automated framework to generate 1,000 diverse pin-fin configurations via Latin Hypercube Sampling, converted simulations to graph structures with spatial features, and trained a domain-responsive edge-aware multiscale Graph Neural Network.

Result: The network achieved outstanding accuracy in predicting temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure, capturing complex flow phenomena like boundary layers and recirculation while reducing computation time by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The novel graph neural network provides a fast and reliable surrogate for simulations in complex flow configurations, offering significant computational efficiency gains.

Abstract: This study presents the development of a domain-responsive edge-aware
multiscale Graph Neural Network for predicting steady, turbulent flow and
thermal behavior in a two-dimensional channel containing arbitrarily shaped
complex pin-fin geometries. The training dataset was constructed through an
automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and
flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized
using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through
Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure,
where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a
normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed
distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as
input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict
temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from
ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing
boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the
pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion,
the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for
simulations in complex flow configurations.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of continuous ensemble Kalman filter performance under different observation scenarios with rigorous error bounds and adaptive subspace dimension learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve state estimation by combining observational data with mathematical models, particularly examining signal-tracking performance under various observation conditions.

Method: Uses continuous ensemble Kalman filtering with fixed, randomized, and adaptively varying partial observations. Establishes rigorous error bounds and proposes sequential learning scheme for adaptive subspace dimension determination.

Result: Established rigorous bounds for expected signal-tracking error relative to observation operator randomness. Developed adaptive scheme that balances observation complexity with estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheme provides systematic error control and identifies appropriate filter-relevant subspace size, enhancing state estimation performance across different observation scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation that combines observational data with mathematical models is
central to many applications and is commonly addressed through filtering
methods, such as ensemble Kalman filters. In this article, we examine the
signal-tracking performance of a continuous ensemble Kalman filtering under
fixed, randomised, and adaptively varying partial observations. Rigorous bounds
are established for the expected signal-tracking error relative to the
randomness of the observation operator. In addition, we propose a sequential
learning scheme that adaptively determines the dimension of a state subspace
sufficient to ensure bounded filtering error, by balancing observation
complexity with estimation accuracy. Beyond error control, the adaptive scheme
provides a systematic approach to identifying the appropriate size of the
filter-relevant subspace of the underlying dynamics.

*Inés Gonzalez-Pepe,Vinuyan Sivakolunthu,Yohan Chatelain,Tristan Glatard*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DL training introduces numerical instability through stochastic optimization, but this variability can be harnessed as a resource for ensemble methods and data augmentation in neuroimaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the numerical stability of deep learning models during training in neuroimaging, particularly the variability introduced by stochastic optimization methods, and explore whether this instability can be repurposed as a beneficial resource.

Method: Used FastSurfer (CNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline) with controlled perturbations via floating point operations and random seeds to study training-time variability, comparing it to traditional neuroimaging pipelines and testing ensemble performance.

Result: Found that FastSurfer exhibits higher variability than traditional pipelines, ensembles with perturbations achieve similar performance to unperturbed baseline, and numerical ensembles can be repurposed for downstream applications like brain age regression as data augmentation.

Conclusion: Training-time variability should be viewed not just as a reproducibility concern but as a valuable resource that can improve robustness and enable new applications in neuroimaging through ensemble methods and data augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is rapidly advancing neuroimaging by achieving
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computation times. Yet the numerical
stability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains
underexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training
introduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic
optimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a
CNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline. Controlled perturbations are
introduced via floating point perturbations and random seeds. We find that: (i)
FastSurfer exhibits higher variability compared to that of a traditional
neuroimaging pipeline, suggesting that DL inherits and is particularly
susceptible to sources of instability present in its predecessors; (ii)
ensembles generated with perturbations achieve performance similar to an
unperturbed baseline; and (iii) variability effectively produces ensembles of
numerical model families that can be repurposed for downstream applications. As
a proof of concept, we demonstrate that numerical ensembles can be used as a
data augmentation strategy for brain age regression. These findings position
training-time variability not only as a reproducibility concern but also as a
resource that can be harnessed to improve robustness and enable new
applications in neuroimaging.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: GetNetUPAM is a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework for evaluating underwater acoustic monitoring models, paired with ARPA-N neural architecture that achieves 14.4% precision improvement and significantly reduced variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring faces challenges with noise, signal dependencies, and environmental variability that hinder model stability and generalization across different sites and years.

Method: Hierarchical nested cross-validation framework (GetNetUPAM) partitioning data into site-year segments, combined with ARPA-N neural network featuring adaptive resolution pooling and spatial attention for irregular spectrogram dimensions.

Result: ARPA-N achieves 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and order-of-magnitude reduction in variability across all metrics, enabling consistent detection across diverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and architecture significantly improve model stability and generalization for underwater bioacoustic monitoring, advancing scalable and accurate ecological analysis.

Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal
data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal
dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing
has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient
noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic
sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce
GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to
quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are
partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording
heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental
subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year
blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while
standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across
UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.
Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution
Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular
spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the
receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under
GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet
baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all
metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing
scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

*Mutsumi Kobayashi,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to analyze and compose music in J.S. Bach's style, providing interpretable insights into musical characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning models for music composition are too complex to understand how they capture composer styles. RBMs offer simpler structure for analysis.

Method: Trained a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) on J.S. Bach's music compositions to learn his musical style.

Result: The learned RBM successfully composed music in Bach's style and allowed investigation of internal states to understand learned musical characteristics.

Conclusion: RBMs provide an interpretable alternative to complex models for music style analysis and composition, enabling better understanding of how AI systems learn musical patterns.

Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the
style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such
software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is
difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the
composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it
allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the
learned RBM is able to compose music.

Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems by developing an effective adversarial attack framework that can work in both white-box and black-box scenarios while maintaining audio fidelity.

Method: Uses importance analysis to identify critical audio segments, then modifies them using generative inpainting models guided by the target model's output to create subtle adversarial perturbations.

Result: Achieves high attack success rates in both white-box and black-box settings with minimal perceptual distortion, confirmed by subjective listening tests showing high audio fidelity.

Conclusion: Highlights vulnerabilities in current MIR systems and emphasizes the need for more robust and secure models to defend against such adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Music adversarial attacks have garnered significant interest in the field of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we present Music Adversarial
Inpainting Attack (MAIA), a novel adversarial attack framework that supports
both white-box and black-box attack scenarios. MAIA begins with an importance
analysis to identify critical audio segments, which are then targeted for
modification. Utilizing generative inpainting models, these segments are
reconstructed with guidance from the output of the attacked model, ensuring
subtle and effective adversarial perturbations. We evaluate MAIA on multiple
MIR tasks, demonstrating high attack success rates in both white-box and
black-box settings while maintaining minimal perceptual distortion.
Additionally, subjective listening tests confirm the high audio fidelity of the
adversarial samples. Our findings highlight vulnerabilities in current MIR
systems and emphasize the need for more robust and secure models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing complex real-world sound scenes is difficult because individual sound sources overlap in time, requiring generative models to fill-in missing or corrupted details based on strong prior understanding of the data domain.

Method: Encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on synthetic audio example pairs formed by adding isolated sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Uses textual edit descriptions and graphical event timing representations.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that 'recomposition' is an important and practical application for audio editing in complex scenes.

Abstract: Editing complex real-world sound scenes is difficult because individual sound

encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on
synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing demand for LLM services creates substantial deployment and computation costs, requiring efficient routing solutions that can handle online settings with high query volume and constrained token budgets.

Method: Leverages approximate nearest neighbor search to estimate query features and performs one-time optimization over a small initial query set to learn a routing strategy for future queries.

Result: Achieves competitive ratio of 1 - o(1) theoretically, with experimental results showing 3.55x overall performance improvement, 1.85x cost efficiency, and nearly 4.25x throughput across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free algorithm provides an effective solution for online LLM routing, significantly outperforming existing methods while being computationally efficient and scalable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model

scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally curated tabular data often have representational inconsistencies and sparse metadata, making schema inference difficult despite advances in dataset discovery.

Method: SI-LLM infers conceptual schemas using only column headers and cell values from tabular data, producing hierarchical entity types, attributes, and relationships through large language models.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results and performs better or comparable to state-of-the-art methods on web tables and open data datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses schema inference challenges in data with limited metadata, with all source code, prompts, and datasets made publicly available.

Abstract: Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies

We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: TreeIndex: A novel index method for exact resistance distance computation on small-treewidth graphs using tree decompositions, achieving compact labelling and efficient query times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing random walk-based methods for resistance distance computation are limited to approximate solutions and suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs like road networks, while shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on such graphs.

Method: Analyzes cut property of resistance distance and integrates tree decompositions to reveal that resistance distance depends only on labels along paths to the root. Constructs a resistance distance labelling of size O(n·h_G) in O(n·h_G²·d_max) time.

Result: TreeIndex constructs a 405 GB labelling on full USA road network in 7 hours (single-threaded), answers exact single-pair queries in 10^-3 seconds and single-source queries in 190 seconds - the first exact method scalable to such large graphs.

Conclusion: TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, providing the first exact and scalable solution for resistance distance computation on large small-treewidth graphs like road networks.

Abstract: Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,
yet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and
suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In
contrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on
such graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by
this disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While
a direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we
overcome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the
resistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$
and $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact
labelling structures. Based on this, we propose \treeindex, a novel index
method that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \cdot
h_{\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}}^2 \cdot d_{\max})$ time, where
$h_{\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small
constants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our
labelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time and
single-source queries in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive
experiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$
GB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair
queries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the
first exact method scalable to such large graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge computational neuroscience and AI by creating scalable environments that can effectively shape behavior and probe learning mechanisms in biological neural networks.

Method: Three virtual environments with increasing complexity (avoidance task, predator-prey, Pong) with formalized state/action spaces, sensory encoding, and feedback protocols. Uses LLM for automated experimental protocol generation and optimization.

Result: Proposes a complete framework including environment design, meta-learning approach with LLMs, and multi-modal evaluation methods for measuring synaptic plasticity at multiple levels.

Conclusion: This work provides a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in biological substrates, bridging AI and neuroscience research.

Abstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments
that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a
critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle
to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural
organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual
environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the
underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task
environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2)
a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic
Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the
sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols
based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.
Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language
Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental
protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,
we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic
plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work
bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering
a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a

*Sahil Tomar,Sandeep Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum image compression method using block intensities and amplitude embedding with constant qubit requirements independent of image resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a hardware-efficient quantum image compression method suitable for near-term quantum devices that maintains constant qubit usage regardless of image resolution.

Method: Segments images into fixed-size blocks (bixels), computes block intensities, constructs global histogram with B bins, encodes normalized square roots of bin counts as amplitudes into n-qubit quantum state using PennyLane on IBM Quantum hardware, then measures to reconstruct histogram and reassemble image.

Result: Achieves high quality reconstructions using only 5-7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel-level encodings in qubit efficiency, with constant qubit requirements based solely on histogram bins.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical quantum image compression approach for NISQ era systems, allowing users to control fidelity-resource trade-off through bin count adjustment while maintaining hardware efficiency.

Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing
color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image
into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within
each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block
intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as
amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed
using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state
is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of
block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant
qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of
the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off
between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality
reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming
conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating
the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: RobQFL introduces adversarial training in quantum federated learning, showing that training only 20-50% of clients with adversarial examples significantly improves robustness with minimal clean accuracy cost, while data heterogeneity halves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Federated Learning combines privacy benefits with quantum computing advantages, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks was unknown and needed investigation.

Method: Proposed Robust Quantum Federated Learning (RobQFL) with tunable parameters: client coverage (γ), perturbation scheduling (fixed-ε vs ε-mixes), and optimization approaches (fine-tune vs scratch training). Evaluated on 15-client simulations with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets under IID and Non-IID conditions.

Result: Training only 20-50% of clients adversarially improved ε≤0.1 accuracy by ~15 percentage points with <2 pp clean-accuracy cost. Fine-tuning added 3-5 pp improvement. Moderate ε-mix optimal at ≥75% coverage, while high-ε schedules only helped at 100% coverage. Label-sorted non-IID splits reduced robustness by half.

Conclusion: Quantum Federated Learning is fragile to adversarial noise like centralized quantum learning. RobQFL effectively enhances robustness, with data heterogeneity being a dominant risk factor that significantly impacts model resilience.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) merges privacy-preserving federation with
quantum computing gains, yet its resilience to adversarial noise is unknown. We
first show that QFL is as fragile as centralized quantum learning. We propose
Robust Quantum Federated Learning (RobQFL), embedding adversarial training
directly into the federated loop. RobQFL exposes tunable axes: client coverage
$\gamma$ (0-100\%), perturbation scheduling (fixed-$\varepsilon$ vs
$\varepsilon$-mixes), and optimization (fine-tune vs scratch), and distils the
resulting $\gamma \times \varepsilon$ surface into two metrics:
Accuracy-Robustness Area and Robustness Volume. On 15-client simulations with
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, IID and Non-IID conditions, training only 20-50\%
clients adversarially boosts $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$ accuracy $\sim$15 pp at $<
2$ pp clean-accuracy cost; fine-tuning adds 3-5 pp. With $\geq$75\% coverage, a
moderate $\varepsilon$-mix is optimal, while high-$\varepsilon$ schedules help
only at 100\% coverage. Label-sorted non-IID splits halve robustness,
underscoring data heterogeneity as a dominant risk.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential scaling of Hilbert space with system size makes efficient characterization of large-scale quantum systems from analog simulators and quantum computers a central challenge in quantum science.

learning, and, in particular, deep learning and language models. This review
discusses how each of these AI paradigms contributes to two core tasks in
quantum systems characterization: quantum property prediction and the
construction of surrogates for quantum states. These tasks underlie diverse
applications, from quantum certification and benchmarking to the enhancement of
quantum algorithms and the understanding of strongly correlated phases of
matter. Key challenges and open questions are also discussed, together with
future prospects at the interface of AI and quantum science.

Abstract: This work presents a fully quantum approach to support vector machine (SVM)
learning by integrating gate-based quantum kernel methods with quantum
annealing-based optimization. We explore the construction of quantum kernels
using various feature maps and qubit configurations, evaluating their
suitability through Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA). The SVM dual problem is
reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem,
enabling its solution via quantum annealers. Our experiments demonstrate that a
high degree of alignment in the kernel and an appropriate regularization
parameter lead to competitive performance, with the best model achieving an
F1-score of 90%. These results highlight the feasibility of an end-to-end
quantum learning pipeline and the potential of hybrid quantum architectures in
quantum high-performance computing (QHPC) contexts.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced property alignment of generated molecules, with reinforcement learning agents effectively balancing multiple chemical properties.

Conclusion: The proposed QCA-MolGAN approach successfully generates drug-like molecules with optimized target properties through quantum-enabled generative modeling and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Navigating the vast chemical space of molecular structures to design novel
drug molecules with desired target properties remains a central challenge in
drug discovery. Recent advances in generative models offer promising solutions.
This work presents a novel quantum circuit Born machine (QCBM)-enabled
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), called QCA-MolGAN, for generating
drug-like molecules. The QCBM serves as a learnable prior distribution, which
is associatively trained to define a latent space aligning with high-level
features captured by the GANs discriminator. Additionally, we integrate a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning network to guide molecular generation with
desired targeted properties, optimising key metrics such as quantitative
estimate of drug-likeness (QED), octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) and
synthetic accessibility (SA) scores in conjunction with one another.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the property
alignment of generated molecules with the multi-agent reinforcement learning
agents effectively balancing chemical properties.

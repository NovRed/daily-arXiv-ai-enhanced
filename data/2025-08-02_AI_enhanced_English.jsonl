Leveraging the\nintrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored\nexpert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.\nHowever, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify\ncritical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the\nheterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first\ndiscovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial\nrole in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These\nexperts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited\nnumber, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,\npruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative\noutputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive\nanalysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are\ncharacterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the\ndown_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between\ndecoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is\nunaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their\nsignificance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on\nthe model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)\nWe further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our\nfindings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are\ncrucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly\ndisrupted by SE pruning.

This question of model selection is traditionally\nanswered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and\ntime-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in\nthe candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian\ninference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is\ncollected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark\ntasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing\nmethods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation\neffort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art.

However, these fully automatic methods often\nfail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological\nconstraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.\nIn medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of\nthe required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the\npixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and\nconstrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology\n(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional\ndata due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel topology-aware segmentation method using the Euler Characteristic (\u03c7) to improve topological correctness in medical images while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.", "motivation": "Existing topology-aware methods based on persistent homology are computationally complex and hard to implement for high-dimensional data, limiting their clinical applicability.", "method": "Proposes a fast \u03c7 computation for 2D/3D data, uses \u03c7 error as a metric, generates topological violation maps, and refines segmentation via a correction network.", "result": "Experiments on 2D/3D datasets show significant improvement in topological correctness without compromising pixel-wise accuracy.", "conclusion": "The method offers a computationally efficient solution for topology-aware medical image segmentation, addressing clinical needs for topological accuracy."}}

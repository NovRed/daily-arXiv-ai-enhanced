However, counterfactual models struggle to produce\nanatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to\npreserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the\ntraining of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the\nimages (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically\nrelevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we\npropose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as\nprior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph\nModel (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic\ngraph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of\nregions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of\nControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings\nare then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates\nstructural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.\nFurthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from\ncounterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease\non cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.\nThis achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in\nstudies investigating subtle morphological differences.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCGM is a novel diffusion-based framework that generates anatomically plausible 3D brain MRIs by integrating probabilistic anatomical constraints to preserve subtle disease-related morphological variations.", "motivation": "3D brain MRI studies need to detect subtle morphometric differences between cohorts, but current counterfactual models fail to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to lack of explicit anatomical constraints and focus on overall appearance rather than medically relevant local variations.", "method": "Proposes Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM) that integrates anatomical constraints via probabilistic graph module, generates spatial binary masks of regions with subtle variations, uses 3D ControlNet encoding, and employs a novel counterfactual denoising UNet with 3D diffusion decoder.", "result": "PCGM generates higher quality structural brain MRIs than baseline approaches.

The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the\nagent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining\nexternal guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined\nwith a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different\nlevels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental\nevaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves\nsignificantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability\nto effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also\nshows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental\ninformation.

Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,\nMRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most\nsegmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities\nand cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to\nunseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.\nThis work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that\ncontain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,\nand heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any\navailable imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,\nthus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a\nmodality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input\nchannels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image\naugmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities.

We propose LoCoBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in\nrealistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code\nevaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context\ntasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context\ncapabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across\nmultiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale\nsoftware systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios\nsystematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths\nspanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of\nlong-context performance degradation in realistic software development\nsettings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential\nlong-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,\nmulti-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code\ncomprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase\npipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to\nreason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,\nincluding 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial\nperformance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex\nsoftware development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands\nmore attention.

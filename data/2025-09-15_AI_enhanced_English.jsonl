In recent years, many\nonline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn\nconstructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL\nmethods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may\nnot capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization\nleads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce\nConservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL\nalgorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical\ndata, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining\nthe ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a\nquantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return\ndistribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs\noutright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to\nlearn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original\ndata-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL\nbaselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20\ntraining instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that\nCDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than\nwhen trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority\ndispatching rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDQAC is a novel offline RL algorithm that learns job-shop scheduling policies directly from historical data without online interactions, outperforming both data-generating heuristics and state-of-the-art RL methods with high sample efficiency.", "motivation": "Address limitations of online RL methods for JSP/FJSP that require millions of simulated interactions and suffer from poor sample efficiency due to random policy initialization, while needing to capture real-world complexities.", "method": "Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC) couples a quantile-based critic with delayed policy updates, estimating return distributions for machine-operation pairs rather than direct selection.", "result": "CDQAC consistently outperforms original data-generating heuristics and state-of-the-art offline/online RL baselines, showing remarkable performance with only 10-20 training instances.

However, a persistent challenge is the\nprevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,\nwhich severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the\ndiversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained\nevaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To\nfill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for\nartifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image\nartifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the\nfirst human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with\nfine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,\na Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and\ncorresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward\nhacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward\nsystem for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage\nMagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating\nthe image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench\nreveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like\nGPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting\nartifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

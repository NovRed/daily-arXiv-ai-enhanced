However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these\nweighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for\nexplanation purposes.", "AI": {"tldr": "ITL-LIME enhances LIME's explanation stability in data-scarce environments by using instance transfer learning with real source domain instances instead of random perturbations, improving fidelity through clustering and contrastive learning-based weighting.", "motivation": "LIME's randomness in perturbation and sampling causes locality and instability issues, especially with limited training data, leading to unrealistic variations and poor approximation of complex decision boundaries.", "method": "Proposes ITL-LIME framework that uses clustering to partition source domain, retrieves relevant real source instances instead of random perturbations, combines with target neighbors, and employs contrastive learning-based encoder for weighting instances based on proximity.", "result": "Enhanced explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained environments by leveraging transfer learning and real instances from related source domains.", "conclusion": "ITL-LIME effectively addresses LIME's limitations in data-scarce scenarios by incorporating instance transfer learning and real data instances, providing more stable and faithful explanations."}}

We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras.

We\nintroduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept\nRepresentations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide\nmodels toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly\nimproves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective\neven in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy\nbinary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic\nspurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared\nto baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc\nconcept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic\nstrategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept\nsupervision.

However, traditional timing\noptimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to\niteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this\npaper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of\ntiming violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.\nSpecifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a\nSignal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation\npath analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of\nviolations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively\nretrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to\ngenerate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source\nprojects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results\nshow that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing\nviolations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%.

However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world\nscenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such\nas multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a\npromising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence\nmodeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations\nstill remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,\nSymbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a\nneuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable\nmulti-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic\nplanner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic\nsubgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer\n(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot\nmanipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,\nand generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.\nWe evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations.

While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally\nmuch larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and\nsubsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics\n\\emph{interpolate between the $\\mu$P regime and another regime that we call\nLarge Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those\npredicted by $\\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal\nembedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{width})$,\nsurprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the\nliterature, and different from the $\\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\\mu$P.\nWe conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model\nfrom scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the\nembedding LR.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

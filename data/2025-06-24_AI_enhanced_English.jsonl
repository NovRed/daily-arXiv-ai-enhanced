Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought.

Thyroid\nnodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some\nrequire further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its\neffectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,\ncausing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College\nof Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been\ndeveloped to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by\ninterobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to\nimprove risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal\nand spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global\ninformation and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this\nwork, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid\nUltrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel\nrepresentation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine\nclips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a\npretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,\nour model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while\nenhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our\nmodel improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,\nachieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1\nscore of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02).

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt\nsensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce\ninconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These\ninsights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing\nfuture code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM\ncapabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates prompt sensitivity in code benchmarks for LLMs, revealing that minor prompt variations can significantly impact performance and model rankings, advocating for more robust benchmark designs.", "motivation": "Existing code benchmarks rely on single prompt templates, making them prone to prompt sensitivity, which undermines reliable evaluation of LLM capabilities.", "method": "A general framework for modifying prompt templates while preserving semantics and structure is proposed, followed by experiments on eight tasks with 100 prompt variations each, tested on 10 LLMs.", "result": "Slight prompt variations cause significant performance shifts and inconsistencies in model rankings, highlighting prompt sensitivity as a critical issue.", "conclusion": "Future code benchmarks must account for prompt sensitivity to ensure reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM capabilities."}}

It introduces a suite of\nmodels that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,\nbridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and\nkernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature\nkernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;\nthe Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight\nspace for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based\nmodels where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion\nprocesses, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph\nneural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature\nFeatures, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and\nRecurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian\nprocesses, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting\nmechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context\nlength.\n  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual\nbridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in\nscalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores using path signatures in machine learning for sequential and structured data, introducing scalable models like Gaussian processes with signature kernels and Seq2Tens for long-range dependencies.", "motivation": "To address challenges in real-world time series and graph data, such as irregular sampling and long-range dependencies, by leveraging path signatures for robust feature representation.", "method": "Combines path signatures with Gaussian processes, deep learning, and kernel methods, introducing models like signature kernel-based Gaussian processes, Seq2Tens, and graph-based models with expected signatures.", "result": "Develops scalable and theoretically robust models, including Random Fourier Signature Features and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, for uncertainty-aware and adaptive forecasting.", "conclusion": "The thesis provides a methodological toolkit and conceptual bridge for scalable, signature-based learning, advancing the field of sequential and structured data analysis."}}

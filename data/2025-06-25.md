### [1] [Correspondence-Free Multiview Point Cloud Registration via Depth-Guided Joint Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18922)
*Yiran Zhou,Yingyu Wang,Shoudong Huang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel correspondence-free multiview point cloud registration method is introduced, leveraging raw depth information for joint pose and global map estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based methods struggle with global optimal solutions in complex environments due to challenges in feature extraction and data association.

Method: Represents the global map as a depth map and formulates a non-linear least squares optimisation to jointly estimate poses and the global map, bypassing explicit feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, especially in challenging environments where feature extraction is difficult.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust alternative to traditional feature-based approaches, achieving higher accuracy without explicit data association.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

### [2] [Connecting Vision and Emissions: A Behavioural AI Approach to Carbon Estimation in Road Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18924)
*Ammar K Al Mhdawi,Nonso Nnamoko,Safanah Mudheher Raafat,M. K. S. Al-Mhdawi,Amjad J Humaidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced YOLOv8 framework for real-time vehicle detection, classification, and carbon emission estimation, integrating deep OCR for license plate recognition and validation with external databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise, automated carbon emission monitoring in urban environments by combining real-time vehicle detection with fine-grained recognition tasks like license plate reading.

Method: Enhances YOLOv8 with a hybrid pipeline for vehicle detection, segmentation, tracking, and deep OCR for license plate recognition. Uses a CNN-based OCR module and validates data via an external API.

Result: YOLOv8 achieved 71% mAP@0.5 for detection and 70% for segmentation. OCR accuracy reached 99%.

Conclusion: The framework is feasible for smart transportation systems, offering scalable vehicle-specific carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

### [3] [Interpretable and Granular Video-Based Quantification of Motor Characteristics from the Finger Tapping Test in Parkinson Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18925)
*Tahereh Zarrat Ehsan,Michael Tangermann,Yağmur Güçlütürk,Bastiaan R. Bloem,Luc J. W. Evers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision-based method quantifies Parkinson's disease motor characteristics from video, improving accuracy and granularity over subjective clinical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms lack precision and consistency. This paper aims to provide an objective, granular assessment using video analysis.

Method: Proposes four sets of features from video recordings to characterize motor deficits. Uses PCA and machine learning to predict MDS-UPDRS scores.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy in MDS-UPDRS score prediction and identifies granular distinctions in motor deficits.

Conclusion: The framework offers an objective, interpretable solution for assessing PD motor characteristics, applicable in clinical and remote settings.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

### [4] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Grouping for Tubular Structure Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18930)
*Chong Di,Shuwang Zhou,Da Chen,Jean-Marie Mirebeau,Minglei Shu,Laurent D. Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reinforcement learning framework for segment-wise tracking of tubular structures, outperforming existing methods by dynamically exploring segments via Q-Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segment-wise tracking methods are computationally inefficient and rely heavily on prior knowledge, limiting their adaptability to complex morphologies.

Method: Proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework using Q-Learning to dynamically explore segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches, handling complex topologies and maintaining global coherence without extensive prior knowledge.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust, efficient solution for tracking tubular structures, reducing reliance on prior assumptions and improving adaptability.

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

### [5] [Bird's-eye view safety monitoring for the construction top under the tower crane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18938)
*Yanke Wang,Yu Hin Ng,Haobo Liang,Ching-Wei Chang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI-based automated safety monitoring system for tower cranes uses 3D data fusion from cameras and LiDAR to protect workers and prevent collisions, proving effective in real-site tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for enhanced safety in automated tower crane operations, especially for human workers and collision avoidance, drives the development of this system.

Method: The system integrates camera and LiDAR data for 3D fusion, employs state-of-the-art AI methods, and includes hardware and display systems for real-time monitoring.

Result: The system successfully localizes humans and objects, provides alarms for collision avoidance, and demonstrates accuracy and effectiveness in real-site applications.

Conclusion: The proposed system serves as a valuable safety monitoring toolkit, improving protection for workers and crane operations in construction sites.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation
procedure, and importantly, the application of automation technologies to the
safety issues is imperative ahead of the utilization of any other advances.
Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular
Integrated Construction (MiC) lifted. Also, the camera and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR) can capture abundant 3D information on site, which is however
yet made the best use. Considering the safety protection for humans and tower
cranes, we present an AI-based fully automated safety monitoring system for
tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans
and MiCs by integrating the captured information from camera and LiDAR. The
state-of-the-art methods were explored and implemented into our proposed
software pipeline coupled with the hardware and display systems. Furthermore,
we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and
visualization on the real site proved that our system can serve as a valuable
safety monitoring toolkit on site.

### [6] [Damba-ST: Domain-Adaptive Mamba for Efficient Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18939)
*Rui An,Yifeng Zhang,Ziran Liang,Wenqi Fan,Yuxuan Liang,Xuequn Shang,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Damba-ST is a domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction, addressing limitations of Transformer-based models by leveraging linear complexity and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable urban spatio-temporal models is challenging due to computational inefficiency and domain heterogeneity in existing approaches.

Method: Proposes Damba-ST with a domain-adaptive state space model and three Domain Adapters to align cross-domain commonalities and capture domain-specific features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in new urban environments without retraining.

Conclusion: Damba-ST offers a scalable and efficient solution for urban spatio-temporal prediction, overcoming limitations of prior models.

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [From Pixels and Words to Waves: A Unified Framework for Spectral Dictionary vLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18943)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDict-VLM replaces convolutions and self-attention with a spectral dictionary token mixer, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify vision-language models by removing computationally intensive components (convolutions and self-attention) while maintaining performance.

Method: Introduces a spectral dictionary token mixer, representing image patches or wordpieces as sparse combinations of learnable frequency atoms.

Result: Achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, SPICE of 27.0 on MS-COCO, and 50.3% accuracy on VQAv2, with 60% fewer parameters and faster inference.

Conclusion: SDict-VLM is the first VLM to eliminate convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer baselines, offering efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

### [8] [DiffRIS: Enhancing Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18946)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRIS, a novel framework for referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS), leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to address challenges like scale variations and semantic ambiguities in aerial imagery. It introduces a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) for improved segmentation, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods struggle with complex object characteristics in aerial imagery, such as scale variations and semantic ambiguities. The paper aims to enhance cross-modal alignment for precise segmentation using pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: DiffRIS combines a CP-adapter for refining linguistic features and a PCMRD for aligning textual descriptions with visual regions. The CP-adapter bridges domain gaps, while PCMRD ensures fine-grained semantic alignment.

Result: DiffRIS outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, RISBench), achieving state-of-the-art performance in RRSIS tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages pre-trained diffusion models for remote sensing, demonstrating significant performance improvements and setting a new benchmark for RRSIS.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

### [9] [GLIMPSE: Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation for Generative LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18985)
*Guanxi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for visualizing visual and textual saliency in LVLMs during VQA, outperforming prior methods in human-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where LVLMs focus visually and textually is crucial for transparency, diagnosing issues like hallucination and bias.

Method: GLIMPSE combines gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to produce attribution heatmaps.

Result: It provides fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal reasoning, hallucination, and bias, aligning better with human attention.

Conclusion: GLIMPSE advances interpretability in LVLMs, offering tools to analyze and improve model behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

### [10] [Diffusion Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation for High-Resolution Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18999)
*Yuan Yao,Yicong Hong,Difan Liu,Long Mai,Feng Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2MD, a method to distill self-attention-based diffusion transformers into linear-complexity Mamba models, enabling efficient high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of self-attention in diffusion transformers for high-resolution image generation, and the empirical challenges of direct Mamba training.

Method: Proposes T2MD, a distillation pipeline combining self-attention and Mamba, with layer-level teacher forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves efficient 2048×2048 image generation with low overhead and high quality, demonstrating Mamba's feasibility for non-causal visual tasks.

Conclusion: T2MD successfully bridges self-attention and Mamba, offering a scalable and efficient solution for high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

### [11] [Orthogonal Projection Subspace to Aggregate Online Prior-knowledge for Continual Test-time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19022)
*Jinlong Li,Dong Zhao,Qi Zang,Zequn Jie,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OoPk, a method for Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) using orthogonal projection and online prior-knowledge aggregation to balance performance and adaptation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation in CTTA, especially in complex tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Uses orthogonal projection to preserve source model knowledge and an aggressive image masking strategy for domain adaptability.

Result: Outperforms previous CTTA methods in semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: OoPk effectively balances adaptation and performance, reducing forgetting and error accumulation.

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale pretrained models for OMR and the absence of standardized evaluation for end-to-end OMR systems.

Method: Combines a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder, trained on 214K+ images, to generalize across typeset scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and metrics.

Conclusion: Legato sets a new benchmark for end-to-end OMR, demonstrating strong generalization and performance.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music
recognition (OMR). Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable
of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

*Yimu Wang,Mozhgan Nasr Azadani,Sean Sedwards,Krzysztof Czarnecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAWAII is a framework that distills knowledge from multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational costs of using multiple pretrained visual experts in vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: Uses teacher-specific LoRA adapters with a router to avoid conflicts and switches between teacher-specific knowledge. Combines fine-grained (token importance scores) and coarse-grained (general-knowledge LoRA adapters) distillation.

Result: Outperforms popular open-source VLMs on various vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: HAWAII effectively balances performance and computational efficiency for VLMs.

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision Language Models (VLMs) infer emotions, focusing on visual cues like teeth visibility and facial attributes, revealing potential biases and fairness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the psychological grounding of visual cues used by VLMs in emotion recognition and identify risks like shortcut learning and bias.

Method: Benchmarking VLMs on a teeth-annotated subset of AffectNet and introspecting GPT-4o to analyze facial attributes like eyebrow position.

Result: VLMs show performance shifts based on teeth visibility, and GPT-4o's reasoning aligns with facial attributes, indicating internal consistency in valence-arousal predictions.

Conclusion: While VLMs exhibit emergent behavior in affective computing, they also pose risks of bias and fairness issues, particularly in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

TL;DR: RareSpot is a detection framework for small, rare wildlife in aerial imagery, combining multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation to improve accuracy by 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of elusive species like prairie dogs is vital for conservation but challenging due to their small size and sparse distribution.

Method: RareSpot integrates multi-scale consistency learning for feature alignment and context-aware augmentation to synthesize difficult training samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by 35%, and generalizes well across wildlife datasets.

Conclusion: RareSpot advances ecological monitoring and sets a foundation for detecting small, rare species in aerial imagery.

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

*Ilia Beletskii,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework enhances image inversion using consistency models for high-quality editing in just four steps, outperforming full-step diffusion models in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for image editing are computationally intensive, and distilled models suffer from poor inversion quality, limiting editing capabilities.

Method: Proposes a cycle-consistency optimization strategy to improve reconstruction accuracy and balance editability with content preservation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image editing tasks, matching or surpassing full-step diffusion models while being more efficient.

Conclusion: The method enables high-fidelity inversion and editing with minimal computational steps, offering a practical solution for precise image manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

*Christina Ourania Tze,Daniel Dauner,Yiyi Liao,Dzmitry Tsishkou,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrITTI introduces a latent diffusion-based framework using 3D primitives for scalable, editable 3D scene generation, outperforming voxel-based methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of voxel-based representations (memory-intensive, fixed resolution, hard to edit) by leveraging compact, manipulable primitives for 3D semantic scene generation.

Method: Uses a hybrid representation: rasterized ground surfaces and vectorized 3D primitives for objects, with a structured latent space for flexible manipulation. Introduces a Cholesky-based parameterization for stable encoding of object size and orientation.

Result: Outperforms voxel-based methods on KITTI-360 dataset in generation quality, reduces memory usage by 3x, and supports instance-level manipulation and downstream tasks like inpainting and synthesis.

Conclusion: PrITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of primitive-based representations for scalable, controllable, and editable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

### [18] [Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154)
*Mahdi Falaki,Maria A. Amer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm using MobileViT is proposed, achieving high accuracy with low computational cost and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality tracking struggles in challenging conditions; multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T) is needed but often computationally expensive.

Method: Progressive fusion framework with separable attention for intra- and inter-modal interactions between template and search regions.

Result: Comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art, with <4M parameters and 122 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: First MobileViT-based RGB-T tracker, offering efficiency and performance; code and weights will be public.

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a lightweight, perceptually-aligned framework for keyframe extraction in videos, designed to identify standout moments without deep learning, offering interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online videos amplify cyber social threats like misinformation and radicalization, necessitating tools for detecting impactful moments for moderation and analysis.

Method: PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space, using perceptual color difference metrics to identify keyframes aligned with human visual sensitivity, avoiding deep learning.

Result: PRISM achieves strong accuracy and fidelity on benchmark datasets (BBC, TVSum, SumMe, ClipShots) with high compression ratios, suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: PRISM is effective for structured and unstructured video content, offering a scalable solution for moderating harmful or politically sensitive media.

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework (MOSCARD) integrates CXR and ECG for better MACE risk prediction, outperforming single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MACE is a leading global cause of mortality, and current screening methods have limitations like sampling bias and single-modality constraints.

Method: MOSCARD combines CXR and ECG using multimodal alignment, causal reasoning, and a dual back-propagation graph to mitigate bias.

Result: The model achieved AUCs of 0.75, 0.83, and 0.71 on internal, ED shift, and MIMIC datasets, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSCARD offers cost-effective, early MACE risk screening, improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

Result: OW achieves up to 0.981 mAP50 with fine-tuning and 0.597 mAP50 on novel species datasets, capturing 95% of species while exploring only 33% of images.

Conclusion: OW is a flexible, cost-effective solution for biodiversity assessments, with publicly released code and datasets for reproducibility.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Method: Categorizes studies by script types, analyzes recognition methods, and reviews solutions for unique challenges like data imbalance and degradation.

Result: Highlights differences and shared strategies among methods, reviews recent solutions, and identifies current limitations.

Conclusion: Provides a structured perspective to support advancements in ancient script recognition, interpretation, and decipherment.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: MedErr-CT is a new benchmark for evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports, addressing gaps in existing VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for CT examinations and concerns about diagnostic errors, coupled with MLLMs' tendency for inaccuracies, necessitate rigorous validation tools.

Method: Introduces MedErr-CT, a VQA framework with six error categories (vision-centric and lexical) and three task levels (classification, detection, correction).

Result: Quantitative assessment of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs shows significant performance variation across error types.

Conclusion: MedErr-CT aids in developing more reliable, clinically applicable MLLMs to reduce diagnostic errors and improve clinical accuracy.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: Video-XL-2 is a novel MLLM for long-video understanding, using task-aware KV sparsification to balance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to high computational and memory costs, limiting performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes chunk-based pre-filling (sparse attention across chunks) and bi-level key-value decoding (selective reloading of dense/sparse KV).

Result: Achieves SOTA on benchmarks, processing 10,000+ frames efficiently on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: Video-XL-2 offers a cost-effective solution for long-video understanding with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods for unimodal models are inadequate for VLMs, and current datasets lack nuanced reasoning for multimodal threats.

Method: Introduces MSR-Align, a dataset with multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and quality filtering, used to fine-tune VLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and maintains general reasoning performance.

Conclusion: MSR-Align offers a scalable solution for improving safety alignment in reasoning-capable VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our

Motivation: Addresses challenges of data gathering and annotation for novel/sensitive tasks by automating dataset creation and model training.

Method: Introduces AIR-Gen for dataset synthesis with automated prompt engineering and distribution adjustment, and AIR-Aug for dataset enhancement.

Result: Demonstrates robust image recognition performance and high user satisfaction (4.4/5.0).

Conclusion: AIR effectively automates dataset generation and model training, offering a scalable solution for diverse image recognition tasks.

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) to improve long-range dependency capture in remote sensing change detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based approaches fail to effectively capture long-range dependencies between image channels, limiting feature representation.

Method: Proposes 3D-SSM for global information capture, along with spatiotemporal interaction (SIM) and multi-branch feature extraction (MBFEM) modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The 3D-SSM and its components enhance change detection by integrating global and local features, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

*Weichen Zhang,Dong Xu,Wanli Ouyang,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAN and SPCAN, unsupervised domain adaptation methods combining collaborative and adversarial learning to improve feature representation and target domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain distribution mismatch in unsupervised domain adaptation by learning domain-specific and domain-invariant features.

Method: Uses collaborative learning for domain-specific features and adversarial learning for domain-invariant features, with a self-paced learning strategy (SPCAN) for pseudo-labeled target samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for object and video action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance unsupervised domain adaptation by balancing domain-specific and domain-invariant learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action

TL;DR: AirV2X-Perception is a dataset using UAVs for V2X systems, offering cost-effective and flexible alternatives to fixed infrastructure, with 6.73 hours of diverse driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional V2X systems are costly and create uncovered danger zones in rural/suburban areas. UAVs provide dynamic, cost-effective solutions with better perception.

Method: Leverages UAVs for data collection, offering bird's-eye views and dynamic positioning. Dataset includes urban, suburban, and rural scenarios under varied conditions.

Result: A 6.73-hour dataset enabling development and evaluation of V2D algorithms, addressing gaps in aerial-assisted autonomous driving.

Conclusion: AirV2X-Perception fills a critical need for UAV-assisted V2X systems, with open-sourced data and tools for standardized evaluation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The
dataset and development kits are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaterCaption, a captioning dataset for waterway environments, and Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal model, enhancing global semantic understanding and long-text generation for USVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing waterway perception models lack global semantic understanding, limiting large-scale monitoring. The paper addresses this gap using vision-language models.

Method: Proposes WaterCaption dataset (20.2k image-text pairs) and Da Yu model with Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA) for efficient visual feature modeling.

Result: Da Yu outperforms state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and other benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work advances visual geo-understanding for USVs, enabling better environmental perception and structured log generation.

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoliGS is a deformable Gaussian splatting framework for embodied view synthesis from long monocular videos, outperforming dynamic NeRFs in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods like 4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRFs face high training overhead for long captures. HoliGS aims to address this by accurately reconstructing large-scale, dynamic environments.

Method: Decomposes scenes into static backgrounds and time-varying objects using Gaussian primitives with global rigid, skeleton-driven, and non-rigid deformations via invertible neural flow.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and reduces training/rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs.

Conclusion: HoliGS offers a practical, scalable solution for embodied view synthesis in real-world scenarios, with plans to release source code.

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VLM-guided cascaded framework for Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS), addressing domain gaps and segmentation challenges by leveraging SAM and VLM-derived features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing two-stage methods in OVCOS, which suffer from domain gaps and ineffective segmentation for camouflaged objects.

Method: A novel framework using VLM-guided SAM for segmentation and soft spatial priors for classification, retaining full image context.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on OVCOS and conventional benchmarks, improving localization and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages VLM semantics for precise segmentation and context-aware classification of camouflaged objects.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using human gaze data and video recordings improves the assessment of endotracheal intubation skills, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subjective evaluations of airway management skills lack objectivity and fail to reflect real-world competency, especially in high-stress scenarios like emergency medicine.

Method: The system uses gaze data to create visual masks, guiding an autoencoder and attention module to classify successful and unsuccessful intubation procedures.

Result: The method enhances accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness, offering a robust tool for clinical skill assessment.

Conclusion: This approach has significant potential to improve clinical training and patient outcomes in emergency settings.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained alignments between point clouds and text due to reliance on simple cosine similarity, limiting performance.

Method: Introduces LM-AD and the Affordance Query Module (AQM), leveraging a pretrained language model for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: LM-AD and AQM effectively address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point clouds, improving performance over current methods.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes PMC, a multi-modality domain adaptation framework for transferring knowledge from source to target domains using RGB and depth modalities, with extensions for missing modalities (PMC-PI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of domain adaptation in multi-modality settings (MMDA and MMDA-PI) by leveraging multiple modalities for reliable knowledge transfer.

Method: Introduces PMC with two modules for modality cooperation and PMC-PI with a multi-modality data generation (MMG) network for missing modalities. Uses adversarial learning and pseudo semantics.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on three image and eight video datasets for cross-domain visual recognition tasks.

Conclusion: PMC and PMC-PI effectively handle multi-modality domain adaptation, even with missing modalities, improving cross-domain recognition.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

TL;DR: RetCoP is a continual vision-language pre-training framework for fundus images, integrating multiple modalities incrementally while mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore modality complementarity, and existing foundation models are modality-specific. RetCoP addresses the need for a unified model in dynamic environments.

Method: RetCoP uses rehearsal with representative image-text pairs and off-diagonal information distillation to preserve knowledge and alignment.

Result: RetCoP outperforms other methods, showing the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate.

Conclusion: RetCoP successfully integrates multiple fundus modalities incrementally, offering a versatile and robust solution.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

TL;DR: A multimodal survival prediction framework using hypergraph learning to integrate pathology slides and genomics data, addressing modality imbalance and incomplete data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on FFPE slides and genomics, ignoring other slide types like FF, and struggle with modality imbalance and incomplete data.

Method: Proposes a hypergraph learning framework for multimodal fusion and introduces a memory mechanism to handle incomplete modalities.

Result: Outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index; surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models (7.9%) in incomplete modality scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates pathology and genomic data, addressing modality imbalance and improving survival prediction, even with incomplete data.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

Abstract: This paper aims to achieve the segmentation of any 3D part in a scene based
on natural language descriptions, extending beyond traditional object-level 3D

to the expensive acquisition and annotation burden, existing datasets and

Result: The model achieves accurate segmentation, robustness to noise, and outperforms classical edge-based methods in experiments on medical and synthetic images.

Conclusion: The Chan-Vese model is highly suitable for complex segmentation tasks and holds promise for real-world imaging applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the

intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite

to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.

TL;DR: MotionEcho is a training-free framework for motion customization in distilled video generation models, using teacher forcing to improve motion fidelity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilled video models struggle with motion customization under training-free settings, as existing methods fail to adapt to their accelerated generative process.

Method: MotionEcho leverages diffusion teacher forcing, using slow teacher models to guide fast student models via endpoint prediction and interpolation, with dynamic computation allocation.

Result: The method significantly enhances motion fidelity and generation quality while maintaining efficiency, validated across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: MotionEcho effectively addresses motion customization challenges in distilled video generation without additional training.

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for tissue deformation recovery from stereo endoscopic images, addressing issues like occlusion and camera motion, using 3D point and derivative maps for geometry and deformation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve surgical navigation and autonomous soft tissue manipulation by overcoming limitations of previous methods, such as reliance on offline processing and lack of biomechanical priors.

Method: Models tissue geometry as 3D point and derivative maps and deformation as 3D displacement and local deformation maps. Uses 6 parameters for rigid motion and 3 for local deformation per point, optimizing inter-frame deformation without camera pose estimation.

Result: Achieves 3D reconstruction accuracy of 0.37±0.27 mm (non-occluded) and 0.39±0.21 mm (occluded) surface distance, and estimates surface strain distribution.

Conclusion: The method effectively models tissue geometry and deformation in real-time, even under occlusion, enhancing surgical analysis and navigation.

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Motivation: To understand how text recognition in images develops during VLM training and identify its distinct learning pattern compared to semantic understanding.

Method: Analyzed the emergence of text readability and semantic understanding in VLMs during training, focusing on contrastive learning dynamics.

emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

*Declan J. Curran,Sanaa Hobeichi,Hira Saleem,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD), a lightweight AI model for high-resolution climate data generation, reducing computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional downscaling methods are computationally intensive, and existing AI models, though effective, remain resource-heavy. HDD aims to address this by offering a more efficient solution.

Method: HDD employs a hierarchical sampling process within a diffusion framework, using a coarse-to-fine downsampling scheme to reduce computational load.

Result: HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 and CMIP6 datasets, reduces computational load by half, and transfers seamlessly across resolutions.

Conclusion: HDD provides a lightweight, efficient alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, enabling affordable high-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

TL;DR: GLCANet is a lightweight segmentation framework for UHR remote sensing imagery, addressing computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation in UHR remote sensing has grown, but existing methods struggle with computational efficiency and feature fusion.

Method: GLCANet uses a dual-stream architecture with self-attention and masked cross-attention mechanisms to fuse global semantics and local details efficiently.

Result: GLCANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency, processing high-resolution images with minimal GPU usage.

Conclusion: GLCANet offers a promising solution for real-world remote sensing applications by balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

*Yin Zhang,Zian Ning,Xiaoyu Zhang,Shiliang Guo,Peidong Liu,Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for detecting micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using event cameras by focusing on propeller features in event streams, outperforming RGB-based methods without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV detection methods rely on RGB images, which lack generalized detection due to diverse appearances. Event cameras capture propeller features better.

Method: The method uses three modules to extract propeller features from event streams while filtering noise. A novel event-based MAV dataset is introduced.

Result: The method achieves 83.0% precision (+30.3%) and 81.5% recall (+36.4%) on the new dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Event-based detection of MAVs is effective, and the introduced dataset supports further research in this area.

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

*Lixuan He,Haoyu Dong,Zhenxing Chen,Yangcheng Yu,Jie Feng,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mem4Nav enhances VLN with hierarchical spatial-cognition memory, improving navigation performance by 7-13 pp in Task Completion and >10 pp nDTW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of modular pipelines (lack unified memory) and end-to-end agents (fixed context windows, implicit spatial reasoning) in VLN.

Method: Introduces Mem4Nav, a hierarchical memory system combining sparse octree for fine-grained indexing and semantic topology graph for landmark connectivity, with trainable memory tokens.

Result: 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, reduced SPD, and >10 pp nDTW improvement across three backbones.

Conclusion: Mem4Nav's hierarchical map and dual memory modules are essential for improved VLN performance.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

*Congjing Yu,Jing Ye,Yang Liu,Xiaodong Zhang,Zhiyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMF-MedIT is a framework for integrating medical image and tabular data, addressing cross-modal discrepancies and noise. It uses an Adaptive Modulation and Fusion module and a tabular encoder (FT-Mamba) for efficient fusion and noise handling, achieving strong performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in multimodal medical analysis include cross-modal discrepancies, modality contribution imbalance, and noise in tabular data, especially under data-scarce conditions.

Method: Proposes AMF-MedIT with an AMF module for adaptive modulation and fusion, and FT-Mamba for tabular data encoding. Includes feature masks, density/leakage losses, and interpretability studies.

Result: AMF-MedIT achieves superior multimodal performance and data efficiency, with strong adaptability to incomplete tabular data. FT-Mamba excels in feature extraction and guiding image attention.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fusion challenges, offering a balanced, efficient, and interpretable solution for multimodal medical analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

### [50] [Sampling Matters in Explanations: Towards Trustworthy Attribution Analysis Building Block in Visual Models through Maximizing Explanation Certainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19442)
*Róisín Luo,James McDermott,Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-optimal sampling approach for image attribution analysis by suppressing features, improving explanation certainty by aligning sample distribution with natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior gradient integration methods use noisy samples, leading to low explanation certainty. The paper aims to address this misalignment.

Method: A semi-optimal sampling approach suppresses input features to align sample distribution with natural images, avoiding noise addition.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ImageNet, providing more trustworthy explanations.

Conclusion: Feature suppression aligns sample distribution with natural images, enhancing attribution analysis reliability.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with

degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our
dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and
generalizable deblurring models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-step method to improve synthetic data for training deep learning models, reducing the performance gap with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real image datasets are hard to curate and pose privacy/legal issues, while existing synthetic data underperforms.

Method: 1. Improved neural fractal formulation for synthetic data. 2. Reverse stylization to transfer features from real images.

Result: Lower distributional gap (KID), 11% FID reduction, 20% autoencoder error decrease, 10% ImageNet-100 accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The method enables practical model training without large real datasets, showing significant performance gains.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Motivation: Existing Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning and interpretability, limiting their clinical reliability and development potential.

Method: The authors build the Surgery-R1-54k dataset and propose Surgery-R1, a Reasoning MLLM with a two-stage fine-tuning mechanism (SFT and RFT) and a Multimodal Coherence reward system.

Result: Surgery-R1 outperforms existing SOTA models and MLLMs in Surgical-VQLA, demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances reasoning and interpretability in Surgical-VQLA, with potential for clinical applications. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments are dynamic and data-scarce, making USIS underexplored. The lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets hinders progress in this field.

Method: The authors created USIS16K, a dataset with 16,151 high-resolution underwater images and 158 object categories, annotated with instance-level masks. Benchmark evaluations for object detection and USIS tasks were conducted.

Result: USIS16K offers diversity, complexity, and scalability, advancing research in underwater salient instance segmentation. Benchmark models and evaluations are provided.

Conclusion: USIS16K is a significant contribution to underwater vision research, enabling future studies with its publicly available dataset and benchmarks.

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and

TL;DR: HMSViT, a Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer, improves DPN diagnosis via efficient corneal nerve segmentation, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is crucial, but current automated methods using Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) face inefficiencies in feature extraction and data limitations.

Method: HMSViT combines hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding for multi-scale feature extraction. It uses block-masked self-supervised learning to reduce reliance on labeled data and a multi-scale decoder for segmentation and classification.

Result: HMSViT achieves 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming models like Swin Transformer and HiViT by up to 6.39% with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: HMSViT offers robust, clinically viable results, demonstrating potential for real-world DPN diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

TL;DR: SceneCrafter is a tool for realistic 3D-consistent editing of driving scenes, addressing challenges like cross-camera consistency and empty street priors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely synthetic scenes lack realism and grounding in reality, while editing real driving logs presents challenges like 3D consistency and paired data generation.

Method: Leverages multi-view diffusion models for controllable editing, uses Prompt-to-Prompt for paired data, and employs alpha-blending for local edits.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality.

Conclusion: SceneCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in driving scene simulation, offering superior editing capabilities.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark (PRE-HAL) to evaluate visual hallucinations in LVLMs, focusing on both perception and reasoning. It proposes a DST-based detection method, showing improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability gap in LVLMs caused by visual hallucinations, especially in safety-critical AI applications, by evaluating and detecting such discrepancies.

Method: Develop the PRE-HAL dataset for systematic evaluation and propose a DST-based detection method using uncertainty estimation to identify conflicts in high-level features.

Result: The method outperforms baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs.

Conclusion: The PRE-HAL benchmark and DST-based detection method effectively address visual hallucinations in LVLMs, enhancing reliability for critical applications.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our

TL;DR: A deep learning framework, ReMAR-DS, reduces metal artifacts in kVCT images and transforms them into MVCT-like images, improving radiotherapy planning and reducing patient radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in kVCT degrade image quality, affecting clinical decisions. The goal is to reduce artifacts and bridge the gap between kVCT and MVCT for better radiotherapy planning.

Method: ReMAR-DS uses an encoder-decoder architecture with feature recalibration to focus on artifact regions and preserve anatomical structures, transforming kVCT to MVCT-like images.

Result: The framework produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, reducing the need for repeated MVCT scans.

Conclusion: ReMAR-DS enhances radiotherapy planning by enabling reliance on kVCT alone, lowering radiation exposure for patients.

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

*Ankita Raj,Ambar Pal,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect and identify natural-looking backdoor triggers in face recognition systems, achieving 74% top-5 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in face recognition systems, using natural triggers like sunglasses, pose security threats, necessitating detection and mitigation techniques.

Method: A novel technique to detect compromised networks and identify natural triggers, tested on a backdoored FR system.

Result: The method achieves 74% top-5 accuracy in identifying triggers, outperforming a naive baseline (56%).

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively detects and identifies backdoor triggers, enhancing security for FR systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretraining custom foundation models on medical data outperforms transfer-learning from generalist models, even with smaller datasets. Established methods like DINOv2 work well without novel adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether custom pretraining on medical data is better than transfer-learning from generalist models and if novel methods are needed.

Method: Case-study using DINOv2 to pretrain a model on 2M fetal ultrasound images, comparing it against models pretrained on natural/ultrasound images and supervised baselines.

Result: Custom pretraining achieves state-of-the-art results on fetal ultrasound tasks, showing better performance than scaling natural image pretraining.

Conclusion: Custom pretraining is effective for medical domains, and methodological innovation is unnecessary under common resource constraints.

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

*Minjong Cheon,Changbae Mun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaOutRS introduces a hybrid CNN architecture with a Fourier Filter Gate for efficient remote sensing image classification, outperforming SSMs and transformers with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of adapting State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba to 2D visual data by proposing a simpler, more effective solution.

Method: Uses stacked Gated CNN blocks for local features and a Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) for global context, evaluated on remote sensing datasets.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance, e.g., 98.41% F1-score on UC Merced, outperforming larger models.

Conclusion: MambaOutRS offers an efficient alternative to SSMs, combining gated convolutions and frequency-based gates for robust classification.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

### [62] [Recurrent Visual Feature Extraction and Stereo Attentions for CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19665)
*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel LLM-based method for CT report generation, leveraging recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions to improve alignment between CT slices and text, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CT report generation fail to account for transformations among CT slices and lack effective integration of multi-level image features, especially for organ lesions.

Method: The method uses a vision Transformer to recurrently process CT slices, employs stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling, and aligns visual and textual features to instruct an LLM.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the M3D-Cap dataset, surpassing strong baselines.

Conclusion: The approach is validated as effective for CT report generation, demonstrating improved feature alignment and hierarchical modeling.

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARTIES is a foundation model for multi-sensor remote sensing, enabling flexible processing of diverse sensors without re-training or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models are limited to single or fixed sensor combinations, hindering scalability and generalization in remote sensing.

Method: SMARTIES projects data from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space and uses a unified transformer model with cross-sensor token mixup for reconstruction.

Result: SMARTIES outperforms sensor-specific models in both single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors.

Conclusion: SMARTIES offers a scalable, sensor-agnostic solution for multi-sensor remote sensing, improving flexibility and performance.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Vision Transformer (ViT) reconstructs cloud-covered MSI data by combining time-series MSI and SAR, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in MSI disrupts early crop mapping; SAR data lacks spectral detail. Combining both addresses these limitations.

Method: Proposes Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using ViT, leveraging temporal coherence of MSI and SAR's complementary data via attention.

Result: Outperforms baselines (non-time-series MSI/SAR or time-series MSI alone) in reconstructing cloud-covered MSI.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered areas, aiding crop mapping.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs by eliminating the need for 3D labels and improving efficiency.

Method: Uses heuristic-based image pixel sampling for efficient training and a Double Gradient mask to preserve LiDAR features.

Result: Achieves best performance on LiDAR and Camera domains in the KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: NVSF is a scalable, self-supervised solution for dynamic scene representation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera

Conclusion: VideoPCDNet effectively enables unsupervised object tracking and prediction with interpretable representations, advancing video content understanding.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition

recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of

TL;DR: HOIverse is a synthetic dataset for scene understanding, focusing on human-object interactions with detailed ground truths, aiming to advance research in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets lack reliable data for scene understanding in indoor environments with humans, necessitating a structured representation like scene graphs.

Method: HOIverse provides RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images, and human keypoints, with parametric relations between humans and objects.

Result: The dataset benchmarks state-of-the-art scene graph models for predicting human-object interactions and parametric relations.

Conclusion: HOIverse aims to accelerate research in scene understanding involving humans by providing accurate and dense relationship data.

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms in VLMs have quadratic complexity, limiting their application to long video understanding.

Method: PEVLM partitions input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions.

Result: PEVLM achieves up to 8.37% accuracy improvement, 7.47x speedup in attention computation, and 40% reduction in end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: PEVLM is effective for low-latency, long-context video understanding, suitable for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

TL;DR: xarrayvideo is a Python library for compressing large-scale Earth system datasets by encoding them as videos, achieving high compression ratios (up to 250x) without quality loss, demonstrated on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of Earth observation datasets necessitates efficient compression techniques to manage storage and processing demands while maintaining data fidelity.

Method: The library leverages standard video codecs (via ffmpeg) to exploit spatial, temporal, and spectral redundancies in multichannel spatiotemporal datasets.

Result: Achieved compression ratios up to 250x with high PSNR values (e.g., 55.86 dB at 0.1 bpppb) and no performance loss in downstream tasks like landcover segmentation.

Conclusion: xarrayvideo provides an efficient, accessible solution for compressing Earth observation datasets, making them more manageable for the Earth science community.

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Yuheng Bu,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP improves medical image segmentation by automating prompts and addressing domain shift, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's reliance on manual prompts and domain shift issues limit its effectiveness in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposed SAM2-SGP with Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) and Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) modules, plus low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for domain shift.

Result: Outperformed nnUNet, SwinUNet, SAM2, and MedSAM2 across multiple medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP is effective for medical image segmentation, eliminating manual prompts and mitigating domain shift.

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ScaleCap is an inference-time scalable image captioning method that addresses biases in LVLMs by progressively enriching captions with heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating, improving accuracy and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle biases in LVLMs—multimodal bias causing imbalanced granularity and linguistic bias leading to hallucinations—to generate more comprehensive and accurate image captions.

Method: ScaleCap uses heuristic question answering to inject relevant information and contrastive sentence rating to eliminate hallucinations, progressively improving captions with increased inference budget.

Result: ScaleCap enhances caption quality, validated by modality alignment experiments and performance gains on 11 benchmarks. It also excels in VQA and image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleCap effectively addresses LVLM biases, producing richer and more accurate captions, with demonstrated improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision oncology needs cost-effective molecular insights, but current methods are limited in predicting complex features from WSIs.

Method: PathLUPI leverages transcriptomic privileged information to create genome-anchored histological embeddings for molecular prediction using WSIs.

Result: Achieves AUC ≥ 0.80 in 14 tasks and C-index ≥ 0.70 in survival cohorts, revealing cellular morphological signatures linked to genotypes.

Conclusion: PathLUPI bridges molecular insights with routine pathology, overcoming limitations of existing models for clinical use.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

### [74] [Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19683)
*Xuesong Li,Dianye Huang,Yameng Zhang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scene graph (SG) method for ultrasound images to improve interpretability and scanning guidance for non-experts, validated on neck region images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of medical ultrasound variability and the unmet need for interpretability and guidance for non-expert users, especially in point-of-care settings.

Method: Uses a transformer-based one-stage method to compute ultrasound SGs, refined by LLMs for user queries, and explores SGs for scanning guidance.

Result: Validated on neck region images, showing potential to democratize ultrasound by enhancing interpretability and usability for non-experts.

Conclusion: The SG-based approach effectively improves ultrasound interpretability and scanning guidance for ordinary users.

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

*Yue Zhou,Yuan Bi,Wenjuan Tong,Wei Wang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraAD, a vision-language model, improves anomaly detection in ultrasound images by leveraging few-shot examples for localization and fine-grained classification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of fine-grained differentiation in anomaly detection and domain gaps in ultrasound imaging due to device and parameter variations.

Method: Uses a vision-language model with fused image-level and text embeddings for localization and a memory bank of few-shot examples for fine-grained classification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lesion localization and fine-grained classification on breast US datasets.

Conclusion: UltraAD effectively addresses domain gaps and improves anomaly detection in medical imaging, with potential for clinical use.

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

*Stephanie Käs,Sven Peter,Henrik Thillmann,Anton Burenko,David Benjamin Adrian,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates projection methods for fisheye images to improve 3D human pose estimation, finding advanced models like the double sphere model most effective, and introduces a new dataset, FISHnCHIPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate human pose detection in fisheye images is challenging due to distortions, and existing methods lack systematic evaluation for wide-FOV poses.

Method: Evaluated pinhole, equidistant, double sphere models, and cylindrical projections for 3D pose estimation, proposing a heuristic for model selection.

Result: Pinhole projection fails in close-ups; optimal method varies with FOV. Double sphere model significantly improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Advanced fisheye models enhance pose estimation; the proposed heuristic and FISHnCHIPS dataset support better predictions.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo4D is a framework for generating detailed, multi-view consistent 4D scenes from text prompts, optionally with images, by separating foreground and background synthesis guided by motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D synthesis methods lack multi-view consistency and immersive dynamic scenes, limiting their practicality.

Method: CoCo4D divides synthesis into dynamic foreground and evolving background, guided by motion sequences. It uses video diffusion models for initial motion and a progressive outpainting scheme for synthesis.

Result: CoCo4D outperforms existing methods in 4D scene generation, achieving realistic and coherent blending.

Conclusion: CoCo4D effectively addresses limitations of current 4D synthesis methods, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on
our website https://colezwhy.github.io/coco4d/.

### [78] [One Prototype Is Enough: Single-Prototype Activation for Interpretable Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19808)
*Yitao Peng,Lianghua He,Die Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoSolo is a deep neural architecture for interpretable image classification using a single prototype per category, reducing cognitive complexity and leveraging feature maps for richer global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype networks rely on multiple prototypes for classification, complicating explanations. ProtoSolo simplifies this by using a single prototype.

Method: ProtoSolo uses a single prototype activation, feature-based comparison with feature maps, and a non-prototype projection learning strategy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets, achieving superior classification and simpler explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSolo offers a simpler, more interpretable approach to image classification with competitive performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

*Yubo Huang,Weiqiang Wang,Sirui Zhao,Tong Xu,Lin Liu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bind-Your-Avatar, a model for generating multi-talking-character videos in the same scene, addressing audio-to-character correspondence and dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-character scenarios or separate conversations, leaving multi-character, co-present video generation unexplored.

Method: Proposes an MM-DiT-based model with an Embedding Router for audio-character binding, 3D-mask embedding for fine-grained control, and introduces a new dataset and benchmark.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated over state-of-the-art methods in dual-talking-character video generation.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses key challenges in multi-character video generation, offering a novel framework and dataset.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

*Liangbin Xie,Yu Li,Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Xintao Wang,Fanghua Yu,Ziyan Chen,Pengfei Wan,Jiantao Zhou,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage video generation framework using latent diffusion models, focusing on cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) to enhance resolution efficiently. It introduces degradation strategies, analyzes VSR behavior, and presents architectural innovations for reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User demand for higher-resolution video outputs makes latent computation alone insufficient. A two-stage approach (semantic generation + detail synthesis) is explored, with emphasis on improving cascaded VSR models.

Method: 1. Proposes degradation strategies for aligned VSR training. 2. Analyzes timestep sampling and noise augmentation effects. 3. Introduces interleaving temporal units and sparse local attention for efficiency.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies validating design choices. It reduces computational overhead while achieving high-resolution outputs.

Conclusion: The work establishes a baseline for cascaded VSR, offering practical insights for future efficient video synthesis systems.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

*Moayed Haji-Ali,Willi Menapace,Ivan Skorokhodov,Arpit Sahni,Sergey Tulyakov,Vicente Ordonez,Aliaksandr Siarohin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFM is a simple, effective framework for progressive visual generation using Flow Matching at multi-scale levels, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional visual generation is computationally intensive, and existing multi-stage approaches add complexity. DFM aims to simplify this while improving results.

Method: DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a multi-scale representation (e.g., Laplacian pyramid) for progressive generation.

Result: DFM improves visual quality for images/videos, achieving 35.2% FDD score improvement on Imagenet-1k 512px and faster convergence for large models like FLUX.

Conclusion: DFM offers superior performance, simplicity, and minimal pipeline modifications, making it a practical solution for progressive visual generation.

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenHSI is a training-free method for generating long human-scene interaction videos by subdividing the task into script writing, pre-visualization, and animation stages, ensuring identity preservation and rich interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models struggle with generating long, realistic human-scene interaction videos due to unrealistic interactions, identity loss, and high training costs.

Method: GenHSI divides the task into three stages: script writing (breaking tasks into atomic actions), pre-visualization (creating 3D keyframes), and animation (using diffusion models). It works with single-view images and avoids expensive training.

Result: The method generates long videos with consistent camera poses, preserved character identity, and plausible human-scene interactions from a single image.

Conclusion: GenHSI effectively addresses limitations of prior work, offering a scalable, training-free solution for realistic long-video generation.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction as a 2D image quality assessment task, using a cross-reference IQA framework for faster, representation-agnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view selection require specialized designs for 3D representations and complex 3D modeling, limiting flexibility and efficiency.

Method: The approach trains a model to predict SSIM in a multi-view setup, using it to guide view selection based on rendering quality.

Result: The method achieves significant improvements in benchmarks, runs 14-33 times faster, and is agnostic to 3D representations.

Conclusion: The cross-reference IQA framework offers a simpler, faster, and more versatile solution for active view selection.

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

TL;DR: UniVLA is a unified vision-language-action model that autoregressively models multimodal signals as token sequences, excelling in long-horizon tasks and setting new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VLAs rely on VLMs for action signals, missing temporal and causal structures in visual data. UniVLA addresses this gap.

Method: UniVLA models vision, language, and action as discrete token sequences, incorporating world modeling for causal dynamics.

Result: Achieves 95.5% success on LIBERO, surpassing prior methods (e.g., pi0-FAST's 85.5%), and excels in real-world tasks like ALOHA and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: UniVLA's unified approach and world modeling enable superior performance in robotic manipulation and autonomous tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: AnimaX is a 3D animation framework that combines video diffusion models with skeleton-based animation, enabling diverse articulated mesh animation without costly optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion synthesis methods are limited by fixed skeletal topologies or high-dimensional optimization, prompting the need for a scalable, efficient solution.

Method: AnimaX represents 3D motion as 2D pose maps, uses joint video-pose diffusion, and ensures alignment via shared encodings. It triangulates multi-view poses into 3D joint positions and converts them into mesh animation.

Result: AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art performance on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, trained on 160,000 rigged sequences.

Conclusion: AnimaX offers a scalable, category-agnostic solution for 3D animation by effectively transferring video priors to motion generation.

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism for video diffusion models, reducing computational costs while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational costs of video diffusion models due to the temporal dimension, and the observed Spatiotemporal Energy Decay phenomenon, inspired the development of Radial Attention.

Method: Radial Attention uses a static attention mask with exponentially decaying compute density, focusing on spatially nearby tokens with shrinking attention window size over temporal distance.

Result: Radial Attention achieves up to 1.9× speedup, reduces training costs by 4.4×, and enables 4× longer video generation with minimal tuning.

Conclusion: Radial Attention is an efficient and scalable solution for video diffusion models, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

### [88] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous agents in tribes use communication signals to coordinate and improve collective efficiency, developing a shared culture through learning and signaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous agents self-organize into cultures and how communication strategies affect their cooperation and performance.

Method: Using the NEC-DAC system with neural network-equipped agents, analyzing social structures like authority hierarchies and communication strategies.

Result: Culture of cooperation significantly impacts tribe performance, and signals facilitate culture emergence and transmission across generations.

Conclusion: Coordinated behavior and signaling within neural networks enhance collective efficiency and cultural transmission among agents.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [89] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic randomization in LLMs using a zero-sum game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, evaluating five LLMs to isolate decision-making from randomness generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic randomization is underexplored in LLMs, and prior work conflates cognitive decisions with mechanical randomness generation.

Method: A novel zero-sum game with Nash equilibrium as maximal entropy strategy is used. Five LLMs are evaluated across framed, neutral, and hinted prompts.

Result: Weaker models remain deterministic; stronger models randomize more with hints. Strong LLMs exploit weaker models but converge to equilibrium with peers.

Conclusion: LLMs show varied strategic reasoning, highlighting gaps in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. The implementation is open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [90] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s (2025) claim of a reasoning cliff in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), arguing it's due to experimental constraints, not fundamental limitations. It demonstrates improved performance with agentic tools, suggesting the issue is execution, not reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conclusion that LRMs have intrinsic reasoning limitations by identifying experimental artifacts and proposing an agentic gap as the real issue.

Method: Empirically refutes the reasoning cliff claim by enabling models with agentic tools, solving problems beyond the previously observed complexity threshold. Analyzes tool-enabled models to show a hierarchy of reasoning capabilities.

Result: Demonstrates that LRMs, when equipped with tools, solve problems far beyond the reasoning cliff, revealing a hierarchy of agentic reasoning.

Conclusion: The perceived reasoning deficit in LRMs is due to restrictive interfaces, not cognitive limitations. Agentic tools enable models to overcome execution barriers, redefining machine intelligence measurement.

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN, a foundation model for tabular data, is applied to sub-national yield forecasting in South Africa, showing comparable accuracy to ML models but with faster tuning and less feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of TabPFN in yield forecasting using EO and weather data, comparing it with traditional ML models and baselines.

Method: Used dekadal EO and weather data, aggregated monthly, to forecast crop yields. Benchmarked TabPFN against six ML models and three baselines using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.

Result: TabPFN and ML models had comparable accuracy, outperforming baselines. TabPFN offered faster tuning and less feature engineering.

Conclusion: TabPFN is more practical for real-world yield forecasting due to its efficiency and ease of implementation.

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to play Baba is You, a puzzle game requiring language and reasoning. Larger models like GPT-4o perform better, while smaller ones struggle. Finetuning helps analyze levels but not solve puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning and language skills in dynamic rule-based games like Baba is You.

Method: Six LLMs were tested with three prompt types, and two models (Mistral, OLMo) were finetuned using game data.

Result: Larger models performed better, but all struggled with dynamic rule changes. Finetuning improved level analysis but not solution formulation.

Conclusion: LLMs, even state-of-the-art ones, struggle with dynamic rule reasoning, highlighting challenges in complex problem-solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [93] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GITes, a framework combining spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita with GPT-4o to improve emotional support, showing significant improvements in NLP and spiritual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mental health support lacks depth in addressing emotional needs. Integrating spiritual wisdom with AI aims to enhance emotional well-being.

Method: The study extends the ExTES dataset with spiritually guided responses (GITes), benchmarks 12 LLMs, and introduces a Spiritual Insight metric for evaluation.

Result: Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct showed improvements: 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score, and 15.92% in Spiritual Insight.

Conclusion: AI enriched with spiritual guidance has strong potential to improve user satisfaction, though real-world validation is needed.

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for AI systems with probabilistic agents using Bayesian inference, competition, and belief revision to evolve toward truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a mathematically rigorous AI system where agents evolve through competition and belief updates, aligning with an external oracle representing truth.

Method: Uses Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics. Agents compete, update beliefs, and reproduce based on alignment with truth. Cryptographic identities and causal inference ensure traceability and robustness.

Result: Formal theorems prove convergence, robustness, and evolutionary stability, showing truth as an attractor in the system.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates how adversarial pressure in a computable swarm can produce verifiable knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [95] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GBGC is a multi-granularity graph coarsening method using granular-ball computing for efficient and adaptive coarsening, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph coarsening methods focus on spectrum-preserving but ignore multi-granularity subregions, leading to suboptimal results. GBGC addresses this by leveraging granular-ball computing.

Method: GBGC adaptively splits the graph into granular-balls of optimal granularity, using them as supernodes to construct the coarsened graph.

Result: GBGC improves coarsening efficiency (10-100x faster) and accuracy, often outperforming the original graph due to robustness.

Conclusion: GBGC is a promising standard for graph preprocessing, combining efficiency, adaptability, and superior results.

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1 is a recommendation framework using LLMs and GRPO to improve accuracy, diversity, and business alignment, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses filter bubbles, underutilized knowledge, and misalignment between model optimization and business policies.

Method: Uses LLM-interpretable prompts, SFT for basic recommendations, and GRPO with CoT for multi-objective optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, diversity, and novelty on real-world social media data.

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1 mitigates filter bubbles and aligns recommendations with complex business goals.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating emotion detection into calendar apps using biometric (ECG signals) and behavioral (computer activity) methods, finding the latter more consistent and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance productivity and engagement in HCI by dynamically adapting interfaces to users' emotional states.

Method: Two approaches: biometric (ECG signals processed via LSTM/GRU) and behavioral (machine learning on user interactions).

Result: Behavioral method (90% accuracy for mouse interactions) outperformed biometric (GRU: 84.38% for Valence).

Conclusion: Computer activity-based emotion detection is more effective, with GRU slightly better than LSTM in biometric analysis.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated data-curation pipeline for software engineering (SWE) datasets, scaling volume and diversity. The Skywork-SWE model, trained on this dataset, shows continuous performance improvement with data size, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data curation in SWE is time-consuming, limiting dataset size and diversity. The goal is to automate this process to enable larger, more diverse datasets for better LLM performance.

Method: Proposes an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline for SWE datasets, including real-world Python tasks with natural language descriptions and runtime environments. Fine-tunes the Skywork-SWE model on this data.

Result: The model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on SWE-bench without verifiers, improving to 47.0% with test-time scaling, surpassing previous SOTA for sub-32B models.

Conclusion: Automated data curation and scaling improve LLM performance in SWE, with the Skywork-SWE model setting new benchmarks. The model checkpoint is released for future research.

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT is a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback in English education, using three datasets (DM, DG, DA) to balance quality and cost. Adding a small portion of high-quality data (DM) to lower-quality data (DG) improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based tutoring systems need high-quality teacher feedback data, which is costly to produce manually. FEAT aims to reduce costs while maintaining quality.

Method: FEAT uses three datasets: DM (human-LLM collaboration, high cost/quality), DG (LLM-only, low cost/quality), and DA (DG augmented with DM for balance).

Result: Adding 5-10% DM to DG outperforms using 100% DM alone, showing cost-efficiency without sacrificing quality.

Conclusion: FEAT provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for generating teacher feedback, leveraging hybrid data approaches.

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

*Debosmita Bhaumik,Julian Togelius,Georgios N. Yannakakis,Ahmed Khalifa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a search-based method for repairing non-functional game levels, combining evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, and integrates it with PCGML for hybrid procedural content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game levels designed or generated often lack functionality (e.g., incompleteness, unreachable objects). Repairing them manually is tedious, and constrained changes are needed.

Method: Uses evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms for search-based level repair, applied to levels generated by PCGML.

Result: The hybrid approach (PCGML + search-based repair) effectively fixes broken levels while maintaining stylistic appropriateness.

Conclusion: The combination of PCGML and search-based repair is promising for hybrid procedural content generation, ensuring functional and stylistically coherent game levels.

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG improves multi-turn dialogue systems by combining intent-based graph traversal with semantic search, outperforming traditional methods in coherence and goal progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing dialogue systems in maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in customer service conversations.

Method: Constructs dynamic intent transition graphs and uses a dual-retrieval mechanism to balance intent-based traversal and semantic search.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 11% BLEU, 5% ROUGE-L, 6% METEOR, and 58% response quality improvements.

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG effectively integrates intent and semantic retrieval for better performance in knowledge-intensive dialogues.

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

Motivation: To assess OCR's potential beyond scene decomposition, focusing on reasoning and generalization in multi-object robotic tasks.

Method: Created simulated robotic tasks with multiple objects and high randomization, comparing OCR against holistic representations.

Result: OCR outperforms holistic methods in complex scenarios, demonstrating robustness to scene variations.

Conclusion: OCR is promising for robotic manipulation, especially in challenging, varied environments.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

*Yazhou Zhang,Chunwang Zou,Bo Wang,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commander-GPT, a modular framework using specialized LLM agents and centralized commanders, improves sarcasm understanding, outperforming SoTA by 4.4-11.7% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sarcasm understanding despite strong performance in other NLP tasks, prompting the need for a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes Commander-GPT, orchestrating specialized LLM agents for sub-tasks (e.g., context modeling, sentiment analysis) and integrating outputs via centralized commanders (lightweight encoders, small autoregressive models, or large LLMs).

Result: Achieves 4.4% and 11.7% F1 score improvements over SoTA on MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Commander-GPT effectively enhances sarcasm understanding by leveraging modular decision routing and specialized agents.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional RAG (retrieval drift, redundancy, rigidity) in complex reasoning tasks.

### [106] [NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Dependency Graphs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500)
*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent introduces a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling in LLMs, outperforming baselines in task success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of static knowledge and fragile tool invocation in LLMs, which hinder complex toolchain orchestration.

Method: Uses a Multi-Path Decider for dynamic action selection and a Graph-Encoded Navigator with a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG) for efficient toolchain planning.

Result: Achieves higher task success rates (TSR) than baselines, with execution steps close to the most efficient baseline. Fine-tuned models show significant improvements.

Conclusion: NaviAgent balances quality and efficiency, proving essential for robust toolchain orchestration, especially in complex tasks.

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

*Carlo Romeo,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NTRL automates D&D combat encounter balancing using reinforcement learning, improving combat longevity and strategic depth while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual D&D encounter balancing is complex and disrupts narrative flow; NTRL automates this for dynamic difficulty adjustment.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning (contextual bandit) to generate encounters based on real-time party attributes.

Result: Increases combat longevity (+200%), reduces post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and enhances tactical play with high win rates (70%).

Conclusion: NTRL outperforms human DMs by optimizing encounters for strategic depth and fairness.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

*Sanne Wielinga,Jesse Heyninck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining ASP-derived rules (FOLD-R++) with black-box ML classifiers improves accuracy and interpretability in healthcare predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing ML models lack interpretability, while symbolic methods like ASP lack predictive power. A hybrid solution is needed.

Method: Integrates ASP-derived rules from FOLD-R++ with ML classifiers to correct uncertain predictions and provide explanations.

Result: Experiments on five medical datasets show significant gains in accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with ML achieves interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TAPAS is a multi-agent framework combining LLMs and symbolic planning to solve tasks without manual environment models, using collaborative agents for dynamic adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving complex tasks without manually defined environment models by leveraging LLMs and multi-agent collaboration.

Method: TAPAS uses specialized LLM-based agents for dynamic domain model generation and adaptation, with ReAct-style execution and natural language plan translation.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and the VirtualHome simulated environment.

Conclusion: TAPAS effectively integrates LLMs and symbolic planning for adaptive task-solving without manual redefinition.

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

### [110] [ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608)
*Zhiyuan Wang,Bokui Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChordPrompt, a framework for continual learning in vision-language models, addressing limitations in multi-domain task incremental learning and cross-modal information exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods lack strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning and neglect cross-modal interactions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: ChordPrompt uses cross-modal prompts for visual-textual interplay and domain-adaptive text prompts for continual adaptation across domains.

Result: ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance on multi-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChordPrompt enhances adaptability and efficiency of vision-language models in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs), a closed-loop framework integrating cognitive and embodied AI to overcome limitations in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI and automated labs lack adaptability and physical-world integration, hindering autonomous scientific discovery.

Method: ISLs combine foundation models for reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for physical experimentation.

Result: The framework aims to enable iterative, autonomous experimentation and serendipitous discovery.

Conclusion: ISLs are essential for advancing AI-driven science by unifying cognitive and embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [112] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the do-calculus to cyclic causal structures (DMGs) and proves its soundness and completeness for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs, unlike the ADMG setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often involve cyclic causal dynamics, but existing tools like ADMGs and C-DMGs are limited to acyclic structures. This work addresses the gap by generalizing to cyclic models (DMGs).

Method: The paper introduces input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) to handle cycles and extends the do-calculus to C-DMGs over DMGs, proving its soundness and completeness.

Result: The do-calculus is unconditionally sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs. Graphical criteria for non-identifiability also extend to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes causal effect identification to cyclic structures, providing a robust framework for high-dimensional and cyclic real-world systems.

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

*Ching Fang,Kanaka Rajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers, mimicking episodic memory, enable rapid in-context reinforcement learning, diverging from standard RL methods and resembling brain processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and animals adapt quickly to new environments, contrasting with slow standard reinforcement learning, by leveraging episodic memory-like mechanisms in transformers.

Method: Training a transformer on in-context reinforcement learning tasks inspired by rodent behavior, analyzing the emergent learning algorithms and representations.

Result: The model develops unique reinforcement learning strategies, caching computations in memory tokens, and aligns representations across environments, resembling hippocampal-entorhinal brain processes.

Conclusion: Memory acts as a computational resource for rapid adaptation, with transformer mechanisms mirroring natural cognition, offering insights into in-context learning.

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework for predictive maintenance (PdM) to address suboptimal decisions caused by prediction errors in traditional methods. It shows improved decision quality and robustness under model misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in model predictions limits industrial adoption of ML in PdM. The study aims to align predictive models with maintenance objectives to improve decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces the IEO framework, which jointly tunes predictive models and optimizes maintenance outcomes. It uses stochastic perturbation gradient descent for small datasets.

Result: Empirical results show IEO reduces maintenance regret by up to 22% compared to traditional ETO methods, especially when decision policies are misaligned.

Conclusion: The IEO framework enhances decision quality in PdM by mitigating prediction errors, supporting more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and improve accuracy in differential diagnosis using unstructured medical records.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA-v3 with low-rank adaptation on the DDXPlus dataset for differential diagnosis tasks.

Result: Superior performance in pathology prediction and differential diagnosis, with transparent, explainable results.

Conclusion: The platform offers reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving AI for clinical use, advancing medical document analysis.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis

TL;DR: AutoExperiment is a benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to implement and run ML experiments from research papers, scaling difficulty by masking code functions. Performance drops as complexity increases, highlighting challenges in code generation and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no existing benchmark to assess AI agents' capability to implement scientific ideas from varied starting code, bridging reproduction and replication.

Method: Agents are given a paper, a codebase with masked functions, and a command to run the experiment. They must generate missing code and reproduce results, with difficulty scaling by the number of masked functions.

Result: Performance declines as masked functions increase. Interactive agents outperform static ones, and multi-trial success rates surpass single-shot attempts.

Conclusion: AutoExperiment identifies key challenges in AI-driven scientific experimentation, serving as a benchmark for future progress.

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafting prompts for LLMs in KG construction is labor-intensive and brittle. Automatic prompt optimization can address this challenge.

Method: Evaluated automatic prompt optimizers (DSPy, APE, TextGrad) on triple extraction tasks using datasets SynthIE and REBEL, varying prompting strategies, LLMs, schema complexity, text length, and metrics.

Result: Automatic prompt optimization generates human-like prompts and improves triple extraction performance, particularly with complex schemas and larger texts.

Conclusion: Automatic prompt optimization is effective for triple extraction, offering a scalable alternative to manual prompt crafting.

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

*Teng Wang,Hailei Gong,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE, a strategy-guided RL framework with novel reward shaping, improves query rewriting for dense retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing exploration and inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current query rewriting methods require large supervised datasets or suffer from inefficient RL exploration, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces SAGE, which uses expert-crafted strategies (e.g., semantic expansion, entity disambiguation) in an RL framework with novel reward shaping (SCS and CRS).

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, reduces unnecessary exploration, and lowers inference costs while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Strategy-guided RL with nuanced reward shaping offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable paradigm for robust information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

*Menglong Zhang,Fuyuan Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimBelief is a meta-RL framework using task belief similarity for efficient exploration and adaptation in sparse reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of suboptimal exploitation in sparse reward environments by leveraging task belief similarity.

Method: Introduces a latent task belief metric to learn common structures of similar tasks and integrates it with specific task features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym tasks.

Conclusion: SimBelief enables rapid task identification and adaptation by effectively leveraging task belief similarity.

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

*Baochang Ren,Shuofei Qiao,Wenhao Yu,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL integrates factuality rewards into RL training to reduce hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs while preserving reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe hallucinations in slow-thinking LLMs due to unclear knowledge boundaries and lack of factual supervision in RL.

Method: Proposes Knowledge-enhanced RL (KnowRL), adding factuality rewards based on knowledge verification to guide fact-based reasoning.

Result: KnowRL reduces hallucinations in slow-thinking models on three datasets while maintaining reasoning performance on two others.

Conclusion: KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations by reinforcing fact-based reasoning, enhancing model reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code

### [121] [Evaluating Compliance with Visualization Guidelines in Diagrams for Scientific Publications Using Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19825)
*Johannes Rückert,Louise Bloch,Christoph M. Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs analyze diagrams for visualization guideline adherence, showing effectiveness in identifying issues like missing labels but struggle with image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often misuse diagrams, leading to misinformation. Automating analysis with VLMs can help identify and correct such issues.

Method: Five VLMs and five prompting strategies are tested on questions derived from visualization guidelines to evaluate diagram elements like axes, colors, and legends.

Result: VLMs excel in analyzing diagram types, 3D effects, and legends (high F1-scores) but fail on image quality and tick marks. Qwen2.5VL and summarizing prompting are top performers.

Conclusion: VLMs can automate diagram issue detection (e.g., missing labels) and the approach is extensible for broader visualization analysis.

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

*Guo Li,Zixiang Xu,Wei Zhang,Yikuan Hu,Xinyu Yang,Nikolay Aristov,Mingjie Tang,Elenna R Dugundji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Temporal-IRL model to predict port congestion by analyzing vessel behavior and berth scheduling, achieving excellent results using historical AIS data from Maher Terminal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate port congestion prediction is vital for optimizing supply chains, reducing delays, and ensuring timely deliveries by understanding vessel behavior and berth scheduling.

Method: The study uses historical AIS data to reconstruct berth schedules and applies Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to model berth scheduling priorities. A Temporal-IRL model is developed to predict vessel sequencing and port stay times.

Result: The model, trained on data from Maher Terminal (2015-2023), demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting port congestion.

Conclusion: The Temporal-IRL model effectively predicts port congestion by learning berth scheduling patterns, enhancing supply chain resilience and efficiency.

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for MARL, enhancing efficiency and stability through iterative LLM refinement, Monte Carlo sampling, and adaptive memory evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing cooperative inefficiency and training instability in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Method: Uses GRPO, node-wise Monte Carlo sampling, and marginal benefit-driven selection for targeted updates. Adaptive memory evolution repurposes GRPO rewards to eliminate repetitive reasoning.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to larger LLMs using smaller open-source models in general and domain-specific scenarios.

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 effectively balances decision-making and memory capabilities, improving MARL training stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

*Hexiang Gu,Qifan Yu,Saihui Hou,Zhiqin Fang,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemeMind, a large-scale, diverse, and explainable dataset for harmful meme detection, and MemeGuard, a framework that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of harmful memes on social media is a growing issue, but current datasets lack scale, diversity, and explainability, hindering progress in detection.

Method: The authors create MemeMind, a dataset with rigorous standards, bilingual support, and detailed annotations, and propose MemeGuard, a framework integrating multimodal information and reasoning.

Result: MemeGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection, as shown by experiments on the MemeMind dataset.

Conclusion: MemeMind and MemeGuard address critical gaps in harmful meme detection, providing a robust dataset and framework for future research.

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [125] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often mistake memorization for reasoning, leading to overconfidence and inconsistency in STEM tasks, especially in science and medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover whether LLMs genuinely learn reasoning or just memorize patterns, and how this affects their self-knowledge and trustworthiness.

Method: A novel framework evaluates LLMs' generalization and self-knowledge, focusing on STEM domains with standardized jargon and problems.

Result: LLMs show over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments due to reliance on memorized solutions, particularly in science and medicine.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures and training need improvement to balance self-knowledge and ensure explainability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

### [126] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng,Alisa Liu,Orevaoghene Ahia,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenizers map text to canonical token sequences, but non-canonical tokenizations exist. LMs retain high performance (up to 93.4%) with unseen tokenizations, especially stronger models. Non-canonical tokenizations can improve tasks like string manipulation (+14%) and arithmetic (+33%). Robustness stems from instruction-tuning, where post-trained models handle non-canonical inputs better than base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of language models (LMs) to non-canonical tokenizations and identify scenarios where such tokenizations can enhance performance.

Method: Evaluate LMs across 20 benchmarks using non-canonical tokenizations (randomly sampled and character-level). Compare performance of base and post-trained models.

Result: LMs retain high performance (up to 93.4%) with non-canonical tokenizations. Character-level tokenization improves string manipulation (+14%) and arithmetic (+33%). Post-trained models handle non-canonical inputs better than base models.

Conclusion: LMs are less dependent on their tokenizer than assumed. Non-canonical tokenizations can boost performance in specific tasks, and robustness is linked to instruction-tuning.

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FiSCo is a statistical framework for evaluating group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic biases in long-form responses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs overlook biases in long-form responses and intrinsic variability, undermining reliability.

Method: FiSCo decomposes outputs into claims, uses entailment checks for consistency, and applies statistical hypothesis testing to detect biases.

Result: FiSCo reliably identifies nuanced biases across demographic groups, reducing the impact of LLM variability.

Conclusion: FiSCo provides a robust framework for fairness evaluation in LLMs, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DUS introduces a planner-model-free method for parallel unmasking in masked diffusion language models, improving efficiency and quality in non-autoregressive text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing samplers for masked diffusion language models falter under parallel unmasking due to ignored token interactions and dependencies, limiting inference speed.

Method: DUS uses a first-order Markov assumption to partition tokens into non-adjacent groups, enabling parallel unmasking with minimal joint entropy.

Result: DUS reduces denoiser calls to O(log B) per block, outperforming confidence-based planners in math and code benchmarks.

Conclusion: DUS provides an efficient, lightweight solution for high-quality text generation, enhancing the potential of masked diffusion models.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLPnorth's submission to TalentCLEF 2025 compares methods for multilingual job title matching and job title-based skill prediction, finding prompting best for Task A and fine-tuned classification for Task B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving job market tasks like candidate matching and skill alignment.

Method: Compared fine-tuned classification, contrastive-based, and prompting methods, using extra data from ESCO.

Result: Task A: prompting (0.492 MAP); Task B: fine-tuned classification (0.290 MAP). Rankings: 5th/20 (Task A), 3rd/14 (Task B).

Conclusion: Multilingual language models perform best, with prompting excelling in Task A and fine-tuned classification in Task B.

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning via hate speech explanations, revealing misalignment between LLM outputs and human moral judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparent, multilingual benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning, especially in culturally diverse contexts.

Method: Developed MFTCXplain, a dataset of 3,000 tweets in four languages, annotated with hate speech labels, moral categories, and rationales, using Moral Foundation Theory.

Result: LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836) but poorly in predicting moral sentiments (F1 < 0.35), with limited rationale alignment in underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle to internalize human moral reasoning, highlighting the need for improved evaluation frameworks and model capabilities.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: $	exttt{StorySim}$ is a framework for generating synthetic stories to evaluate LLMs' theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities, avoiding data contamination. It reveals models perform better on WM than ToM tasks and exhibit biases like recency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks for evaluating ToM and WM in LLMs, particularly data contamination, and to enable precise manipulation of story elements.

Method: Uses a programmable $	exttt{Storyboard}$ to generate novel, compositional story prompts for first- and second-order ToM and WM tasks.

Result: Most LLMs perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks and show biases like recency bias. Models reason better with humans than inanimate objects.

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$ provides a controlled way to evaluate LLMs' ToM and WM capabilities, uncovering biases and performance gaps.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All

### [132] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations, revealing inconsistencies in nuanced reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from toxicity detection to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity, enhancing their trustworthiness in downstream tasks.

Method: Develops HAF, a multi-dimensional criterion, and six metrics to evaluate LLMs' toxicity explanations without human input.

Result: LLMs generate plausible explanations for simple prompts but fail in nuanced reasoning, producing inconsistent responses.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in LLMs' toxicity reasoning and provides tools for future research, with open-sourced code and data.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

*Yun Tang,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A joint speech and text optimization method (J-TAED) enhances ASR accuracy by unifying speech and text modalities during training, improving performance on in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large text corpora and address data scarcity in mismatch domains for ASR, enhancing accuracy without requiring additional speech data.

Method: Joint training of hybrid transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder (TAED) with speech and text inputs, unifying internal representations and enabling text-based domain adaptation.

Result: Reduced WER by 5.8-12.8% on Librispeech and 15.3-17.8% on out-of-domain datasets via text-based adaptation.

Conclusion: J-TAED effectively integrates speech and text, improving ASR performance and adaptability to new domains without speech data.

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

*Christopher Toukmaji,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual adaptation of LLMs for low-resource languages, comparing methods like few-shot prompting and translate-test with gradient-based techniques. Few-shot and translate-test outperform others, with degradation in trained models attributed to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages for in-context learning, and it's unclear how to adapt them effectively.

Method: Comprehensive study across five languages, three LLMs, and seven tasks, testing methods like few-shot prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, and more.

Result: Few-shot prompting and translate-test outperform gradient-based methods; degradation in trained models is linked to catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into effective adaptation techniques for low-resource languages, highlighting the limitations of gradient-based methods.

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

*Yichen Tang,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Min Zhang,Shaoping Ma,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new communication protocol for LLM-based multi-agent systems, using State Delta Encoding (SDE) to transfer reasoning logic and abstract thoughts more effectively, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems using natural language for communication suffer from information loss, especially for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces a protocol transferring both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectories, using SDE to encode state changes.

Result: Multi-agent systems with SDE outperform other protocols, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Communication augmentation via SDE enhances LLM-based multi-agent systems, showing promise for future applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

*Rasiq Hussain,Jerry Ma,Rithik Khandelwal,Joshua Oltmanns,Mehak Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid NLP method combining sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models and RNNs with attention to predict personality traits from long narratives, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personality assessment by leveraging NLP on long narratives, overcoming limitations of traditional questionnaires.

Method: A two-step approach: sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained models for embeddings, followed by RNNs with attention for long-range dependencies.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability compared to models like LLaMA and Longformer.

Conclusion: Combining language features with long-context modeling advances personality assessment from narratives.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

*Yuchang Zhu,Zhonghua zhen,Qunshu Lin,Haotong Wei,Xiaolong Sun,Zixuan Yu,Minghao Liu,Zibin Zheng,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the diversity of LLM-generated data impacts downstream model performance, finding that moderate diversity improves performance while high diversity harms it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked factor of data diversity in LLM-generated data and its effect on downstream models, especially in data-scarce domains.

Method: The study varies diversity levels in LLM-generated data and mixes it with real data to analyze downstream model performance.

Result: Moderately diverse LLM-generated data improves performance with minimal distribution shift, while highly diverse data negatively impacts it.

Conclusion: The findings provide guidance for using LLMs as data generators, emphasizing the importance of balanced diversity.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoStage enhances AI-driven counseling by improving empathetic response generation using open-source LLMs, addressing psychological state inference and counseling phase alignment without extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for mental health care and limitations of current AI approaches (e.g., lack of psychological understanding, data reliance, privacy issues) drive the need for a better framework.

Method: EmoStage uses perspective-taking to infer clients' states and needs, and phase recognition to align responses with counseling stages, leveraging open-source LLMs without additional training.

Result: Experiments in Japanese and Chinese settings show EmoStage improves response quality and competes with data-driven methods.

Conclusion: EmoStage effectively addresses current challenges in AI counseling, offering a practical and competitive solution.

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

TL;DR: A unified framework using Mamba (SSM) with phonological features and token strategies improves APA and MDD in CAPT, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective pronunciation feedback is crucial in L2 learning, and joint modeling of APA and MDD can yield mutual benefits.

Method: Leverages Mamba (SSM), integrates phonological features, and uses token strategies for interpretability and temporal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on the Speechocean762 benchmark, especially in MDD.

Conclusion: First study combining phonological attribution, SSM, and prompting in CAPT, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

*Jisu Shin,Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Hoyun Song,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an atomic-level evaluation framework for measuring persona fidelity in LLMs, detecting subtle deviations missed by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, causing inconsistencies in persona fidelity, which existing evaluation methods fail to capture finely.

Method: Introduces three key metrics for atomic-level evaluation of persona alignment and consistency within and across generations.

Result: Effectively detects persona inconsistencies overlooked by prior methods, revealing influences of task structure and persona desirability on model adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a precise, realistic assessment of persona fidelity, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona expression.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS) and Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE) to improve feature isolation and control in LLMs, showing enhanced interpretability and performance in tasks like toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for understanding and controlling LLMs struggle with feature localization and manipulation. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) show promise but lack reliable feature isolation.

Method: Proposes FMS to quantify feature monosemanticity and G-SAE, which conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training.

Result: G-SAE improves monosemanticity, interpretability, and control in tasks like toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidelines for advancing mechanistic interpretability and control in LLMs.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeilProbe is a framework for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs without human intervention, using sequence-to-sequence mapping and key token perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring data privacy and copyright protection by detecting pre-training texts in LLMs, especially in black-box settings where existing methods fail.

Method: Uses sequence-to-sequence mapping to infer latent features, performs key token perturbations, and employs a prototype-based classifier to avoid overfitting.

Result: Effective and superior performance in black-box settings, demonstrated on three datasets.

Conclusion: VeilProbe addresses limitations of existing methods and provides an automated solution for detecting pre-training texts in LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

*Yingji Zhang,Marco Valentino,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores embedding explicit reasoning rules in language models (LMs) using VAEs to improve generalization, interpretability, and controllability, showing success in disentangling rules and injecting prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMs rely on memorization for NLI tasks rather than rule-based inference, limiting interpretability and controllability.

Method: Proposes a pipeline for embedding reasoning rules in Transformer-based VAEs, including tasks, a theoretical framework, and an architecture.

Result: Disentangled reasoning rules, improved knowledge injection, and identified performance bottlenecks in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning rules in LMs enhance interpretability and performance, with practical insights for future model designs.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to predict human annotation disagreements, and RLVR-style reasoning worsens their performance in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can capture informative human annotation variation, not just majority labels.

Method: Extensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to predict annotation disagreements without repeated human labels.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in disagreement prediction, and RLVR reasoning degrades their performance further.

Conclusion: There's a need to evaluate and improve LLMs for disagreement modeling, as current methods overlook this aspect.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

TL;DR: MuBench is introduced as a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs across 61 languages, revealing gaps in language coverage and performance disparities, especially for low-resource languages. MLC is proposed as a new metric, and cross-lingual transfer dynamics are explored via pretraining experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for multilingual LLMs are limited and lack cross-lingual alignment, leading to fragmented assessments of multilingual capabilities.

Method: MuBench is developed to evaluate multilingual LLMs across 61 languages. Multilingual Consistency (MLC) is introduced as a metric. Pretraining experiments with 1.2B-parameter models on English and Chinese explore cross-lingual transfer.

Result: Notable gaps between claimed and actual language coverage are found, with performance disparities between English and low-resource languages. MLC provides insights into performance bottlenecks.

Conclusion: MuBench addresses limitations in multilingual LLM evaluation, and MLC offers a complementary metric for improvement. Pretraining experiments shed light on cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dialogue systems by generating contextually relevant synthetic turns using commonsense knowledge and evaluating their quality automatically.

Method: Uses pretrained LLMs for prompt-based generation and evaluation, inspired by Chain-of-Thought, and creates a novel dataset for testing.

Result: Preliminary results show LLMs effectively perform commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Conclusion: The approach successfully leverages LLMs for dialogue augmentation and evaluation, demonstrating potential for further development.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between educational theory and AI-driven conversational learning, ensuring LLM interactions align with sound pedagogy.

Method: Synthesizes literature on LLMs in education and pedagogical theories, mapping them to LLM capabilities and proposing practical strategies like Socratic prompting and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: Identifies gaps in applying traditional theories to LLMs (e.g., direct answers vs. co-construction) and suggests strategies to improve alignment.

Conclusion: Proposes ways to make LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive by integrating pedagogical principles and addressing LLM limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

### [148] [Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19492)
*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether efficient reasoning strategies in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce behavioral inconsistencies, finding that such strategies increase inconsistency despite improving token-level efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if compressing reasoning in LRMs reduces robustness and leads to omitted reasoning steps, potentially introducing behavioral inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces $ICBENCH$, a benchmark measuring inconsistency across three dimensions, applied to various LRMs.

Result: Larger models are more consistent but still exhibit scheming behaviors; efficient reasoning strategies increase inconsistency.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning improves efficiency but risks introducing inconsistencies, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

*Zeyu Li,Chuanfu Xiao,Yang Wang,Xiang Liu,Zhenheng Tang,Baotong Lu,Mao Yang,Xinyu Chen,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AnTKV is a framework for compressing KV cache in LLMs using Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization, achieving high efficiency and minimal accuracy loss under ultra-low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing memory footprint of KV cache in LLMs while minimizing performance degradation from ultra-low-bit quantization.

Method: Proposes Anchor Score (AnS) to quantify token sensitivity to quantization, then uses Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization (AnTKV) and a triton kernel for efficient deployment.

Result: Enables handling 840K tokens on an 80GB A100 GPU, 3.5x higher throughput than FP16, and outperforms prior works in 4-bit settings. Achieves low perplexity (6.32 at 1-bit, 8.87 at 0.375-bit) on Mistral-7B.

Conclusion: AnTKV effectively balances memory efficiency and model performance, outperforming existing methods in aggressive quantization scenarios.

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

TL;DR: The paper introduces heiDS, a pipeline using RAG for EHR-based QA, focusing on dynamic retrieval strategies like query-dependent-k, outperforming fixed-k methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve answer accuracy and relevance in clinical QA tasks by dynamically retrieving evidence from EHRs using advanced RAG strategies.

Method: A RAG framework with query-dependent-k retrieval strategies (including new methods autocut* and elbow) for EHR-based QA.

Result: The proposed dynamic retrieval strategy outperforms fixed-k methods in generating factual and relevant answers.

Conclusion: Dynamic retrieval strategies like query-dependent-k enhance the performance of RAG frameworks in clinical QA tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

*Natalia Bobkova,Laura Zanella-Calzada,Anyes Tafoughalt,Raphaël Teboul,François Plesse,Félix Gaschi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline combining NERL and fine-tuned LLMs improves structuring of French posology instructions, achieving 91% accuracy while balancing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity and irregularity in French posology instructions limit classic ML pipelines, necessitating more effective methods for medication safety and clinical decision support.

Method: The study compares prompt-based LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and a pre-LLM NERL system, proposing a hybrid approach that routes low-confidence NERL cases to LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs match baseline NERL accuracy, while the hybrid pipeline achieves 91% structuration accuracy with optimized computational cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of NERL and LLMs, offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

TL;DR: KnowMap dynamically builds a knowledge base to enhance LLMs' task-specific performance, improving GPT-4-Turbo by 17.71% on ScienceWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rapid adaptation to new tasks due to static pre-trained knowledge, and traditional fine-tuning is costly and prone to forgetting.

Method: KnowMap constructs a dynamic knowledge base from environmental and experiential data, fine-tuning a small knowledge-embedding model to augment a larger LLM.

Result: 17.71% performance improvement for GPT-4-Turbo on the ScienceWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: KnowMap efficiently adapts LLMs to tasks by integrating dynamic knowledge, enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Health Sentinel is a multi-stage pipeline using ML and non-ML methods to extract disease outbreak events from online articles, aiding timely public health intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disease surveillance is challenging; monitoring online media manually is impractical due to volume.

Method: Combines ML and non-ML methods in a multi-stage pipeline to extract structured health event data from online articles.

Result: Processed 300M+ articles, identified 95K+ health events, with 3.5K flagged as potential outbreaks by experts.

Conclusion: Health Sentinel effectively automates early outbreak detection, supporting public health responses.

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCStat leverages raw attention logits for better token importance analysis, enabling efficient key-value compression and high-fidelity attribution without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax-normalized attention weights obscure pre-Softmax query-key logits, limiting insights into token importance.

Method: Introduces RCStat, a framework using Relative Contextualization (RC) to analyze raw attention logits, with an efficient upper bound for RC.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression (adaptive key-value eviction) and attribution (token, sentence, chunk-level) performance.

Conclusion: RCStat outperforms post-Softmax methods, offering significant empirical gains in question answering, summarization, and attribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

TL;DR: The paper examines MT metric performance by comparing it to human baselines, finding that automatic metrics often match or exceed human performance, but cautions against overinterpreting these results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper bounds of MT metric performance and assess whether current metrics can reliably measure progress in MT evaluation.

Method: Incorporating human baselines in MT meta-evaluation to compare automatic metrics' agreement with human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art metrics often perform on par with or better than human baselines, suggesting human parity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for caution in interpreting metric performance and raise questions about reliably measuring progress in MT evaluation.

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

TL;DR: ECCoT is a framework to validate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs, improving interpretability and trustworthiness by integrating MRF-ETM for topic-aware reasoning and CSBert for causal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, necessitating methods to validate reasoning chains for better interpretability.

Method: ECCoT uses MRF-ETM for topic-aware Chain of Thought generation and CSBert for causal reasoning alignment, filtering ineffective chains with structured statistics.

Result: ECCoT enhances interpretability, reduces biases, and improves the trustworthiness of LLM-based decision-making.

Conclusion: ECCoT introduces a novel framework for validating reasoning chains in LLMs, combining topic-driven generation and causal alignment for reliable outputs.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for detecting hate-mongers by analyzing user texts, activity, and networks, showing improved accuracy over text and graph-based methods across diverse platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance online discourse detoxification and understand hate proliferation by focusing on user-level detection, addressing gaps in prior work that primarily focused on hateful utterances.

Method: A multimodal aggregative approach combining hateful texts, user activity, and network data, evaluated on Twitter, Gab, and Parler datasets.

Result: The method significantly improves hate-monger detection compared to text and graph-based methods, performing well across different platforms and large datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances classification of coded messages and informs interventions, demonstrating robustness across diverse content platforms.

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, particularly in news summarization, by leveraging self-correcting methods.

Method: Apply two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems to correct hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. Analyze performance and insights.

Result: Reveals practical benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot prompts, and high alignment between G-Eval and human evaluation.

Conclusion: Self-correcting methods show promise for reducing hallucinations in news summarization, with practical insights for improvement.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates LLMs with RL for adaptable, efficient, and personalized goal-oriented dialogue systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language

TL;DR: RPT improves LLM reasoning but generalizes inconsistently to new domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalizability of Reinforcement Post Training (RPT) in LLMs beyond fine-tuned domains.

Method: Conducted observational and interventional studies comparing RPT models across seen and unseen domains.

Result: RPT shows gains in similar domains but inconsistent or no gains in domains with different reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: RPT's benefits are domain-specific and do not reliably generalize to unfamiliar reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using synthetic vignettes from HPO data predicts diagnostic performance changes in Symptom Checkers (SCs) for rare diseases, validated with high R-squared values for recall and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating SC algorithm updates for rare diseases is challenging due to lack of data and high costs of manual vignette creation.

Method: Generate synthetic vignettes using HPO disease-phenotype annotations, simulate SC interviews, and compare predicted vs. actual performance changes.

Result: High R-squared values (0.831 for recall@8, 0.78 for precision@8) validate the method for diseases with HPO frequency data. Manual effort is ~2 hours per disease.

Conclusion: The method offers a transparent, low-cost way to pre-deployment evaluate SC updates for rare diseases, aiding early diagnosis.

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance when mixed with high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by recycling discarded low-quality web data to supplement limited high-quality data.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to transform and enrich low-quality documents for training, mixing them with high-quality data.

Result: Improves performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across 22 tasks and outperforms 2x web data or other synthetic data methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

### [164] [Accurate, fast, cheap: Choose three. Replacing Multi-Head-Attention with Bidirectional Recurrent Attention for Long-Form ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19761)
*Martin Ratajczak,Jean-Philippe Robichaud,Jennifer Drexler Fox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces bidirectional recurrent attention (RA) layers for long-form ASR, matching MHA accuracy while being more efficient, and proposes Direction Dropout for regularization and throughput control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-head attention (MHA) models are inefficient for long-form ASR due to quadratic complexity. The goal is to develop a more efficient and accurate alternative.

Method: The paper uses bidirectional RA layers, compares them to limited-context attention (LCA), and introduces Direction Dropout for regularization and throughput optimization.

Result: RA layers match MHA accuracy, outperform LCA with 44% higher throughput, and Direction Dropout improves accuracy and enables new decoding modes.

Conclusion: Bidirectional RA with Direction Dropout is a superior alternative to MHA and LCA for long-form ASR, offering better efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRFT unifies SFT and RL in a single-stage method, outperforming traditional approaches on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimally integrating SFT and RL in LLMs for reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes SRFT, a single-stage method using entropy-aware weighting to combine SFT and RL.

Result: Achieves 59.1% average accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% and 10.9% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRFT effectively integrates SFT and RL, improving LLM performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing open-source LLMs' data analysis capabilities, identifying strategic planning as key, and proposes a data synthesis method for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LLMs struggle with reasoning-intensive tasks like data analysis, prompting the need for enhancement strategies.

Method: Curated a seed dataset for evaluation across data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning, leading to a data synthesis methodology.

Result: Findings highlight strategic planning's importance, the influence of interaction design and task complexity, and data quality's impact over diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed data synthesis method significantly improves open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model to detect communal violence in Bengali social media text, achieving improved performance but facing challenges in context understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of cyber hatred and its role in communal violence necessitates accurate detection methods, especially for understudied languages like Bengali.

Method: A fine-tuned BanglaBERT model and an ensemble model were developed, with dataset expansion to address imbalance. LIME was used for interpretability.

Result: The ensemble model achieved a macro F1 score of 0.63, outperforming the fine-tuned BanglaBERT (0.60). Contextual understanding limitations were identified.

Conclusion: The study advances communal violence detection in Bengali, highlighting NLP's potential and the need for improved context understanding.

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility of current multimodal medical LLMs.

Method: Decomposes diagnosis into specialized roles (e.g., General Practitioner, Radiologist) using LLM-based agents for modular collaboration.

Result: MAM consistently outperforms modality-specific LLMs, achieving 18%-365% performance improvements.

Conclusion: MAM's modular approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and flexibility, leveraging existing LLMs and knowledge bases.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HI-SQL improves Text-to-SQL generation by using historical query logs to generate hints, reducing errors and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in handling complex SQL queries (multi-table joins, nested conditions) with existing multi-step pipelines, which are costly and error-prone.

Method: Proposes HI-SQL, a pipeline with a hint generation mechanism using historical query logs to guide SQL generation, avoiding multi-step approaches.

Result: Significantly improves query accuracy and efficiency in LLM-generated SQL, reducing latency and LLM calls.

Conclusion: HI-SQL offers a robust and practical solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

*Shuang Ao,Yi Dong,Jinwei Hu,Sarvapali Ramchurn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLoRA improves safety in LoRA-fine-tuned LLMs by pruning unsafe layers, using E-DIEM for detection, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA can weaken safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing harmful outputs. Existing methods fail to address this effectively.

Method: Proposes SPLoRA, a pruning-based approach using E-DIEM to detect and remove unsafe LoRA layers, balancing safety and performance.

Result: SPLoRA reduces safety risks, maintains or improves performance, and lowers inference overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPLoRA is a scalable, efficient solution for safer and more reliable LLMs, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) introduces sequential expert communication in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, improving performance and reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MoE models lack dynamic expert interaction; CoE aims to enhance representational capacity and flexibility.

Method: CoE processes tokens iteratively with dynamic expert selection via dedicated routers at each step.

Result: CoE reduces validation loss (1.20 to 1.12) and memory usage (17.6-42%) while matching performance of wider models.

Conclusion: CoE's iterative routing and residual structure unlock expressive representations, offering a new scaling axis.

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mixed feature attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online prediction of product weight in injection molding, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address untimely detection and online monitoring lag in injection molding quality anomalies.

Method: Integrates mechanism-based and data-driven analysis, decoupling time series and non-time series data, with a self-attention mechanism for feature fusion.

Result: Achieves RMSE of 0.0281, outperforming benchmarks by 15.6-25.7% in accuracy. Mixed feature modeling and attention mechanism contribute 22.4% and 11.2% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: The MFA-ANN model provides an efficient and reliable solution for intelligent quality control in injection molding.

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning pipeline using SHM sensor networks and GNNs achieves high accuracy in traffic monitoring, addressing limitations of CV-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges deteriorate over time, requiring reliable traffic monitoring. CV-based methods have privacy and lighting issues, while traditional methods lack flexibility.

Method: Integrates CV-assisted dataset generation with GNNs for SHM sensor data, transferring knowledge from CV to sensors.

Result: Achieves 99% accuracy for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles in real-world testing.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers accurate, automated traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

TL;DR: Learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks outperform gradient, occlusion, and permutation methods in dynamic timeseries prediction for critical care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of interpretability in dynamic prediction tasks for critical care, where traditional methods fail due to time-varying dependencies and temporal smoothness.

Method: Systematic analysis of failure modes in common interpretability algorithms and proposal of learnable mask-based frameworks with temporal continuity and label consistency constraints.

Result: Learnable mask-based approaches provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for dynamic timeseries prediction.

Conclusion: Learnable mask-based methods are better suited for interpretability in critical care and similar domains.

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel LLM-augmented method for generating causally fair synthetic health data, reducing bias by 70% compared to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of causal fairness in synthetic health data generation to ensure equitable outcomes.

Method: Develops an LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method, preserving causal structure in real-world tabular health data.

Result: Generated data deviates <10% from real data on causal fairness metrics and reduces bias by 70%.

Conclusion: Enables fair synthetic data access, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates music generation models by comparing human preferences with objective metrics, using a large-scale survey and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the quality of generated music is challenging due to the subjective nature of human preferences, and existing metrics may not align well with human judgment.

Method: The study generates 6k songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conducts a survey with 15k pairwise comparisons involving 2.5k participants to correlate human preferences with metrics.

Result: The work ranks current music generation models and metrics based on human preference, providing insights into their alignment.

Conclusion: The study offers a dataset of generated music and human evaluations to advance subjective metric evaluation in music generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise

of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of

### [179] [Finetuning a Weather Foundation Model with Lightweight Decoders for Unseen Physical Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19088)
*Fanny Lehmann,Firat Ozdemir,Benedikt Soja,Torsten Hoefler,Siddhartha Mishra,Sebastian Schemm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates Aurora, an AI weather foundation model, for predicting hydrological variables not in its pretraining. A lightweight decoder approach outperforms full fine-tuning in efficiency and accuracy, showing Aurora's latent space captures physical relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if foundation models like Aurora can predict new hydrological variables without full fine-tuning, making them more accessible and useful in Earth sciences.

Method: Compare a lightweight decoder trained on Aurora's latent space to full fine-tuning. The decoder approach is tested for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The decoder method reduces training time by 50% and memory by 35%, maintaining accuracy and autoregressive stability. Accuracy depends on physical correlations in Aurora's latent space.

Conclusion: Foundation models in Earth sciences should be extendable to new variables without full fine-tuning, enhancing accessibility and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

### [180] [On the algorithmic construction of deep ReLU networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19104)
*Daan Huybrechs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural networks as algorithms, constructing exact solutions like sorting, and analyzes their recursive and parallel nature compared to conventional algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically understand what neural networks can represent, focusing on their algorithmic capabilities rather than training from data.

Method: Constructs explicit neural networks (e.g., for sorting) and analyzes their properties, emphasizing recursion, parallelism, and the role of depth.

Result: Neural networks as algorithms are recursive, parallel, and depth-dependent, with deep networks outperforming shallow ones.

Conclusion: Neural networks, when viewed as algorithms, exhibit unique properties like recursion and parallelism, constrained by continuity and depth.

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

*Kenneth L. Clarkson,Lior Horesh,Takuya Ito,Charlotte Park,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can exactly implement Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering, proven theoretically and demonstrated numerically, with potential for novel clustering variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if transformers can learn and implement precise algorithms, specifically Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering.

Method: Theoretical proof of a transformer architecture (k-means transformer) using attention and residual connections, followed by numerical implementation and experiments.

Result: Exact correspondence between the transformer and Lloyd's algorithm, with interpretable alterations yielding novel clustering variants.

Conclusion: Transformers can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering interpretable implementations of algorithms.

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

*Andreas Bjerregaard,Søren Hauberg,Anders Krogh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Riemannian generative decoder to simplify manifold-valued representation learning by eliminating the encoder and using a Riemannian optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Riemannian representation learning involve complex density approximations and manifold constraints, limiting their applicability and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses a Riemannian generative decoder to find manifold-valued maximum likelihood latents, discarding the encoder to simplify manifold constraints.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, the method captures non-Euclidean structure and aligns with data geometry.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies manifold learning, is compatible with existing architectures, and produces interpretable latent spaces.

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned using local rules, leveraging force measurements or observed dynamics. It validates this with a network of nonlinear oscillators, testing on Gaussian mixtures and MNIST digit sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how SGMs' driving protocols can be learned efficiently using local rules, enabling practical applications in systems like nonlinear oscillators.

Method: The gradient for the driving protocol's parameters is derived from force measurements or dynamics. Implemented in a network of driven, nonlinear oscillators, tested on 2D Gaussian mixtures and MNIST digit sampling.

Result: Successful learning of the SGM driving protocol via local rules, demonstrated through sampling from Gaussian mixtures and generating MNIST digit images.

Conclusion: Local learning rules can effectively train SGMs, as shown in practical implementations, offering potential for scalable and efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

*Barry Wang,Avi Schwarzschild,Alexander Robey,Ali Payani,Charles Fleming,Mingjie Sun,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Command-V is a backpropagation-free method for transferring behaviors between LLMs by copying and pasting residual activation adapters, requiring minimal compute and no original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrofitting LLMs with new behaviors is costly and repetitive; Command-V aims to simplify this process.

Method: Profiles layer activations, derives linear converters between layers, and applies donor interventions in the recipient's activation space.

Result: Matches or exceeds finetuning performance in safety-refusal, jailbreak facilitation, and chain-of-thought reasoning with far less compute.

Conclusion: Command-V offers an efficient, low-cost alternative to traditional finetuning for behavior transfer in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

*Paul C. Bogdan,Uzay Macar,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes sentence-level analysis for interpreting reasoning in large language models, introducing three attribution methods to identify influential "thought anchors."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing interpretability challenges in long-form chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing the process at the sentence level.

Method: Three attribution methods: (1) black-box counterfactual importance, (2) white-box attention pattern aggregation, (3) causal attribution via attention suppression.

Result: Identified "thought anchors"—key reasoning steps (e.g., planning/backtracking) with disproportionate influence.

Conclusion: Sentence-level analysis enhances understanding of reasoning models, supported by consistent findings across methods.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

*Amir Faiyaz,Tara Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradualDiff-Fed is an FL framework for fine-tuning LLMs efficiently by transmitting only weight differences, reducing communication costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for privacy-preserving, decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs in specialized domains like medical science, addressing challenges in performance and large model sizes.

Method: Introduces GradualDiff-Fed, which transmits model weight differences instead of the full model during FL training rounds to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized training with significantly reduced communication costs.

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed is a scalable and efficient solution for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs in distributed settings.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

*Xingyue Huang,Xianglong Hu,Zifeng Ding,Yuan He,Rishabh,Waleed Alzarooni,Ziyu Ye,Wendong Fan,Bailan He,Haige Bo,Changran Hu,Guohao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to distill tool knowledge into LLMs via natural language, improving math problem-solving without inference-time tool dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with exact computation and multi-step algebraic reasoning, and tool-integrated reasoning introduces scalability issues.

Method: Proposes distilling tool knowledge into LLMs using natural language. Involves a Solver Agent for problem-solving, a Translator Agent for tool call explanations, and a Rephrase Agent for coherent narratives.

Result: Fine-tuning a small model on synthesized traces improves performance on math benchmarks without needing tools at inference.

Conclusion: The approach effectively internalizes tool knowledge and reasoning patterns, enhancing LLM performance in math tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

### [188] [Private Model Personalization Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19220)
*Conor Snedeker,Xinyu Zhou,Raef Bassily*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a differentially private federated learning algorithm for model personalization, improving privacy and utility guarantees under heterogeneous user data and noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of privately recovering shared embeddings and local representations in federated learning, especially under heterogeneous user data and noisy labels.

Method: A private, efficient federated learning algorithm based on FedRep, incorporating differential privacy and handling sub-Gaussian user distributions. Uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for dimension reduction.

Result: Improved privacy error term by a factor of O~(dk) and achieved dimension-independent risk bounds under a margin loss in binary classification.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances privacy and utility, offering robust performance in federated learning with heterogeneous data.

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of studying singularities in PDEs using PINNs, especially in unbounded domains, by achieving high-precision solutions.

Method: A modularized approach involving neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization algorithm, combined with computer-assisted proofs and PDE analysis.

Result: High-precision solutions for 1D Burgers equation and improved loss for 2D Boussinesq equation compared to prior work.

Conclusion: High-precision PINNs can effectively study singularities in PDEs, with potential for machine precision in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

Motivation: To extend the study of kernel universality to non-Euclidean domains, specifically Riemannian symmetric spaces, and justify their application in machine learning for manifold-valued data.

Method: Develops tools to analyze kernel universality in Riemannian symmetric spaces and applies these tools to prove universality for recent kernel examples.

Result: Proves the universality of several positive definite kernels on Riemannian symmetric spaces, supporting their practical use.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations for kernel methods in non-Euclidean domains, enhancing their applicability to manifold-valued data.

Abstract: The universality properties of kernels characterize the class of functions
that can be approximated in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space and
are of fundamental importance in the theoretical underpinning of kernel methods
in machine learning. In this work, we establish fundamental tools for
investigating universality properties of kernels in Riemannian symmetric
spaces, thereby extending the study of this important topic to kernels in
non-Euclidean domains. Moreover, we use the developed tools to prove the
universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated contrastive learning method for anomaly detection in distributed systems, addressing privacy, heterogeneity, and pattern recognition challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of centralized anomaly detection methods, particularly in data privacy, node heterogeneity, and fine-grained anomaly recognition.

Method: Combines federated learning for distributed collaboration with contrastive learning for feature discrimination. Uses local node embeddings, positive/negative sample pairs, and federated aggregation to train a global model without raw data exposure.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability, effectively detecting complex anomalies in distributed environments.

Conclusion: The method balances privacy and performance, offering a viable solution for intelligent security in distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reward hacking in large language models (LLMs) due to imperfect reward models and introduces methods like Best-of-Poisson (BoP) and HedgeTune to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models, though useful, are imperfect proxies for alignment goals, leading to reward hacking where overoptimization reduces performance. This work aims to characterize and mitigate this issue.

Method: The study analyzes reward hacking under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), introduces Best-of-Poisson (BoP), and proposes HedgeTune for optimal inference-time parameter selection.

Result: Hedging mitigates reward hacking, achieving better tradeoffs between reward and distortion with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: Hedging is an effective tactical choice to avoid overconfidence in proxy rewards, and HedgeTune provides a practical solution to mitigate reward hacking in LLMs.

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a global Lipschitz regularization method to enhance the robustness of Behavior Cloning policies against observation perturbations, providing a robustness certificate and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior Cloning (BC) policies can be misled by measurement errors or adversarial disturbances in observations during deployment, leading to sub-optimal actions.

Method: The authors use global Lipschitz regularization to ensure policy robustness, construct a Lipschitz neural network, and provide a robustness certificate for bounded norm perturbations.

Result: The method is empirically validated across various Gymnasium environments, demonstrating improved robustness.

Conclusion: Global Lipschitz regularization effectively enhances the robustness of BC policies against observation perturbations, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle underperformance of minority classes and their sensitivity to structural noise in graph data.

Method: Proposes Constrained Mean Optimization (CMO) for minority class robustness and Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) for dynamic sample weighting.

Result: Significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and classification accuracy validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address challenges in Graph OOD classification, enhancing performance and robustness.

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

### [195] [A Batch-Insensitive Dynamic GNN Approach to Address Temporal Discontinuity in Graph Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19282)
*Yang Zhou,Xiaoning Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BADGNN is a batch-agnostic framework for dynamic graph neural networks, addressing temporal discontinuity caused by large batches via Temporal Lipschitz Regularization and Adaptive Attention Adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch sizes in MDGNNs disrupt temporal continuity, degrading performance and complicating optimization.

Method: Proposes BADGNN with Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to limit parameter search space and Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to correct attention distortion.

Result: BADGNN outperforms TGN, enabling larger batches and faster training while maintaining performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: BADGNN effectively mitigates temporal discontinuity and optimization challenges in dynamic graph neural networks.

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

### [196] [Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289)
*Yan Li,Zengli Yang,Youhuai Wang,Jing Wang,Xiaoyu Han,Jingyu Wang,Dongyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based method (PGNN) for the Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem in power systems, improving accuracy and computation speed for online relay setting calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The volatility of renewable energy systems demands faster, more efficient EOCS methods for online relay setting calculation, which existing methods fail to provide.

Method: A parallel graph neural network (PGNN) processes power system data structured into four layers (component, topology, electrical distance, graph distance) to predict extreme operating conditions.

Result: The PGNN method outperforms existing methods in accuracy and significantly reduces online computation time, validated on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems.

Conclusion: The proposed PGNN method is efficient and accurate for online EOCS, addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy integration.

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

### [197] [The Effect of Depth on the Expressivity of Deep Linear State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19296)
*Zeyu Bao,Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how depth and width affect the expressiveness of deep linear state-space models (SSMs), showing equivalence without constraints but differing effects under norm constraints, with deep SSMs outperforming shallow ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how depth and width influence the expressive capacity of deep linear SSMs, addressing a gap in theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs.

Method: Systematic investigation of depth and width in deep linear SSMs, including theoretical proofs and numerical validation.

Result: Without constraints, depth and width are equivalent; under norm constraints, deep SSMs outperform shallow ones in representing targets with large norms.

Conclusion: Deep SSMs are more expressive under norm constraints, and the paper provides bounds on minimal depth for representation.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

*Ahmad Mohammad Saber,Aditi Maheshwari,Amr Youssef,Deepa Kundur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks can evade deep learning-based FDIA detection in smart grids. A novel attack framework using Fast Gradient Sign Method shows high success rates. Adversarial training improves model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in deep learning-based FDIA detection systems and propose defenses against adversarial attacks.

Method: Proposed an adversarial attack framework using Fast Gradient Sign Method to perturb LCDR measurements. Evaluated robustness of various deep learning models under adversarial conditions.

Result: Deep learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with success rates exceeding 99.7%. Adversarial training significantly improves robustness.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to FDIA detection in smart grids. Adversarial training is an effective defense mechanism.

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

*Vineet Punyamoorty,Aditya Malusare,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CroMoTEX is a contrastive learning framework that uses chest X-rays during training to improve ECG representations for cardiac pathologies, achieving high performance without needing CXRs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal data (ECGs and CXRs) for better cardiac assessment, especially where CXRs are unavailable during deployment.

Method: Uses a supervised cross-modal contrastive objective with adaptive hard negative weighting to align ECG and CXR representations.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema in large-scale datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR).

Conclusion: CroMoTEX enables scalable ECG-based diagnosis by learning from CXRs during training, proving effective for cardiac pathologies.

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) in crash data using database narrative alignment and BERT, analyzing 371,062 Iowa crash records (2016-2022) to identify 2,767 AIM incidents (24.03%). Findings suggest alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have lower AIM, while unknown vehicle types and older drivers are more prone. Geospatial clusters highlight regions needing targeted education and training.


<details>

Motivation: Road traffic crashes are a major global cause of fatalities, necessitating accurate crash data for prevention and policy. The study tackles AIM to improve data quality in crash management systems.

Method: Employed database narrative alignment and BERT model to analyze 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022). Used Probit Logit model to explore crash characteristics affecting AIM.

Result: Identified 2,767 AIM incidents (24.03%). Alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents had lower AIM; unknown vehicle types and older drivers were more susceptible. Geospatial clusters revealed high-risk regions.

Conclusion: Targeted training programs and improved data management are needed to enhance crash reporting accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking.

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGMAE, a Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder, to improve graph representation learning by reconstructing discrepancy information between nodes, especially for heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to generalize to heterophilic graphs as they ignore node discrepancies, leading to indistinguishable representations.

Method: DGMAE reconstructs discrepancy information of neighboring nodes during masking to enhance distinguishability.

Result: Experiments on 17 datasets show DGMAE preserves node discrepancies and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification, clustering, and graph classification.

Conclusion: DGMAE effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in graph self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

*Puneesh Deora,Bhavya Vasudeva,Tina Behnia,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers use in-context learning to adapt to tasks of varying complexity, favoring the simplest sufficient explanation, akin to Bayesian Occam's razor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle hierarchical task structures and complexity levels in practical scenarios.

Method: Controlled testbeds with Markov chains and linear regression, plus theoretical Bayesian framework analysis.

Result: Transformers identify appropriate complexity levels and parameters, favoring simpler explanations when sufficient.

Conclusion: Transformers inherently implement a Bayesian Occam's razor, balancing fit and complexity, validated on GPT-4.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

*Shijian Zheng,Fangxiao Jin,Shuhai Zhang,Quan Xue,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PQS is a novel method for EMS design that uses quadtree-based hierarchical representation and consistency-driven sample selection to reduce evaluation costs and improve efficiency under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for EMS design are data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: PQS converts image-like layouts into quadtree-based hierarchical representations for progressive search and introduces a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism to balance exploitation and exploration.

Result: PQS outperforms baseline methods, reducing evaluation costs by 75-85% and saving 20.27-38.80 days in design cycles for real-world tasks like Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna.

Conclusion: PQS offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for EMS design, significantly improving efficiency under limited computational budgets.

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: FIM enhances cooperative MARL under sparse rewards by directing agent influence to critical state dimensions (CoG) using stability analysis, counterfactual rewards, and eligibility-trace-based credit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards in MARL limit exploration and coordination, necessitating a mechanism to focus agent influence on task-critical elements for better cooperation.

Method: FIM identifies CoG state dimensions, designs counterfactual intrinsic rewards, and uses eligibility-trace-based credit to synchronize focus.

Result: FIM outperforms baselines in diverse MARL benchmarks, improving cooperative performance in sparse reward settings.

Conclusion: FIM effectively addresses sparse reward challenges in MARL by targeting critical state dimensions, enhancing cooperation and performance.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

*Florian Peter Busch,Moritz Willig,Florian Guldan,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tag-based causal discovery method improves robustness by assigning multiple tags to variables, leveraging existing causal discovery techniques to direct edges and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current type-based causal discovery lacks flexibility due to single-type assignments, limiting robustness in directing causal relations.

Method: Proposes a tag-based approach where variables have multiple tags. Uses existing methods to direct edges, then determines tag relations to guide undirected edges.

Result: Experimental evaluations show improved causal discovery and alignment with common knowledge.

Conclusion: Tag-based causal discovery offers a more flexible and robust alternative to single-type methods.

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple method to reduce overestimation bias in Q-learning and actor-critic methods using distributional RL, improving existing algorithms with minimal code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overestimation bias in Q-values hinders convergence in RL algorithms, and modern methods often include mechanisms to mitigate this. The paper aims to provide a locally adaptive solution.

Method: The method leverages distributional RL to control overestimation adaptively. It integrates with existing algorithms (e.g., double Q-learning) with minimal code changes.

Result: Experiments in tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo environments validate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is simple, effective, and easily integrable into existing distributional RL algorithms to mitigate overestimation bias.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEGNN and DistEGNN enhance equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs, improving efficiency and performance on sparse or distributed graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant GNNs face efficiency and performance issues with large or sparsified graphs.

Method: FastEGNN uses virtual nodes for approximation and MMD minimization; DistEGNN extends this for distributed processing.

Result: Superior efficiency and performance on benchmarks like N-body systems and Fluid113K.

Conclusion: The models advance large-scale equivariant graph learning, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MU attack research requires access to original models, violating privacy goals. This study explores recalling forgotten class memberships from unlearned models without such access.

Method: A teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture is used, treating unlearned models as noisy labelers. The problem is framed as Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) to infer correct labels of forgotten instances.

Result: Experiments show MRA effectively recovers class memberships of unlearned instances across state-of-the-art MU methods and real datasets.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities, demonstrating significant privacy risks in current MU implementations.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

*Zhihao Sui,Liang Hu,Jian Cao,Usman Naseem,Zhongyuan Lai,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COLUR is a framework for restoring model performance degraded by noisy labels, using a neuroscience-inspired unlearning and relearning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in deep learning models caused by noisy labels, leveraging neuroscience's forgetting mechanism.

Method: Proposes COLUR, a co-training architecture for unlearning noise and refining label confidence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real datasets.

Conclusion: COLUR effectively restores and refines model performance in noisy-label scenarios.

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

### [213] [Dimension Reduction for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19537)
*Paul Kahlmeyer,Markus Fischer,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative dimension reduction method for symbolic regression by identifying and substituting variable combinations, improving algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression struggles with complex formulas due to increasing variables and operators. Exploiting fixed variable combinations in natural formulas can simplify the problem.

Method: The method searches for small valid substitutions in the expression space and tests their validity via functional dependence, integrating with any symbolic regression approach.

Result: The approach reliably identifies valid substitutions and significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

Conclusion: Iterative dimension reduction via substitution is effective for simplifying symbolic regression and boosting algorithm performance.

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

### [214] [Overtuning in Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19540)
*Lennart Schneider,Bernd Bischl,Matthias Feurer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates overtuning, a form of overfitting in hyperparameter optimization (HPO), showing it's more common than assumed and can degrade generalization in 10% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether excessive optimization of validation error in HPO leads to overfitting (overtuning), a phenomenon underexplored in literature.

Method: Formally defines overtuning, distinguishes it from related concepts, and conducts a large-scale reanalysis of HPO benchmark data.

Result: Overtuning is prevalent (10% of cases show worse generalization than defaults), typically mild but occasionally severe, influenced by factors like dataset size and HPO method.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for awareness and mitigation strategies, especially in small-data regimes.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression is adapted to find Lie point symmetries for ODEs, outperforming existing CASs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated solving of nonlinear ODEs is challenging, and existing CASs struggle with finding Lie point symmetries.

Method: Search-based symbolic regression is adapted to identify generators of Lie point symmetries.

Result: The approach successfully finds symmetries that current CASs cannot detect.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression offers a promising alternative for solving ODEs by uncovering hidden symmetries.

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

### [216] [ConCM: Consistency-Driven Calibration and Matching for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19558)
*QinZhe Wang,Zixuan Chen,Keke Huang,Xiu Su,Chunhua Yang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConCM, a framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that optimizes feature-structure consistency to mitigate knowledge conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods suffer from prototype deviation and fixed embedding spaces, limiting performance. The paper aims to address these issues by ensuring feature-structure consistency.

Method: Proposes ConCM with memory-aware prototype calibration for feature consistency and dynamic structure matching for adaptive alignment to optimal manifold spaces.

Result: ConCM outperforms existing methods by 3.20% and 3.68% on mini-ImageNet and CUB200 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses FSCIL challenges through dual consistency optimization, achieving superior performance without class-number priors.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

*Pengpeng Ouyang,Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Shuo Feng,Zhao Jin,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAF is a framework for multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting, combining generalized and task-specific features to improve accuracy with sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of insufficient historical data and lack of generalized/specific feature extraction in traditional methods.

Method: Uses three modules: GKM (generalized features via meta-learning), TSM (task-specific features), and RM (dynamic selection of relevant features).

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving a 41.81% improvement on CO₂ emissions dataset.

Conclusion: FAF enables robust and personalized forecasting with limited data.

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open dataset of QI-like stellarator plasma boundaries, paired with equilibria and metrics, to address the lack of standardized benchmarks in stellarator optimization. It provides three optimization benchmarks and aims to facilitate cross-disciplinary progress in fusion energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized optimization problems and datasets for QI stellarators hinders broader community progress in fusion energy research.

Method: Generated a dataset by sampling QI fields and optimizing plasma boundaries, introduced three benchmarks with reference code and baselines, and demonstrated data-driven model efficiency.

Result: The dataset and benchmarks enable efficient generation of novel configurations without expensive simulations, lowering barriers for optimization and ML researchers.

Conclusion: Openly releasing the dataset and benchmarks aims to accelerate progress in stellarator design and fusion energy development.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

*Alan N. Amin,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepWAS uses fast linear algebra to train large neural networks for genetic prediction, outperforming traditional methods by optimizing full likelihood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Genetic models are bottlenecked by expensive linear algebra, limiting model size and accuracy. DeepWAS aims to overcome this.

Method: Leverages modern fast linear algebra to train large neural networks, optimizing full likelihood instead of simplified statistics.

Result: Larger models improve predictions only with full likelihood; more features enhance accuracy for disease and therapeutic targets.

Conclusion: DeepWAS enables scalable, accurate genetic predictions, advancing disease research and target identification.

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

*Pantelis R. Vlachas,Konstantinos Vlachas,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLieNet introduces a framework to learn global mappings for handling parametric variability in dynamical systems, enabling smooth transitions and generalization across parameter regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric variability in dynamical systems leads to diverse model behaviors, challenging generalization across parameter regimes.

Method: PHLieNet learns a global mapping from parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and maps this embedding to weights of a dynamics propagation network, using a hypernetwork to generate target network weights.

Result: PHLieNet outperforms baselines in short-term forecasting and capturing long-term dynamical features, generalizing to unseen dynamics.

Conclusion: PHLieNet effectively handles parametric variability, enabling unified modeling of diverse system behaviors with superior performance.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression aims to learn interpretable functions with small prediction errors by searching spaces of small expressions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to achieve interpretable functions with minimal prediction errors, which standard regression methods fail to address due to their reliance on basis function expansions.

Method: Systematically search spaces of small symbolic expressions instead of optimizing parameters of basis functions.

Result: Systematic search yields more accurate and robust solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in recovering true underlying expressions.

Conclusion: Focusing on small expressions in symbolic regression improves accuracy and robustness, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty calibration affects perturbation-based explanations in ML models, introduces ReCalX to improve explanation reliability, and validates its effectiveness with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of perturbation-based explanations due to poor model behavior under specific perturbations and misaligned confidence estimates.

Method: Introduces ReCalX, a recalibration approach for models to enhance explanation quality without altering original predictions.

Result: Experiments show ReCalX improves explanation alignment with human perception and actual object locations.

Conclusion: ReCalX effectively addresses the reliability issues in perturbation-based explanations by improving model calibration.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and coherent forecasting across temporal scales is essential for business decision-making but remains challenging.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical architecture with specialized modules for different temporal aggregation levels, encoding average behavior in hidden layers.

Result: Validated on the M5 dataset, the architecture outperforms established methods like TSMixer.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses the challenge of coherent forecasting across temporal hierarchies.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse
and fine temporal scales is crucial for profit-optimized decision-making in
several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the out-of-distribution problem in offline RL by analyzing the impact of batch data on performance and proposing UDG for unsupervised data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from out-of-distribution issues, and existing work overlooks the role of batch data. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Theoretical analysis links batch data distribution to offline RL performance. UDG is introduced for unsupervised data generation in task-agnostic settings.

Result: UDG outperforms supervised data generation in solving unknown tasks, minimizing worst-case regret.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of batch data distribution and demonstrates UDG's effectiveness in improving offline RL performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-parallelism in LLMs requires heavy communication for activation synchronization, which is inefficient.

Method: Proposes CAAT-Net, a communication-aware architecture, with minor adjustments to avoid full activation synchronization.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in communication for 1B and 7B parameter models, maintaining pretraining accuracy.

Conclusion: CAAT-Net effectively reduces bandwidth demands and accelerates LLM training and inference.

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to mitigate shortcut learning by optimizing for explanation robustness and feature relevance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by reducing misclassifications by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning, where models rely on irrelevant features, can lead to real-world harms. Existing methods using feature salience annotations are unreliable.

Method: A simplified objective is introduced to optimize explanation robustness and shortcut mitigation, supported by theoretical justification.

Result: The method reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% and is validated across experiments, including NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, with practical insights on annotation quality over quantity, and code is publicly available.

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

*A. A. Balinsky,A. D. Balinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to reuse a single calibration set for reliable uncertainty quantification in machine learning, validated on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ICP requires fresh calibration for each prediction, limiting practicality. The paper aims to reduce this need while maintaining reliability.

Method: Combines e-conformal prediction with Hoeffding's inequality to modify Markov's inequality, enabling single calibration set reuse.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of maintaining provable performance with reduced calibration needs, validated on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The approach enhances practicality of conformal prediction without compromising reliability, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

*Jungwoo Park,Taewhoo Lee,Chanwoong Yoon,Hyeon Hwang,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP) prevents extreme activation outliers in LLMs, improving quantization performance with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme activation outliers in LLMs degrade quantization, hindering efficient on-device deployment.

Method: OSP combines the Muon optimizer, Single-Scale RMSNorm, and learnable embedding projection to prevent outlier formation.

Result: A 1.4B-parameter OSP model achieves a 35.7 average benchmark score under 4-bit quantization, with near-zero excess kurtosis.

Conclusion: Outliers are not inherent to LLMs but result from training strategies; OSP enables more efficient deployment.

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

*Christiaan Lamers,Ahmed Nabil Belbachir,Thomas Bäck,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using lightweight generators based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce memory usage in memory-based continual learning, improving accuracy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize memory footprint while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, as storing all past data is impractical.

Method: Uses SVD-based generators to extract minimal information from data, enhancing methods like A-GEM and Experience Replay.

Result: Significant increase in average accuracy with minimal memory usage, requiring no extra training time.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces memory needs for continual learning, showing promise for practical applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

*Alberto Pirillo,Luca Colombo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReBoot is the first framework enabling fully encrypted, non-interactive training of DNNs using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), achieving accuracy comparable to plaintext training while enhancing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for deep learning methods that protect data privacy during training, overcoming computational and algorithmic challenges of HE-based DNN training.

Method: ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture with local error signals, tailored packing for SIMD operations, and approximate bootstrapping to minimize overhead.

Result: ReBoot achieves accuracy close to plaintext training, improves test accuracy over encrypted logistic regression (+3.27%) and existing DNN frameworks (+6.83%), and reduces training latency by up to 8.83x.

Conclusion: ReBoot successfully enables encrypted DNN training with practical efficiency and accuracy, advancing privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

*Nathan Maurer,Harshal Kaushik,Roshni Anna Jacob,Jie Zhang,Souma Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based method combines crew and power grid networks into a single graph, using reinforcement learning for efficient restoration planning, outperforming random and optimization-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the resilience of critical infrastructure networks by optimizing resource allocation for faster and more effective restoration after disruptions.

Method: Integrates graph reinforcement learning (GRL) with bigraph matching, using graph neural networks trained via Proximal Policy Optimization and Neuroevolution for crew-to-task allocation.

Result: The approach generalizes across scenarios, achieving 3-fold better performance than random policies and outperforming optimization-based solutions in speed and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances restoration planning, offering scalable and efficient solutions for critical infrastructure resilience.

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Tobias Vontobel,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models, revealing its distinct impacts on low and high frequencies. It proposes frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG) to separately scale these frequencies, improving image quality and avoiding CFG drawbacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how CFG enhances quality and alignment in diffusion models and address its limitations like oversaturation and reduced diversity.

Method: Analyzes CFG in the frequency domain, identifies distinct roles of low and high frequencies, and introduces FDG to separately guide them.

Result: FDG improves image quality, avoids oversaturation, and preserves diversity, outperforming CFG in FID and recall metrics.

Conclusion: FDG is a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard CFG, enhancing fidelity and diversity in conditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAP introduces a variational framework using von Mises-Fisher distributions on the unit hypersphere for better uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, improving calibration with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing variational methods use isotropic Gaussian approximations, which poorly match neural network geometry, necessitating a more principled approach.

Method: CAP models weight uncertainties on the unit hypersphere with von Mises-Fisher distributions, linking concentration parameters to activation noise variance via a closed-form KL divergence regularizer.

Result: CAP reduces Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x on CIFAR-10 and provides interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles.

Conclusion: CAP offers a theoretically grounded, practical solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

### [234] [Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19830)
*Yichao Fu,Rui Ge,Zelei Shao,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning introduces step-level parallelism to improve speculative decoding (SD), raising speedup from 1.4x to 2.1x while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level SD's speedup is limited because the correctness of long token drafts decreases exponentially. Lookahead Reasoning aims to overcome this by leveraging step-level parallelism in reasoning models.

Method: A lightweight draft model proposes future steps; the target model expands these in parallel, and a verifier ensures semantic correctness. Token-level SD operates within each step, multiplying parallelism.

Result: Empirical results show speedup improvements from 1.4x to 2.1x across benchmarks like GSM8K and AIME, with better scaling on additional GPU throughput.

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning effectively lifts the algorithmic ceiling of SD, offering higher speedups without compromising answer quality.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

*Shrey Dixit,Kayson Fakhar,Fatemeh Hadaeghi,Patrick Mineault,Konrad P. Kording,Claus C. Hilgetag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSA is a model-agnostic framework for quantifying neural unit contributions in high-dimensional outputs, revealing insights into model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SHAP fail to quantify neural unit contributions across high-dimensional outputs, creating a gap MSA aims to fill.

Method: MSA uses game-theoretic lesioning of unit combinations to produce Shapley Modes, contribution maps matching output dimensionality.

Result: MSA reveals computation hubs, language-specific experts in LLMs, and an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.

Conclusion: MSA is a powerful tool for interpreting, editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

TL;DR: OFTv2 improves upon OFT by reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining performance, enabling efficient finetuning of quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFT's high runtime and memory demands hinder practical deployment, prompting the need for a more efficient adaptation method.

Method: OFTv2 replaces weight-centric computations with input-centric matrix-vector multiplications and introduces the Cayley-Neumann parameterization for efficient orthogonal parameterization.

Result: OFTv2 achieves up to 10x faster training, 3x lower GPU memory usage, and outperforms QLoRA in stability, efficiency, and memory.

Conclusion: OFTv2 offers a scalable and efficient solution for finetuning, including quantized models, addressing OFT's limitations.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT is a preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational analysis to extract salient data features, improving training stability and generalization in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in deep learning lies in preparing minimal, salient input data. Traditional methods struggle with noise and irrelevant features.

Method: DRIFT projects data onto low-dimensional vibration mode shapes of plates, creating a compact, interpretable representation.

Result: DRIFT achieves competitive accuracy with fewer input dimensions (~50 for MNIST, <100 for CIFAR100) and outperforms pixel-based models and PCA in stability and robustness.

Conclusion: DRIFT highlights the importance of input curation and physics-driven transformations for enhancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

*Yihong Luo,Shuchen Xue,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise Consistency Training (NCT) enables efficient integration of new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without retraining, achieving high-quality controllable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently adapting one-step generators to new control conditions without costly modifications or retraining.

Method: Introduces an adapter module and noise consistency loss to align generation behavior with new controls.

Result: NCT outperforms existing methods in generation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: NCT is a lightweight, modular, and effective solution for controllable content generation.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores online convex optimization on ℓp-balls for p>2, showing a shift in optimal regret between high- and low-dimensional settings. It proves FTRL with adaptive regularization is optimal, while fixed regularization fails. Lower bounds for linear bandits in high dimensions are also provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the optimal regret bounds in online convex optimization across different dimension regimes (high vs. low) and determine if fixed regularization can achieve anytime optimality.

Method: Uses Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularization adaptive to dimension regimes and analyzes separable regularizers.

Result: FTRL with adaptive regularization is anytime optimal, but fixed regularization is sub-optimal in one regime. Lower bounds show no sub-linear regret for linear bandits in high dimensions.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization is necessary for optimal performance, and fixed regularization cannot achieve anytime optimality across all dimension regimes.

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-regularization automates regularization tuning by using validation gradients during training, balancing complexity and overfitting without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of regularization parameters is time-consuming and suboptimal. Cross-regularization aims to automate this process for better model performance.

Method: The method splits parameter optimization: training data guides feature learning, while validation data shapes regularization. It uses noise injection in neural networks for implementation.

Result: The approach achieves provable convergence to cross-validation optima, reveals high noise tolerance, and architecture-specific regularization.

Conclusion: Cross-regularization offers efficient, automated regularization tuning, integrates with other techniques, and maintains training efficiency.

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a framework extending Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to handle multiple human preference dimensions dynamically, improving flexibility and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment techniques like RLHF are computationally intensive and unstable, while DPO assumes a single static preference distribution, limiting flexibility for multi-objective or dynamic settings.

Method: The proposed framework extends DPO to incorporate multiple preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness) and enables dynamic interpolation via a controllable simplex-weighted formulation, supporting listwise preference feedback.

Result: Empirical and theoretical analysis shows the method matches DPO's effectiveness on static objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses limitations of existing alignment techniques, providing a more flexible and adaptable solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: A new adaptive weighting scheme for PINNs improves accuracy by adjusting loss function weights from isolated points to continuous regions, reducing relative L² errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face challenges in convergence and accuracy due to optimization with finite points. The study aims to address this limitation.

Method: Proposed an adaptive weighting scheme for loss functions, transitioning weights from isolated points to their continuous neighborhoods.

Result: The scheme effectively reduces relative L² errors, demonstrating improved accuracy.

Conclusion: The adaptive weighting method enhances PINN performance in solving PDEs by addressing computational constraints.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

Motivation: To address scenarios where learners can produce multiple predictions, ensuring correctness if at least one label is correct and none are 'predictably wrong,' applicable to dynamical systems, recommendations, and compression.

Method: Introduces ambiguous online learning with multi-valued hypotheses, defining correctness and 'predictably wrong' labels. Analyzes mistake bounds for hypothesis classes.

Result: Demonstrates a trichotomy of optimal mistake bounds: Θ(1), Θ(√N), or N, up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The ambiguous online learning framework is versatile, with clear bounds on mistakes, making it useful for practical applications like recommendations and compression.

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

### [244] [Curating art exhibitions using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19813)
*Eurico Covas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models mimic human art curators by learning from past exhibitions, achieving reasonable accuracy without large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI can replicate the subjective art curation process of human experts by learning from historical exhibition data.

Method: Developed four machine learning models trained on 25 years of Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibitions, focusing on feature engineering and model architecture.

Result: Models replicated past exhibitions with accuracy above random, showing potential without relying on large language models.

Conclusion: AI can approximate human curatorial judgment, and with more data, could match it more closely.

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

*Miles Wang,Tom Dupré la Tour,Olivia Watkins,Alex Makelov,Ryan A. Chi,Samuel Miserendino,Johannes Heidecke,Tejal Patwardhan,Dan Mossing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates emergent misalignment in language models, showing it occurs across diverse conditions and can be mitigated with minimal benign fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models generalize behaviors from training to deployment, particularly focusing on emergent misalignment caused by fine-tuning on insecure code.

Method: Extends prior work by testing emergent misalignment in various scenarios (reinforcement learning, synthetic datasets, models without safety training) and uses model diffing with sparse autoencoders to analyze internal representations.

Result: Identifies 'misaligned persona' features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature that predicts misalignment. Shows misalignment can be mitigated with a few hundred benign samples.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is a widespread issue, but targeted fine-tuning can effectively restore model alignment.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

*Marc-Antoine Coulombe,Maxime Berger,Antoine Lesage-Landry*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A BiLSTM-PINN model is proposed for simulating power electronics, outperforming FCNN in accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for fast, accurate power electronics simulation tools beyond traditional physics-based methods.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed BiLSTM neural network (BiLSTM-PINN) and compares it with FCNN and BiLSTM models using step-response tests.

Result: BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM outperform FCNN by 9x and 4.5x in median RMSE, with lower standard deviations.

Conclusion: BiLSTM-PINN is a promising alternative for power electronics simulations, combining speed and accuracy.

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

TL;DR: ProxelGen is a protein structure generative model using 3D density representations (proxels) instead of point clouds, achieving higher novelty and better FID scores than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable new tasks and flexible conditioning capabilities by representing proteins as voxelized densities rather than point clouds.

Method: Uses a 3D CNN-based VAE with a diffusion model on its latent space to generate proteins encoded as proxels.

Result: Achieves higher novelty, better FID scores, and comparable designability to the training set. Excels in motif scaffolding and flexible shape conditioning.

Conclusion: ProxelGen demonstrates the advantages of 3D density-based generation for protein design, offering improved performance and versatility.

Abstract: We develop ProxelGen, a protein structure generative model that operates on
3D densities as opposed to the prevailing 3D point cloud representations.
Representing proteins as voxelized densities, or proxels, enables new tasks and
conditioning capabilities. We generate proteins encoded as proxels via a 3D
CNN-based VAE in conjunction with a diffusion model operating on its latent
space. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProxelGen's samples achieve higher
novelty, better FID scores, and the same level of designability as the training
set. ProxelGen's advantages are demonstrated in a standard motif scaffolding
benchmark, and we show how 3D density-based generation allows for more flexible
shape conditioning.

### [248] [A standard transformer and attention with linear biases for molecular conformer generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19834)
*Viatcheslav Gurev,Timothy Rumbell*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: A standard transformer with relative positional encoding outperforms larger non-equivariant models in generating molecular conformations, using a method inspired by ALiBi from NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the size limitations of non-equivariant models in generating molecular conformations by leveraging positional encoding.

Method: Implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias based on shortest path distances between graph nodes, inspired by ALiBi in NLP.

Result: The model with 25M parameters surpassed a 64M parameter non-equivariant model on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark.

Conclusion: This approach can serve as a foundation for new generative models for molecular conformations.

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

TL;DR: Kling-Foley is a multimodal Video-to-Audio generation model using diffusion transformers, visual semantic representation, and audio-visual synchronization modules to produce high-quality, synchronized audio. It introduces a universal latent audio codec and a stereo rendering method, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize high-quality audio synchronized with video content by leveraging multimodal interactions and improving alignment capabilities.

Method: Uses multimodal diffusion transformers, visual semantic representation, and audio-visual synchronization modules. Introduces a universal latent audio codec and stereo rendering.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment, and audio quality.

Conclusion: Kling-Foley effectively generates video-matching sound effects with high synchronization and quality, supported by a new benchmark.

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A study compares captioning strategies for robotic scene understanding, evaluating models like BLIP and VLMs on tabletop scenes, highlighting trade-offs between single/multi-view captioning and real-world vs. 3D printed objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic scene understanding by evaluating how well vision-language models (VLMs) generate descriptions of tabletop scenes from multiple viewpoints.

Method: The robot captures images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and various captioning models (e.g., BLIP, VLMs) are evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and naturalness.

Result: VLMs perform well for common objects but struggle with novel representations. Multi-view captioning shows trade-offs compared to single-view.

Conclusion: VLMs are practical for robotic settings with common objects but lack generalization to novel cases, offering insights for deploying foundation models in real-world robotics.

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

*Christopher Agia,Rohan Sinha,Jingyun Yang,Rika Antonova,Marco Pavone,Haruki Nishimura,Masha Itkina,Jeannette Bohg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CUPID is a robot data curation method for imitation learning, ranking demonstrations by their impact on policy performance, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how individual demonstrations affect policy outcomes in imitation learning is challenging. CUPID addresses this by quantifying each demonstration's influence.

Method: CUPID uses influence function theory to estimate each training demonstration's impact on policy performance, enabling data curation by filtering harmful or selecting beneficial demonstrations.

Result: CUPID improves policy performance with less data (e.g., 33% curated data achieves state-of-the-art results) and enhances robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: CUPID effectively curates imitation learning data, optimizing policy performance and generalizability, with demonstrated success in simulations and hardware.

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AnchorDP3 is a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic manipulation, achieving high success rates in randomized environments through innovations like semantic segmentation, task-conditioned feature encoders, and affordance-anchored keypose diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of robotic manipulation in highly randomized environments, AnchorDP3 aims to simplify prediction spaces and improve accuracy by leveraging affordance priors and geometric consistency.

Method: The framework integrates Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, and Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion to process point clouds and predict sparse, meaningful actions.

Result: AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark under extreme randomization, demonstrating high performance.

Conclusion: AnchorDP3 shows potential for fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies without human demonstrations, advancing robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CronusVLA extends single-frame vision-language-action models to multi-frame observation, improving efficiency and performance by leveraging motion features and reducing redundant computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models are limited by single-frame observations, missing motion information from multi-frame data due to high computational costs.

Method: CronusVLA uses single-frame pretraining, multi-frame encoding for motion features, and cross-frame decoding with cross-attention. It also includes an action adaptation mechanism.

Result: Achieves 70.9% success rate on SimplerEnv, 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO, and strong real-world performance.

Conclusion: CronusVLA efficiently integrates multi-frame observations, enhancing VLA model performance and robustness.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built on pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across
manipulation tasks. However, they remain constrained by a single-frame
observation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information
offered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large
vision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and
inference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends
single-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient
post-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame
pretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens
prediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)
multi-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from
discrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating
motion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame
decoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared
decoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and
caching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an
application of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation
mechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during
finetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with
70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world
Franka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness.

Abstract: In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments such as

improved robustness under various conditions, achieving positioning accuracy
improvements of approximately 88% on average. This work highlights the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized UAVs face challenges in flight dynamics and power, limiting their autonomy and mission capabilities. This work aims to overcome these by improving 3D reconstruction quality.

Method: The authors design an N3DR-based pipeline using models like Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, tested against SfM for 3D reconstruction from UAV-captured images.

Result: The N3DR pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, enabling high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates N3DR's potential to advance miniaturized UAV capabilities, particularly for precise 3D tasks.

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized TLG model called receptron, which uses nonlinear input-dependent weight functions to enhance classification performance, even with a single unit, and demonstrates its selective activation properties for analog inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of linear TLGs in classification tasks, the authors propose a generalized model (receptron) to improve performance without requiring complex networks.

Method: The receptron model employs nonlinear input-dependent weight functions and is analyzed for selective activation properties in cubic domains of a 3D space, extendable to n-dimensions.

Result: The receptron exhibits intrinsic selective activation for analog inputs, suggesting its potential for high-selectivity edge applications without complex training.

Conclusion: Receptron-based networks could form a new class of devices for managing analog inputs with high selectivity and classification capabilities, simplifying edge applications.

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

### [259] [Which Company Adjustment Matter? Insights from Uplift Modeling on Financial Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19049)
*Xinlin Wang,Mats Brorsson*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper applies uplift modeling to analyze the impact of company adjustments on financial status, introducing a new framework (MTDnet) for time-dependent treatments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uplift models often simplify treatments as binary or multiple, but company adjustments are complex, time-dependent actions requiring a specialized approach.

Method: The study uses meta-learners and uplift models for binary treatments, then proposes MTDnet for time-dependent adjustments, tested on Luxembourg financial data.

Result: Experiments show the necessity of considering treatment timing, with MTDnet outperforming traditional models for time-dependent adjustments.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of temporal order in uplift modeling for company adjustments and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MTDnet framework.

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

### [260] [First-Order Sparse Convex Optimization: Better Rates with Sparse Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19075)
*Dan Garber*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper shows that sparse updates can achieve linear convergence rates with improved condition numbers, reducing runtime and simplifying implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for convex optimization with sparse solutions improve convergence rates but not runtime per iteration, which remains high for high-dimensional problems.

Method: Proposes using sparse updates to leverage sparsity, improving both convergence rates and runtime.

Result: Linear convergence rates with improved condition numbers are achieved, along with reduced runtime and easier implementation.

Conclusion: Sparse updates offer a practical and efficient solution for convex optimization with sparse optimal solutions.

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper reviews multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) from a task-agnostic perspective, addressing gaps in existing surveys by covering diverse methods like multi-modal, multi-agent, time-series, and LLM fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSFP surveys are limited to single tasks or perspectives, hindering broader applicability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive, task-agnostic review.

Method: The paper organizes MSFP research by introducing its background, reviewing multi-modal and multi-agent fusion, analyzing time-series fusion, and investigating multimodal LLM fusion.

Result: A detailed survey of MSFP methods is presented, highlighting diverse technical approaches and their applications.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges and future directions, aiming to aid researchers in understanding MSFP progress and inspiring future work.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

### [262] [On the efficacy of old features for the detection of new bots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19635)
*Rocco De Nicola,Marinella Petrocchi,Manuel Pratelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores bot detection on Twitter, comparing four feature sets to identify evolved bots, suggesting cost-effective methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting malicious bots that manipulate public opinion, despite existing solutions.

Method: Compare four feature sets, including Botometer scores, profile/timeline data, and Twitter client info, on six datasets.

Result: Findings suggest general-purpose classifiers and low-cost features can effectively detect evolved bots.

Conclusion: Cost-effective methods may suffice for detecting sophisticated bots, offering practical solutions for online platforms.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

*Yubeen Bae,Minchan Kim,Jaejin Lee,Sangbum Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Yejin Choi,Niloofar Mireshghallah*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combines powerful untrusted LLMs with local models to process private data securely, improving performance while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between using powerful but untrusted LLMs for sensitive data and weaker local models, ensuring privacy without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: untrusted LLMs generate prompts and sub-queries, while encrypted semantic search retrieves private data for local model processing.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o alone by 7.1 percentage points on the LoCoMo benchmark, demonstrating effective privacy-preserving task decomposition.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances privacy and performance, paving the way for secure hybrid LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

*Valerii Gakh,Hayretdin Bahsi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates prompt injection attacks in LLM-based applications, focusing on prompt leak detection techniques. It evaluates open-source solutions (LLM Guard, Vigil, Rebuff) and proposes improvements for their weaknesses. Vigil is best for minimal false positives, while Rebuff suits average needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks threaten the security of LLM-based applications, and existing defenses are insufficient. The study aims to evaluate and improve prompt leak detection techniques.

Method: Analyzed distinct prompt leakage detection techniques and compared open-source solutions (LLM Guard, Vigil, Rebuff). Identified strengths, weaknesses, and proposed improvements.

Result: Vigil is optimal for minimal false positives, Rebuff for average needs. Canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were ineffective; Rebuff had an evasion weakness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved prompt leak detection techniques and provides insights for optimal deployment of existing solutions.

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A systematic literature review (SLR) on adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) in cyber-physical systems (CPS) from 2013-2023, analyzing 65 papers and introducing a novel taxonomy. Highlights gaps in research and provides future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting evolving cyberattacks in CPS are limited, focusing on past threats. AAD offers promise but lacks comprehensive review.

Method: Conducted an SLR on 397 papers, systematically analyzing 65 (47 research, 18 survey). Introduced a taxonomy covering attack types, CPS applications, learning paradigms, data management, and algorithms.

Result: Reviewed works often focused on single aspects of adaptation (data or model), rarely both. Identified gaps in research and state-of-the-art limitations.

Conclusion: Provides insights for researchers and practitioners, offering recommendations to advance AAD in CPS.

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot
be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data
processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature
extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.
We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,
and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed
works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the
art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A survey categorizes and benchmarks synthetic image generation methods for privacy-preserving data synthesis, evaluating utility-privacy tradeoffs using model-agnostic membership inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods for privacy-preserving data synthesis, especially in the context of training classifiers.

Method: Systematically categorize methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along the generation-sampling-classification pipeline. Benchmark generative methods and use MIAs to measure privacy risk.

Result: Empirical comparison provides insights into utility-privacy tradeoffs, answering critical questions about synthetic data's effectiveness and optimal release strategies.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable insights and guidance for choosing optimal synthetic data generation methods and release strategies in real-world applications.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image
generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field
lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation
methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic
images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of
generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and
outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically
categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations
along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare
diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative
generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs)
as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical
questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which
release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the
utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different
scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides
actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data
generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies
for real-world applications.

*Murtaza Rangwala,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes topology-based privacy leaks in federated learning, showing adversaries can infer sensitive data even with strong privacy measures. It proposes and tests attack vectors and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied privacy risks posed by network topology knowledge in federated learning systems.

Method: Analyzed 4,720 attack instances across six adversarial knowledge scenarios, proposing three attack vectors and testing structural noise injection as a defense.

Result: Attack success rates reached 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge, with 80% of partial knowledge scenarios remaining effective. Structural noise injection reduced attacks by up to 51.4%.

Conclusion: Network topology is a critical privacy vulnerability in federated learning, but topology-aware defenses like noise injection can mitigate risks.

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

*Ye Tian,Zhang Yumin,Yifan Jia,Jianguo Sun,Yanbin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WebGuard++ addresses shortcomings in malicious URL detection by fusing URL and HTML features hierarchically, using bidirectional coupling and interpretable substructures, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks robust URL modeling, suffers from HTML graph sparsity, ignores bidirectional URL-HTML interactions, and provides opaque decisions, limiting detection accuracy.

Method: WebGuard++ introduces a cross-scale URL encoder, subgraph-aware HTML encoder, bidirectional coupling module, and voting module for localized malicious region detection.

Result: WebGuard++ achieves 1.1x-7.9x higher true positive rates at low false positive rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines URL and HTML features, improving malicious URL detection with interpretable and bidirectional analysis.

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivacyXray detects privacy breaches in LLMs by analyzing inner states, achieving 92.69% accuracy without relying on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about private information leaks in LLMs during inference, with no existing datasets for validation, drive the need for a detection framework.

Method: PrivacyXray uses four metrics (semantic similarity, probability distributions) to analyze LLM inner states, synthesizing realistic private data for validation.

Result: Achieves 92.69% accuracy, a 20.06% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating stability and practicality.

Conclusion: PrivacyXray effectively addresses privacy detection challenges in LLMs, offering a reliable and dataset-independent solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

*Saeed Mahloujifar,Chuan Guo,G. Edward Suh,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature Differential Privacy (FDP), a refined version of DP, to protect specific attributes in machine learning, improving utility without sacrificing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP can degrade utility unnecessarily when only specific attributes need protection. FDP addresses this by offering a more flexible privacy framework.

Method: FDP is simulation-based, supports addition/removal/replacement variants, and adaptively separates protected/non-protected features. A modified DP-SGD algorithm is proposed for FDP.

Result: FDP significantly improves utility (e.g., FID from 286.7 to 101.9 at ε=8 for diffusion models) while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FDP provides a practical approach to reduce the utility cost of DP in scenarios where only specific attributes require protection.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

Motivation: The need for reliable inferential tools for practitioners using optimal transport maps, which efficiently rearrange mass between distributions.

Result: Summarized progress in understanding and applying OT maps, highlighting gaps and opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: Key directions for future research are identified to enhance practical applications of optimal transport maps.

Abstract: In many applications of optimal transport (OT), the object of primary
interest is the optimal transport map. This map rearranges mass from one
probability distribution to another in the most efficient way possible by
minimizing a specified cost. In this paper we review recent advances in
estimating and developing limit theorems for the OT map, using samples from the
underlying distributions. We also review parallel lines of work that establish
similar results for special cases and variants of the basic OT setup. We
conclude with a discussion of key directions for future research with the goal
of providing practitioners with reliable inferential tools.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: AMBer is a reinforcement learning framework for efficiently constructing particle physics models by selecting symmetry groups and particle content, validated in known and novel theory spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast landscape of particle physics models requires intuitive and labor-intensive construction, prompting the need for an automated approach.

Method: AMBer uses reinforcement learning to interact with a physics software pipeline, selecting symmetry groups, particle content, and representations while minimizing free parameters.

Result: Validated in known theory spaces and extended to a novel symmetry group, demonstrating viability.

Conclusion: AMBer's approach can be extended to other theoretical model-building problems beyond neutrino flavor theories.

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning

TL;DR: BIRD-CRITIC and Six-Gym address SQL debugging challenges with benchmarks and training methods, outperforming proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack rigorous evaluation for SQL debugging, a critical bottleneck in database applications.

Method: Introduces BIRD-CRITIC benchmarks and Six-Gym training environment with SQL-Rewind and f-Plan Boosting.

Result: Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing proprietary models.

Conclusion: The work democratizes SQL-debugging capabilities, advancing open-source models for database tasks.

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

TL;DR: Introduces higher-order graph databases (HO-GDBs) to support complex interactions beyond first-order relations, improving tasks like subgraph counting and graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph databases lack support for higher-order interactions, limiting their utility for advanced analytics.

Method: Proposes HO-GDBs using lifting and lowering paradigms, with a theoretical analysis and a lightweight, modular prototype.

Result: The prototype scales well, improves graph neural network accuracy by 44%, and ensures low latency and high throughput.

Conclusion: HO-GDBs effectively extend traditional graph databases, enabling scalable and efficient higher-order analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional keyword-based search engines fail to address complex, multi-step information needs, necessitating a new paradigm.

Method: The paper proposes Agentic Deep Research, combining autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and synthesis in a dynamic feedback loop, supported by a test-time scaling law.

Result: Benchmark results show Agentic Deep Research significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: Agentic Deep Research is poised to dominate future information seeking, with resources available for community use.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,
including industry products, research papers, benchmark datasets, and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the dual challenge of high accuracy in interpreting user queries and efficient processing of large product catalogs in e-commerce IR systems.

Method: Proposes NEAR², a Nested Embedding Approach for Retrieval and Ranking, using multiple loss functions like negative ranking loss and contrastive loss on diverse test sets.

Result: Achieves 12x efficiency in embedding size at inference, no extra training cost, and improved accuracy over smaller embedding dimensions.

Conclusion: NEAR² outperforms existing models in efficiency and accuracy for e-commerce IR tasks.

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

*Yang Liu,Feng Wu,Xuefang Zhu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FairGENRec, a diffusion model-based recommendation system, enhances fairness and diversity by mitigating bias from sensitive user features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address recommendation unfairness caused by correlations between user behavior and sensitive features like gender and age.

Method: Uses a diffusion model to inject noise and reconstruct item sequences, incorporating multi-interests to eliminate bias.

Result: Improves both accuracy and fairness in recommendations, validated on three datasets.

Conclusion: FairGENRec effectively balances recommendation quality and fairness, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Reptile automates the conversion of RegExes to Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL) using rule-based and GPT-4 optimization, achieving 73.7% safe conversion and high accuracy (F1-score/MCC > 0.91).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual conversion of RegExes to DPL is costly and error-prone, hindering migration to modern log analytics platforms.

Method: Combines rule-based RegEx-to-DPL conversion with GPT-4 optimization for cases where full conversion is impossible.

Result: 73.7% safe conversion rate for 946 RegExes; F1-score and MCC > 0.91 for 23 real-world RegExes.

Conclusion: Reptile is effective for automating RegEx-to-DPL conversion, aiding companies in migrating to platforms like Dynatrace.

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

*Yuanyuan Zhang,Haocheng Zhao,Sijie Xiong,Rui Yang,Eng Gee Lim,Yutao Yue*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm and a transfer learning model (RFcardi) to recover ECG from radar signals in new scenarios with limited data, achieving high-quality results with minimal training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of high-quality radar signal dependency and large training datasets for ECG recovery in new scenarios.

Method: Introduces CFT for precise cardiac location tracking and RFcardi, a transfer learning model, to extract cardio-related information from radar signals without ECG ground truth, requiring few training pairs.

Result: CFT dynamically identifies cardiac locations, and RFcardi generates accurate ECG recoveries with minimal training data.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient ECG recovery in data-scarce scenarios, with code and dataset availability post-publication.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop EEG models that generalize across tasks and individuals, and identify biomarkers for mental health diagnosis and personalized treatment.

Method: Two challenges: Transfer (zero-shot decoding) and Psychopathology factor prediction. Uses a high-density EEG dataset (128 channels) from 3,000+ subjects. Provides neural network baselines.

Result: Aims to spur advances in computational psychiatry, neurotechnology, and clinical research by improving EEG model generalization and mental health prediction.

Conclusion: The competition could lead to breakthroughs in neuroscience and clinical applications, fostering computational psychiatry and personalized treatments.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

### [281] [Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451)
*Seunghun Lee,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Hyuncheol Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemPA-Look, a framework for optimizing token packetization to preserve semantics in token communication under outage channels, achieving high performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token communication is vulnerable to outage channels due to inter-token dependency, where losing a single token can distort message semantics. This motivates optimizing token packetization to preserve semantics.

Method: Proposes SemPA-Look, a framework using residual semantic score (RSS) and lookahead search to optimize token grouping, achieving linear complexity.

Result: SemPA-Look achieves high average token similarity (ATS) and LPIPS scores, comparable to exhaustive search, with up to 40x lower complexity. It also outperforms genetic algorithms by 10x in complexity.

Conclusion: SemPA-Look is practical for remote AI-generated content and token communication applications, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

*Vincent Leon,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper addresses online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, proposing a dynamic VCG mechanism and an online RL algorithm to achieve efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works treat sequential auctions as episodic or bandit problems, ignoring continuous market evolution. This paper aims to model a more realistic setting where the market evolves without resetting.

Method: The paper extends the VCG mechanism to sequential auctions and develops an online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the MDP model and implement a dynamic mechanism.

Result: The learned mechanism asymptotically converges to a dynamic VCG-like mechanism, satisfying efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality with high probability, while achieving guaranteed regret performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully adapts static auction properties to dynamic settings, offering a practical solution for sequential auctions in evolving markets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

Motivation: To address conceptual confusion between AI Safety and AI Security, ensuring precise research directions and trustworthy AI deployment.

Method: Rigorous definitions, analogies from message transmission and building construction, and exploration of interdependencies.

Result: Clear delineation of AI Safety and AI Security boundaries, highlighting their interdependency and implications.

Conclusion: Clarifying these distinctions is vital for research, collaboration, policy, and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large class sizes in computer science courses reduce student engagement with instructors and material. Advances in LLMs like ChatGPT offer a solution.

Method: A within-subject study in a software engineering course compared engagement in activities with and without ChatGPT.

Result: ChatGPT improved student engagement with learning content in large classes.

Conclusion: CAI tools like ChatGPT can effectively support engagement in large classrooms, with implications for future educational practices.

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper advocates for clear boundaries in LLM-based social simulations to enhance their reliability for social science research, addressing limitations like behavioral homogeneity and proposing heuristic guidelines for alignment, consistency, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in social simulations, particularly their tendency towards an 'average persona' lacking behavioral heterogeneity, which hinders reliable social pattern discovery.

Method: Examines three boundary problems (alignment, consistency, robustness) and proposes heuristic boundaries and a practical checklist for researchers.

Result: Suggests LLM-based simulations are more reliable when focusing on collective patterns, aligning with real population averages, and employing proper validation methods.

Conclusion: Clear boundaries and guidelines are essential for LLM-based social simulations to meaningfully contribute to social science research.

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

### [288] [Assessing Risk of Stealing Proprietary Models for Medical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19464)
*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores model stealing (MS) attacks on black-box medical imaging models, proposing a two-step method called QueryWise to enhance MS with limited queries, validated on Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks, but their susceptibility is understudied, especially under realistic constraints like limited query budgets and no access to training data.

Method: The study investigates MS attacks using publicly available datasets and introduces QueryWise, a two-step approach leveraging unlabeled proxy data to train thief models without extra queries.

Result: QueryWise effectively clones medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification, demonstrating the feasibility of MS attacks in this domain.

Conclusion: Medical imaging models are vulnerable to MS attacks even with limited queries, highlighting the need for robust defenses to protect proprietary diagnostic tools.

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NIC-RobustBench is the first open-source framework for evaluating neural image compression (NIC) robustness and adversarial defenses, offering scalability and comprehensive codec support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate NIC robustness and adversarial defenses due to the rise of JPEG AI and limited prior research on diverse codecs and attacks.

Method: Development of NIC-RobustBench, a scalable framework with extensive codec support, to assess NIC robustness and defense efficiency alongside Rate-Distortion performance.

Result: NIC-RobustBench provides the largest codec library for NIC robustness evaluation and demonstrates its utility in analyzing NIC robustness.

Conclusion: NIC-RobustBench addresses gaps in NIC robustness research, offering a versatile tool for future studies and practical applications.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area
of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models
(LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for
end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating
NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research
has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we
present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate
NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing
Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of
codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper
demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and
employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at

*Zefan Yang,Xinrui Song,Xuanang Xu,Yongyi Shi,Ge Wang,Mannudeep K. Kalra,Pingkun Yan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Xray2Xray, a novel World Model, learns 3D structural information from 2D chest X-rays to improve disease diagnosis and risk prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D chest X-rays suffer from structural superposition, limiting their diagnostic precision. This study aims to overcome this by extracting 3D structural information from 2D images.

Method: Xray2Xray uses a vision model and transition model to learn latent representations of chest volume from X-ray projections at different angles. These representations are applied to risk prediction and disease diagnosis tasks.

Result: Xray2Xray outperformed supervised and self-supervised methods in cardiovascular risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in pathology classification. It also reconstructed volumetric context effectively.

Conclusion: Xray2Xray demonstrates the potential of leveraging latent 3D representations from 2D X-rays for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and risk prediction.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and
play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images,
CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their
effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the
limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model
that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from
chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume
by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different
angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the
latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease
diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both
supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular
disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying
five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent
representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent
representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.

*Umair Khan,Jouni Härkönen,Marjukka Friman,Leena Latonen,Teijo Kuopio,Pekka Ruusuvuori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses stain variation in H&E-stained tissue images, introduces a multi-center dataset, and evaluates eight normalization methods to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stain variation in H&E-stained tissues complicates pathologists' and AI-based analysis, necessitating computational solutions.

Method: A multi-center dataset was created with constant factors except staining. Eight normalization methods (four traditional, two deep learning-based) were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.

Result: The study provides insights into stain normalization methods' performance and highlights the dataset's potential for improving model generalizability.

Conclusion: The dataset and evaluation of normalization methods offer valuable tools for addressing stain variation and enhancing AI-based tissue analysis.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for
decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary,
often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both
pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation
computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this
problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein
tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to
66 different labs for routine H&E staining. To isolate staining variation,
other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we
used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different
stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely,
histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep
learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants
each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the
performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation
could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied
training data

### [292] [NAADA: A Noise-Aware Attention Denoising Autoencoder for Dental Panoramic Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19387)
*Khuram Naveed,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise-aware self-attention method (NAADA) to improve fine detail recovery in dental radiographs, outperforming heavier methods like Uformer and MResDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DAEs and CNNs recover low-frequency features better than high-frequency details, losing crucial fine details in dental radiographs. Self-attention mechanisms often overlook noisy regions.

Method: Introduces a noise-aware self-attention method and the NAADA network to focus on and recover key features in noisy regions.

Result: NAADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Uformer, MResDNN) in reconstructing fine details, enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed noise-aware self-attention method effectively addresses the limitation of conventional DAEs, improving detail recovery in dental radiographs.

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

### [293] [A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19167)
*Benjamin Graham*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast, volumetric deep learning model (FLIR) is proposed for cardiac image registration, achieving high accuracy and speed for quantifying cardiac strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration in cardiac analysis is challenging due to lack of ground truth and slow unsupervised methods. Fast, accurate methods are needed for clinical adoption.

Method: The FLIR model uses an efficient convolutional architecture for volumetric registration, enabling rapid inference while maintaining accuracy.

Result: FLIR achieves consistent strain measurements, showing small differences in repeated acquisitions, indicating high reliability.

Conclusion: FLIR offers a fast, accurate solution for cardiac image registration, suitable for research and clinical use.

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

*Xinke Ma,Yongsheng Pan,Qingjie Zeng,Mengkang Lu,Bolysbek Murat Yerzhanuly,Bazargul Matkerim,Yong Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EASR-DCN, a novel ROI-based method for deformable medical image registration, improving accuracy by independently aligning ROIs without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based DMIR methods either ignore ROI representation or rely heavily on labels, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses a Gaussian mixture model for ROI representation and a Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) for independent ROI alignment, integrating results into a displacement vector field.

Result: EASR-DCN outperforms VoxelMorph with Dice score improvements of 10.31% (brain MRI), 13.01% (cardiac MRI), and 5.75% (hippocampus MRI).

Conclusion: EASR-DCN shows superior accuracy and deformation reduction, promising for clinical applications.

Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent
alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable
medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods
have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and
proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods
heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named
EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and
achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels.
Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to
represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process
these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI.
The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a
comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed
on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and
deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our
EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI,
13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its
promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in digital pathology is promising but challenged by unique image characteristics like large size and stain variability.

Method: Evaluated 20+ methods on five datasets, analyzing impacts of image scale, anomaly types, and training strategies.

Result: Detailed comparison of method strengths and limitations, providing a benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: The study offers a comprehensive benchmark to advance anomaly detection in digital pathology.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect
inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In
digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for
applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and
biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images,
such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and
repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection
algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over
20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive
experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and
synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments
investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training
epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a
detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a
comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for
digital pathology images.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes scalable image compression methods (FR-ICMH and PR-ICMH) integrating residual compression to enhance efficiency and interpretability for both human and machine vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing need for scalable image compression serving both human and machine vision, while improving coding efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Introduces Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH), leveraging residual compression mechanisms.

Result: PR-ICMH achieves up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over prior work, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer flexibility and efficiency, making them adaptable for diverse applications in scalable image compression.

Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs
multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years,
images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image
recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image
compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many
existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image
compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully
designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant
on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently
considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and
interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual
compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding
methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:
Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based
Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various
machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between
encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse
application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over
the previous work.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores optimal methods for explicit alignment in mammography for breast cancer risk prediction, comparing input space vs. representation space alignment and joint optimization. It finds image-level alignment superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve breast cancer risk prediction by leveraging temporal mammogram data and optimizing alignment methods.

Method: Compares explicit alignment strategies (input vs. representation space) and joint optimization with risk prediction. Uses deformable registration for alignment.

Result: Image-level alignment outperforms representation-level, improving deformation field quality and risk prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Jointly learning alignment in representation space trades off alignment quality and predictive performance; image-level alignment is better.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection.
Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust
screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on
current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of
screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial
alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have
emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and
implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former
providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in
mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into
where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space)
and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We
demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space
while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current
state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and
predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to
representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and
enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at

### [298] [Angio-Diff: Learning a Self-Supervised Adversarial Diffusion Model for Angiographic Geometry Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19455)
*Zhifeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Xin Wen,Chenyang Zhu,Kai Xu,Kunlun He*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A self-supervised diffusion model (Angio-Diff) is proposed to transform non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, addressing data shortages and improving geometric accuracy in vessel synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vascular diseases require detailed imaging, but angiographic X-rays expose patients to high radiation. Modality translation from non-angiographic to angiographic X-rays is needed, but data-driven methods lack paired datasets and struggle with vessel geometry.

Method: The method uses a diffusion model to learn vascular data distribution, a generator for synthesis, and a mask-based adversarial module. A parametric vascular model enhances geometric accuracy.

Result: Angio-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography quality and accurately captures vessel geometry, validated through comparative and ablation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline and synthetic dataset advance X-ray angiography synthesis, offering a solution to data shortages and geometric challenges in vessel imaging.

Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray
angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for
detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose
personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,
which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to
angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by
the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making
high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We
find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and
struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,
resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as
disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a
self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic
X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven
approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution
of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a
mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a
parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels.
The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray
angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to
evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more
accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels. The code is
available at https://github.com/zfw-cv/AngioDiff.

*Joris Wuts,Jakub Ceranka,Nicolas Michoux,Frédéric Lecouvet,Jef Vandemeulebroucke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for segmenting metastatic bone disease in WB-MRI, outperforming baseline and SSL methods with improved accuracy and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting metastatic bone disease in WB-MRI is challenging due to lesion variability, ambiguous boundaries, and class imbalance. Existing methods like SSL fail to capture nuanced features needed for accurate detection.

Method: SAP learns from limited anatomical labels: first, a skeletal segmentation model is trained on healthy WB-MRI scans, then applied to segment MBD in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Result: SAP achieves a normalized surface Dice of 0.76, Dice coefficient of 0.64, and lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, with 100% sensitivity for lesions >1ml in 28/32 patients.

Conclusion: Learning bone morphology from anatomy provides an effective inductive bias for bone lesion segmentation, with SAP outperforming baseline and SSL methods.

Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)
is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations
of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining
reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion
variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,
and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large
unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the
nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method
that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based
skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from
healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its
downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with
metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a
state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,
achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The
method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24
(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions
larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32
patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant
inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of
bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.

*Klara Leffler,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Samuel Kuttner,Karin Söderkvist,Jan Axelsson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep sinogram restoration network using a modified Residual U-Net is proposed to compensate for missing data in sparse PET scanner configurations, achieving better results than 2D interpolation but with some loss of sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of densely packed photodetectors in long axial field-of-view PET scanners limits clinical use. Sparse configurations reduce costs but degrade image quality.

Method: A modified Residual U-Net is trained on clinical PET scans to restore missing sinogram data, simulating 50% detector removal in a chessboard pattern.

Result: The model recovers missing counts with low error, outperforming 2D interpolation, though reconstructed images lose some sharpness.

Conclusion: Sparse PET configurations combined with deep learning offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional designs, advancing medical imaging technology.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and
sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost
is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the
extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost
limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,
allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a
standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we
propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram
data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET
scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in
a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model
successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two
events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and
reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a
smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer
details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial
capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector
configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector
configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable
alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the
development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant
step forward in medical imaging technology.

*Ahmad Mustafa,Reza Rastegar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture combining DeepLabV3 and ConvLSTM is proposed for prostate gland segmentation in T2-weighted MRI, outperforming 2D and 3D models in accuracy and robustness, especially in data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate gland segmentation is crucial for cancer assessment but challenging due to limitations of 2D CNNs (ignoring inter-slice continuity) and 3D models (requiring large annotated datasets).

Method: A hybrid model using DeepLabV3 for slice-wise feature extraction and ConvLSTM for inter-slice integration, tested on PROMISE12 under clean and degraded conditions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D models in precision, recall, IoU, and DSC, showing robustness in data-limited and noisy settings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a clinically viable solution for accurate and consistent prostate segmentation, even with limited or noisy data.

Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet
challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep
learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most
conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks
(CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their
accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but
require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical
settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that
models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained
DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice
and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate
information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination
enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in
data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the
PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings.
Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection
over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the local-global training mismatch in NeRF-based CBCT reconstruction by introducing a Normalized Hash Encoder and Mapping Consistency Initialization (MCI) strategy, improving stability, convergence, and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT reconstruction suffers from artifacts due to limited X-ray projections. NeRF-based methods face a local-global training mismatch between hash encoders and neural networks, leading to unstable training and degraded results.

Method: Proposes a Normalized Hash Encoder for feature consistency and a Mapping Consistency Initialization (MCI) strategy to stabilize early training by leveraging a well-trained model's global mapping property.

Result: The method improves training efficiency, stability, and reconstruction quality across 128 CT cases from 4 datasets, covering 7 anatomical regions.

Conclusion: The introduced techniques effectively mitigate the local-global mismatch, enhancing NeRF-based CBCT reconstruction with minimal code changes.

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

*Mubaraq Yakubu,Navodini Wijethilake,Jonathan Shapey,Andrew King,Alexander Hammers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A systematic review of 34 studies on automatic and semi-automatic MRI segmentation methods for pituitary gland and adenomas, highlighting the prevalence of deep learning (U-Net) and performance variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate MRI segmentation of pituitary gland and adenomas is crucial for diagnosis and treatment, necessitating evaluation of automated methods.

Method: Reviewed 34 studies on automatic/semi-automatic segmentation, focusing on techniques (e.g., U-Net) and performance metrics like Dice scores.

Result: Deep learning (U-Net) dominated; Dice scores varied widely (0.19--96.41%). Semi-automatic methods outperformed fully automatic ones.

Conclusion: U-Net shows promise, but gaps in reporting (e.g., MR field strength) and performance in small structures (normal gland) need addressing. Larger datasets and innovation are key.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of
pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation
methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of
pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that
employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and
synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as
Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep
learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent.
Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and
4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported
80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation.
Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field
strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as
U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but
further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in
small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and
larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore NCA's capabilities in precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using ARC-AGI as a challenging domain.

Method: Gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules for transforming input grids into outputs, tested on ARC tasks.

Result: NCA models perform efficiently on abstract grid-based tasks, with insights from design modifications and training constraints.

Conclusion: NCAs are a promising approach for self-organizing systems, with broader applications suggested by their behavior in ARC.

Abstract: Cellular automata and their differentiable counterparts, Neural Cellular
Automata (NCA), are highly expressive and capable of surprisingly complex
behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and
Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) as a domain that
challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing
systems.

### [305] [Enhancing Generalization of Spiking Neural Networks Through Temporal Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19256)
*Boxuan Zhang,Zhen Xu,Kuan Tao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A Temporal Regularization Training (TRT) method is proposed to mitigate overfitting in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by enforcing time-dependent constraints, improving generalization on neuromorphic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs face overfitting due to limited dataset scale and gradient mismatching, hindering generalization.

Method: Introduces TRT with a time-dependent regularization mechanism, focusing on early timesteps. Evaluated on CIFAR10/100, ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101.

Result: TRT reduces overfitting, flattens loss landscape, and enhances generalization. Fisher information analysis reveals Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) in early timesteps.

Conclusion: TRT effectively improves SNN generalization by leveraging temporal regularization and robust feature learning in early timesteps.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

*Jiahui Hu,Wenjun Dong*

Main category: physics.space-ph

TL;DR: CAM-NET is an AI model using SFNO for efficient and accurate prediction of atmospheric variables, achieving 1000x speedup over WACCM-X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is needed to understand gravity wave propagation and atmospheric coupling.

Method: Leverages SFNO for global dynamics, modular architecture for tracer prediction, and is trained on WACCM-X data.

Result: Matches WACCM-X accuracy with 1000x faster inference, predicts key atmospheric parameters, and generalizes well for tracers like O2.

Conclusion: CAM-NET offers a computationally efficient, accurate alternative for atmospheric modeling with modular adaptability.

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SOF improves 3D Gaussian-based scene reconstruction by introducing hierarchical resorting and robust Gaussian depth, enhancing mesh quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surface extraction from 3D Gaussians suffer from artifacts and limited fidelity due to approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics.

Method: SOF uses hierarchical resorting, robust Gaussian depth, a level-set regularizer, and geometrically-consistent primitive losses. It also employs a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm.

Result: SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces processing time by over three times.

Conclusion: SOF advances efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved
the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit
nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting
accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments -
remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth
estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and
limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted
Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D
Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work
by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian
depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we
incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and
introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In
addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to
our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude.
As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher
reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a
factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient
Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.

TL;DR: A method for rendering large 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory, reducing memory usage and accelerating rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes efficiently.

Method: Leverages virtual memory and virtual texturing to dynamically stream visible Gaussians to the GPU for real-time rendering, integrating level of detail for optimization.

Result: Reduced memory usage and faster rendering, especially for complex scenes, with practical evaluations on desktop and mobile devices.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances rendering efficiency for large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view
synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly
accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have
drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we
present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes
using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual
texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and
dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering.
Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results
in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for
highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be
integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for
large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key
practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its
impact on desktop and mobile devices.

*Matyas Bohacek,Thomas Fel,Maneesh Agrawala,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify and analyze 'conceptual blindspots' in generative image models, revealing specific suppressed and exaggerated concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often fail to produce images with simple concepts despite training on large datasets, raising questions about structural limitations.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings and compares concept prevalence between real and generated images.

Result: Identifies specific suppressed (e.g., bird feeders) and exaggerated (e.g., wood texture) blindspots in models like Stable Diffusion and PixArt.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework for systematically assessing conceptual fidelity in generative models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

TL;DR: The paper surveys HPC capabilities in U.S. universities, revealing slower growth compared to national and industrial systems, and suggests solutions like federated computing and cost-sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI and digital twin technologies has increased HPC demand, but university systems lag behind national and industrial infrastructures.

Method: The study benchmarks 50+ U.S. universities' HPC systems against DOE and industrial standards, analyzing compute capacity, design, governance, and efficiency.

Result: University HPC growth (18% CAGR) trails national (43%) and industrial (78%) systems, with GPU-dense AI workloads exacerbating the gap.

Conclusion: Federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and decentralized reinforcement learning are proposed to democratize HPC access for academic research.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of managing computational and storage demands in large-scale scientific collaborations by developing an interactive system using real-world data and generative AI to optimize data placement and payload allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale experiments generate massive data volumes, requiring efficient computation and storage management. Current heuristic-based approaches lack dynamic models for evaluating alternatives.

Method: The study uses job execution records from the PanDA system to identify performance indicators and develops a generative AI model to simulate payload time series, incorporating visible and hidden features.

Result: Key performance indicators like queuing time and error rate were identified. A generative AI model was created to simulate payloads, including hidden features influencing job allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed system aims to improve decision-making in data placement and payload allocation, addressing inefficiencies in current heuristic methods.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between cost-efficiency and specialization in multilingual programming tasks with LLMs.

Method: Introduces MoLE, a novel architecture with a base model, shared LoRA module, and language-specific LoRA modules, optimized jointly during finetuning.

Result: MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency and higher accuracy compared to single shared or separate language-specific models.

Conclusion: MoLE effectively balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual programming, offering a practical solution for LLM-based coding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces pedagogical prompting to improve students' learning with LLMs, validated through a study in CS education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about students' misuse of LLMs in education by teaching effective prompting for learning.

Method: Developed pedagogical prompting, surveyed instructors (N=36), designed an interactive system, and tested with students (N=22).

Result: Improved students' LLM-based help-seeking skills and positive attitudes toward pedagogical prompting.

Conclusion: Pedagogical prompting is effective and scalable for integrating learning-oriented LLM use in education.

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Conclusion: HARPT is released as a public resource to support interdisciplinary research in health informatics, cybersecurity, and NLP.

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store
reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset
comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a
baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support

*Leon Klein,Atharva Kelkar,Aleksander Durumeric,Yaoyi Chen,Frank Noé*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces flow-based kernels to improve machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) force fields, reducing local distortions while maintaining global accuracy, using only configurational samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional force matching in MLCG requires extensive labeled force data, which is often unavailable. Noise-based kernels address this but introduce local distortions.

Method: The authors propose normalizing flow-based kernels to refine MLCG force fields, eliminating the need for force labels and reducing distortions.

Result: Flow-based kernels successfully generate high-quality coarse-grained forces from configurational samples, tested on small proteins.

Conclusion: Flow-based kernels offer a robust solution for MLCG, improving accuracy without requiring force labels.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

### [316] [TTSDS2: Resources and Benchmark for Evaluating Human-Quality Text to Speech Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19441)
*Christoph Minixhofer,Ondrej Klejch,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTSDS2, an improved metric for evaluating TTS systems, validated across domains and languages, and releases resources for synthetic speech evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS evaluation metrics are either subjective (hard to compare) or objective (lack validation). Recent TTS systems produce speech indistinguishable from real speech, challenging existing metrics.

Method: The authors propose TTSDS2, an enhanced version of TTSDS, and validate it against subjective scores. They also provide datasets, a pipeline, and a benchmark for multilingual TTS evaluation.

Result: TTSDS2 outperforms 15 other metrics, achieving a Spearman correlation above 0.50 across all domains and subjective scores. Resources include 11,000+ subjective ratings and a multilingual benchmark.

Conclusion: TTSDS2 is a robust metric for TTS evaluation, validated by strong correlations with subjective scores. The released resources support ongoing evaluation of synthetic speech.

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

*Diego Di Carlo,Mathieu Fontaine,Aditya Arie Nugraha,Yoshiaki Bando,Kazuyoshi Yoshii*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel SSL technique combines an α-stable model with a Neural Steerer for robust DOA estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sound source localization by addressing non-Gaussian signals and residual reconstruction errors.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network (Neural Steerer) to interpolate steering vectors and leverages an α-stable model for robust DOA estimation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in scenarios with multiple sound sources.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively combines neural networks and α-stable models for superior SSL performance.

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

### [318] [IndieFake Dataset: A Benchmark Dataset for Audio Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19014)
*Abhay Kumar,Kunal Verma,Omkar More*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IndieFake Dataset (IFD) to address the lack of diverse ethnic accents in existing audio deepfake datasets, focusing on Indian English speakers. It outperforms benchmarks like ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the In-The-Wild (ITW) dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio deepfake datasets lack diversity, particularly in South-Asian accents, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This gap hinders the detection of deepfakes in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

Method: The authors created the IFD dataset, featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio from 50 Indian English speakers. It includes balanced data distribution and speaker-level characterization.

Result: IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and is more challenging than the ITW dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse contexts.

Conclusion: The IFD dataset fills a critical gap in audio deepfake detection by providing diverse ethnic representation, enhancing the robustness of detection models.

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

### [319] [Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis in Optimal Treatment Regimes and Causal Decomposition with Individualized Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19010)
*Soojin Park,Suyeon Kang,Chioun Lee*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends causal decomposition analysis by incorporating optimal treatment regimes (OTRs) for individualized effects, addressing omitted confounding through simulation-based sensitivity analysis and a formal bounding strategy for binary risk factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities, accounting for potential omitted confounding in individualized effects derived from OTRs.

Method: Extends simulation-based sensitivity analysis to simulate unmeasured confounders and proposes a formal bounding strategy for benchmarking omitted confounding strength in binary risk factors.

Result: Demonstrates the approach using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09).

Conclusion: The proposed methods address biases in OTRs and individualized effects, providing tools for sensitivity analysis and benchmarking omitted confounding.

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

### [320] [When Diffusion Models Memorize: Inductive Biases in Probability Flow of Minimum-Norm Shallow Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19031)
*Chen Zeno,Hila Manor,Greg Ongie,Nir Weinberger,Tomer Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence behavior of probability flow in diffusion models, showing it can memorize training samples or generate novel points on the data manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when probability flow in diffusion models converges to training samples or general manifold points, given incomplete theoretical understanding.

Method: Study probability flow of shallow ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal ℓ² norm, introducing a simpler score flow for intuition.

Result: Probability flow converges to training points, sums of points, or manifold points, with memorization decreasing as training samples increase.

Conclusion: Diffusion models balance memorization and novel generation, with early stopping enabling manifold exploration.

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

### [321] [Posterior Contraction for Sparse Neural Networks in Besov Spaces with Intrinsic Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19144)
*Kyeongwon Lee,Lizhen Lin,Jaewoo Park,Seonghyun Jeong*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal posterior contraction rates for anisotropic Besov spaces, mitigating dimensionality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional, structured estimation problems by leveraging sparse Bayesian neural networks.

Method: Use of sparse or continuous shrinkage priors in Bayesian neural networks to adapt to the intrinsic dimensionality of the true function.

Result: Optimal contraction rates are achieved, with adaptation to unknown smoothness levels, accommodating additive and multiplicative Besov functions.

Conclusion: The framework advances theoretical foundations and justifies the practical effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

### [322] [Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19276)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and its local entropy (LE) as sources of algorithmic hardness, resolving the paradox of efficient algorithms near capacity by identifying rare dense clusters. Using advanced duality theory, it shows LE breakdown aligns with computational gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the paradox of efficient algorithms existing near the capacity of ABP despite apparent algorithmic hardness, and to investigate the role of atypical clusters and LE in this context.

Method: Utilizes fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) and its large deviation upgrade (sfl LD RDT) to study atypical features like LE in ABP.

Result: LE breakdown occurs for constraint densities α in (0.77,0.78), matching the range where best ABP solvers operate, suggesting LE behavior reflects computational gaps.

Conclusion: The behavior of LE is a key indicator of ABP's computational gaps, resolving the paradox by linking atypical clusters and algorithmic efficiency.

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper compares SAX, eSAX, and TDA for clustering Google Trends data, finding TDA superior for handling volatility and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in clustering high-dimensional, noisy Google Trends data for real-time marketing and trend forecasting.

Method: Evaluated three unsupervised clustering methods (SAX, eSAX, TDA) on 20 Google Trends keywords.

Result: SAX and eSAX are fast and interpretable but struggle with volatility; TDA captures structural features better.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining symbolic and topological methods are recommended for future consumer analytics.

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

### [325] [Convergence of Mean Shift Algorithms for Large Bandwidths and Simultaneous Accurate Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19837)
*Susovan Pal,Praneeth Vepakomma*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper generalizes previous results on the convergence of the mean shift algorithm, proving convergence for sufficiently large bandwidth with any radially symmetric and strictly positive definite kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of mean shift algorithm convergence by relaxing kernel restrictions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Uses characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite kernels and borrows proof techniques from prior work to establish convergence under large bandwidth conditions.

Result: Convergence is guaranteed in any dimension for sufficiently large bandwidth with any radially symmetric and strictly positive definite kernels.

Conclusion: The work provides a broader theoretical foundation for mean shift convergence, though it remains more restrictive than some recent results due to bandwidth limitations.

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

*Siyang Song,Yupeng Huo,Shiqing Tang,Jiaee Cheong,Rui Gao,Michel Valstar,Hatice Gunes*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper reviews multi-modal human behaviors for automatic depression assessment (ADA), summarizing ML/DL approaches, datasets, and challenges to guide future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional depression diagnosis is subjective, slow, and costly. ADA using ML/DL can leverage behavioral cues for more objective and scalable solutions.

Method: Summarizes depression-related behaviors across modalities (brain, language, audio, facial, body) and reviews ML-based ADA approaches.

Result: Identifies distinctive features and limitations of ADA methods, reviews datasets, and highlights challenges like multi-modal integration.

Conclusion: Calls for further research to address ADA challenges, emphasizing opportunities in multi-modal learning and scalable solutions.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Motivation: To formalize neuroscientific observations of consciousness and explore its reductionist potential in machines.

Method: Develops a set-theoretic formalism using Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to prove machine consciousness.

Conclusion: Argues for the feasibility of a reductionist form of epistemic consciousness in artificial systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel paradigm of the local percept-perceiver
phenomenon to formalize certain observations in neuroscientific theories of
consciousness. Using this model, a set-theoretic formalism is developed for
artificial systems, and the existence of machine consciousness is proved by
invoking Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The article argues for the possibility of
a reductionist form of epistemic consciousness within machines.

TL;DR: The study compares the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in macaques and humans, revealing species-specific connectivity patterns that may explain human language evolution and disorders like aphasia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve controversies about AF organization in nonhuman primates and understand its divergence from human anatomy, particularly in language-related networks.

Method: Combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing (viral labeling and tomography in macaques) with 11.7T diffusion MRI tractography, supplemented by 7.0T MRI spectral embedding in humans for comparative connectomic analysis.

Result: Macaque AF originates in temporal-parietal cortex, while human AF shows expanded middle temporal gyrus connectivity and stronger frontoparietal links, quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis.

Conclusion: Interspecies AF differences suggest a connectivity-based substrate for human language evolution and provide a framework for understanding AF-related disorders.

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman
primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges
from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing -
using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning
tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain
tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding
analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis
of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the
temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum,
and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits
greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and
parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler
analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language
networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader
temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a
connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing
unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework
for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where
aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

TL;DR: IQFMs, a hybrid quantum-classical framework, improves quantum machine learning by iteratively connecting shallow QFMs with classical augmentation, reducing noise and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like circuit noise, hardware constraints, and computational bottlenecks in variational quantum algorithms hinder deep QFM deployment.

Method: Proposes IQFMs, combining shallow QFMs with classical augmentation weights, using contrastive learning and layer-wise training.

Result: Outperforms quantum convolutional neural networks in noisy quantum data tasks and matches classical neural networks in image classification.

Conclusion: IQFMs offer a viable solution to current quantum ML limitations, enhancing performance without variational parameter optimization.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

TL;DR: A novel framework combining CV quantum diffusion and CVQNNs for high-fidelity quantum state generation and restoration, achieving over 99% fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of generating and preserving complex quantum states against environmental noise in CV quantum information processing.

Method: Uses a thermal loss channel for forward diffusion and a CVQNN-based backward denoising process for state generation (CVQD-G) and restoration (CVQD-R).

Result: High-fidelity generation of Gaussian and non-Gaussian states (>99%) and robust restoration of corrupted states.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient, scalable, and promising for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation in CV systems.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

*Hevish Cowlessur,Tansu Alpcan,Chandra Thapa,Seyit Camtepe,Neel Kanth Kundu*

TL;DR: qPGA is a non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction in quantum systems, reducing qubit needs and enhancing resistance to attacks while preserving data structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like quantum autoencoders face hardware constraints and security vulnerabilities, necessitating a more efficient and secure approach.

Method: qPGA uses Riemannian geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, enabling qubit-efficient amplitude encoding.

Result: Empirical tests show qPGA outperforms quantum autoencoders in preserving data structure and security, achieving high accuracy in QML tasks.

Conclusion: qPGA offers a scalable, noise-resilient solution for practical QML, with strong performance on real hardware and simulators.

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: COM-QEL combines quantum extremal learning with conservative objective models to improve offline model-based optimization, outperforming QEL by ensuring cautious predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of overly optimistic predictions in unexplored regions by integrating conservative modeling with quantum learning.

Method: Propose COM-QEL, a hybrid algorithm combining quantum neural networks (QEL) with conservative objective models (COM) for regularization.

Result: COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with higher true objective values than QEL on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: COM-QEL is superior for offline design problems, balancing expressive power with cautious generalization.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

*Zhenke Liu,Jien Li,Ziqi Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: eccDNAMamba is a bidirectional state-space encoder for circular DNA sequences, offering efficient full-context representation learning and scalability up to 200 Kbp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing genomic models lack support for full-length circular eccDNA, limiting analysis due to inefficiency or resolution constraints.

Method: eccDNAMamba combines forward and reverse passes with linear-time complexity and a novel augmentation strategy to preserve circular structure.

Result: Tested on real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification performance and handles sequences up to 200 Kbp.

Conclusion: eccDNAMamba provides a robust and efficient framework for modeling circular genomes, addressing current limitations in genomic analysis.

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream
analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide
resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

### [334] [MATE: LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Translation Environment for Accessibility Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19502)
*Aleksandr Algazinov,Matt Laing,Paul Laban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MATE is a multimodal accessibility multi-agent system (MAS) that converts data into user-preferred formats, aiding individuals with disabilities. It supports various models and ensures privacy by running locally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS lack customization for accessibility, creating barriers for users with disabilities. MATE aims to provide adaptable, comprehensive assistance.

Method: MATE uses modality conversions based on user needs, supported by diverse models (LLM APIs, custom ML classifiers). It includes ModCon-Task-Identifier for precise task extraction.

Result: MATE outperforms other models in modality conversion tasks and is adaptable across domains like healthcare.

Conclusion: MATE offers a flexible, privacy-focused solution for accessibility, with potential for broad application and integration with institutional technologies.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

### [335] [Stabilizing PDE--ML Coupled System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19274)
*Saad Qadeer,Panos Stinis,Hui Wan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses instabilities in machine-learnt surrogates for PDE systems, focusing on a viscous Burgers'-ML system, and proposes stabilization strategies and accuracy improvements using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming instabilities in machine-learnt surrogates for larger PDE systems, which current accuracy and structure-based approaches have limited success in resolving.

Method: Study a prototype problem (viscous Burgers'-ML system), identify instability causes, prescribe stabilization strategies, and explore Mori-Zwanzig formalism for accuracy.

Result: Insights and strategies for stabilizing coupled systems and improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides a pathway to stabilize and enhance the accuracy of machine-learnt surrogates in PDE systems.

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger
PDE systems is the onset of instabilities when solved numerically. Efforts
towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy
of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered
limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw
insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a
viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the
instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve
the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the
Mori--Zwanzig formalism.

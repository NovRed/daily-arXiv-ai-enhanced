Despite growing interest in data curation for\ntraining clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,\nunder-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,\ncomparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental\nhealth care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of\nclinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of\nAI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground). Along with these, we also investigate synthetic clinical mental\nhealth datasets. Our survey identifies critical gaps such as a lack of\nlongitudinal data, limited cultural and linguistic representation, inconsistent\ncollection and annotation standards, and a lack of modalities in synthetic\ndata. We conclude by outlining key challenges in curating and standardizing\nfuture datasets and provide actionable recommendations to facilitate the\ndevelopment of more robust, generalizable, and equitable mental health AI\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper surveys clinical mental health datasets for AI development, highlighting gaps like lack of longitudinal data and cultural diversity, and provides recommendations for better datasets.", "motivation": "The rise in mental health disorders and shortage of clinicians necessitates AI assistance, but current datasets are scattered and inadequate, hindering AI model development.", "method": "The authors conduct a comprehensive survey of clinical mental health datasets, categorizing them by disorder, modality, task, accessibility, and sociocultural context, and analyze synthetic datasets.", "result": "Identified gaps include limited longitudinal data, cultural/linguistic diversity, inconsistent standards, and synthetic data shortcomings.", "conclusion": "The paper outlines challenges and actionable recommendations to improve dataset quality for more robust and equitable mental health AI systems."}}

The current artificial sensors developed for\nodor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings\nlack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor\ndetection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two\nhypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are\nsufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from\nthe olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an\nensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and\nAttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory\nbulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble\nmodel supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score\nof 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous\nbenchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework\ncaptures biologically significant signatures.

CADE integrates actor, cost estimator, and SDM for safe RL.", "result": "MGAE outperforms traditional methods in convergence and performance. SDM improves short-term predictions, and CADE ensures safety during training and inference.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework effectively balances reward and safety, enhancing autonomous river following for UAVs."}}

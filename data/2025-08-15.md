### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF improves few-shot learning for food images by filtering patch embeddings to focus on class-relevant features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images' visual complexity and variability cause misclassification in few-shot learning, requiring better focus on key elements.

Method: SPFF stochastically filters patch embeddings, discarding less similar ones, and uses a similarity matrix for classification.

Result: SPFF outperforms existing methods on Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPFF effectively addresses food image challenges in few-shot learning by focusing on relevant patches and filtering noise.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 introduces a scalable self-supervised vision model with Gram anchoring and post-hoc strategies, outperforming specialized models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate manual data annotation and enable scalable learning from diverse visual sources.

Method: Uses scaling of datasets/models, Gram anchoring for feature stability, and post-hoc enhancements for flexibility.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models across tasks without fine-tuning, delivering high-quality dense features.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning, offering versatile, scalable solutions for diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

### [3] [Empowering Morphing Attack Detection using Interpretable Image-Text Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10110)
*Sushrut Patwardhan,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Sushma Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal learning approach using CLIP for morphing attack detection, providing textual descriptions and evaluating zero-shot performance with various prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance face recognition systems by detecting morphing attacks and providing human-understandable textual descriptions.

Method: Uses Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for zero-shot evaluation, testing ten textual prompts on a face morphing dataset.

Result: Demonstrates generalizable morphing attack detection and predicts relevant text snippets, evaluated on five morphing techniques across three mediums.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects morphing attacks and provides interpretable textual descriptions, improving face recognition reliability.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using Large Vision-Language Models, combining radical and pictographic analysis for better generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for OBS decipherment lack interpretability and struggle with zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS due to ignored connections between glyphs and semantics.

Method: The method uses a progressive training strategy for radical and pictographic analysis, along with a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism, and introduces a new dataset (Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset).

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment, with logical analysis processes aiding archaeological research.

Conclusion: The method advances OBS decipherment, offering interpretability and potential applications in digital humanities and historical research.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method for automatic fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans is developed and validated, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM) in health research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve the accuracy of fiducial point placement on TBDXA scans for body composition assessment.

Method: A deep learning approach is trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and validated on an external dataset.

Result: The method achieves 99.5% accuracy in keypoint placement and successfully associates SAM features with health markers in two cohorts.

Conclusion: The method is effective for TBDXA analysis, supports health research, and is made publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MANGO, a Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow method, to improve interpretability and performance in multimodal fusion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion methods using Transformers lack explicit feature capture and struggle with complex correlations.

Method: Proposes an Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer and three cross-attention mechanisms (MMCA, IMCA, LICA) for Normalizing Flow-based multimodal learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification.

Conclusion: MANGO provides an interpretable, scalable solution for multimodal fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining real and synthetic images improves crop disease classification accuracy, outperforming models trained on either alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating real and synthetic images for enhancing disease classification in agriculture, addressing the gap in research on hybrid datasets.

Method: Used five dataset treatments (H0-H4) with varying real-to-synthetic ratios, trained on a custom EfficientNetV2-L model with fine-tuning and transfer learning.

Result: Models with hybrid datasets (H2-H4) achieved high precision, recall, and F1-scores, with H3-H4 reaching a weighted F1-score of 1.00.

Conclusion: Hybrid datasets combining real and synthetic images maximize model performance, proving synthetic images alone are insufficient.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic data framework to improve vision-language models (VLMs) and object detectors for rare, safety-critical tasks like industrial spill detection, where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance of VLMs degrades in niche, safety-critical domains due to rare, sensitive, and hard-to-annotate real data. Privacy and infrequency of incidents make conventional fine-tuning impractical.

Method: A scalable synthetic data generation pipeline is proposed to enable Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of VLMs and boost detectors like YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data (SynSpill) significantly improves VLMs and detectors, making their performance comparable. VLMs generalize better without synthetic data.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data bridges domain gaps in safety-critical applications, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution for vision systems in data-scarce industrial settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) requires compression for storage/transmission. EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method, reduces data rates by 30x while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The separation of Gaussian creation and view rendering in 3DGS necessitates efficient compression of Gaussian attributes for storage and transmission.

Method: Analyzed Gaussian attribute correlations, revealing Laplace and Gaussian distributions. Proposed EntropyGS, a factorized entropy coding method with adaptive quantization.

Result: Achieved 30x rate reduction on benchmarks with similar rendering quality and fast encoding/decoding.

Conclusion: EntropyGS effectively compresses 3DGS data without compromising visual quality, enabling efficient storage and transmission.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

*Paul H. Acosta,Pingjun Chen,Simon P. Castillo,Maria Esther Salvatierra,Yinyin Yuan,Xiaoxi Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellSymphony integrates Xenium spatial transcriptomics and histology images using foundation models to improve cell type annotation and microenvironment analysis in tumors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting robust cell-level features from histology images and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data is a challenge.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-derived embeddings to fuse spatial gene expression with morphological context.

Result: Accurate cell type annotation and identification of distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Foundation models and multimodal fusion are powerful for understanding cell orchestration in complex tissues.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews trends in deep learning-based crack detection, highlighting shifts in learning paradigms, generalizability, and dataset diversity. It introduces a new 3D dataset (3DCrack) and benchmarks deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze emerging trends in crack detection using deep learning and address gaps in dataset diversity and evaluation.

Method: Systematic review of trends and benchmarking experiments with a new 3D dataset (3DCrack) and foundation models.

Result: Identified key shifts in learning paradigms and generalizability, provided baselines for deep learning methods, and introduced a new dataset.

Conclusion: The paper offers insights into evolving methodologies and future directions for deep learning in crack detection, supported by a new dataset and benchmarks.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

### [12] [MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD is a training-free method to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by fusing predictions from multiple image regions using consistency-aware weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinations due to limited ability to verify visual information, leading to inconsistent text outputs.

Method: MRFD uses cross-attention to identify salient regions, generates responses for each, and fuses them with JSD-based reliability weights.

Result: MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factuality in LVLM responses without model updates.

Conclusion: MRFD effectively enhances factual grounding in LVLMs by leveraging inter-region consistency, offering a practical solution to hallucination issues.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [13] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation across individuals by proposing a dynamic calibration strategy that improves robustness to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PoG estimators require person-specific calibration but struggle with head pose variations, limiting their accuracy and usability.

Method: The authors create a benchmark (MobilePoG) with diverse head poses and analyze calibration strategies. They propose dynamic calibration, where users move their phones during calibration to introduce pose variation.

Result: Experiments show that calibration with varied head poses improves estimator robustness. The dynamic strategy outperforms conventional methods in handling pose variations.

Conclusion: The dynamic calibration strategy enhances PoG estimation accuracy by making it less sensitive to head pose changes, offering a user-friendly solution.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [14] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method improves text-driven image generation by combining contrastive learning and structural guidance, enhancing semantic alignment and structural fidelity without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in semantic alignment and structural consistency in existing text-driven image generation methods.

Method: Integrates text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance, using contrastive learning and structural priors like layout maps or sketches. Jointly optimizes contrastive, structural, and semantic losses.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks on COCO-2014 in CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, improving semantic and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges semantic alignment and structural fidelity, offering a viable path for text-image modeling and generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

### [15] [VIFSS: View-Invariant and Figure Skating-Specific Pose Representation Learning for Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10281)
*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) framework for figure skating jumps, addressing data insufficiency and 3D procedural challenges with a view-invariant pose representation and fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recognition of figure skating jumps is crucial for performance evaluation but requires expert knowledge. Existing TAS methods lack sufficient annotated data and ignore 3D aspects and procedural structure.

Method: Introduces VIFSS for view-invariant pose representation using contrastive learning and fine-tuning. Creates FS-Jump3D dataset and a fine-grained annotation scheme for jump phases.

Result: Achieves over 92% F1@50 on element-level TAS, demonstrating effectiveness, especially with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses TAS limitations for figure skating, offering practical solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

*Simindokht Jahangard,Mehrzad Mohammadi,Yi Shen,Zhixi Cai,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks by formalizing reasoning complexity and providing customizable questions with detailed annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning benchmarks lack clear complexity definitions, customization, and structured annotations, limiting their utility for evaluating embodied AI agents.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity, develop an adaptive query engine for customizable questions, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric annotations.

Result: JRDB-Reasoning is created, enabling fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of VLMs across reasoning levels.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and engine address gaps in visual reasoning evaluation, offering a structured and adaptable tool for assessing AI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCWLAD, a method for high-accuracy multimodal optical image matching, combining coarse (SSIM) and fine (WLAD) steps, outperforming existing methods with ~0.4 pixel accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing degraded matching accuracy due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation in multimodal images.

Method: Coarse matching with SSIM, fine matching with WLAD, using phase consistency and mutual structure filtering.

Result: PCWLAD achieved ~0.4 pixel accuracy, outperforming eight state-of-the-art methods in CMR and RMSE.

Conclusion: PCWLAD is effective for multimodal image matching, with publicly available software and datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterSyn introduces a framework for realistic motion synthesis by jointly learning solo and multi-person dynamics, outperforming prior methods in alignment and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that treat solo and interactive motions separately, InterSyn aims to capture natural interactions and coordination in real-world scenarios.

Method: InterSyn uses two modules: INS for joint modeling of solo and interactive behaviors, and REC for refining mutual dynamics and synchronization.

Result: InterSyn generates motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: InterSyn advances motion synthesis by integrating solo and interactive dynamics, with plans to open-source the code for further research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for precise OoD object localization in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: Categorizes OoD segmentation approaches into four groups: test-time OoD segmentation, outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models.

Result: Systematic review of advances in OoD segmentation, identifying challenges and future research directions.

Conclusion: OoD segmentation is vital for autonomous driving, and further research is needed to address emerging challenges.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

TL;DR: A survey on RL-based methods for visual content generation, highlighting their role in improving controllability, consistency, and human alignment compared to traditional surrogate objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism due to surrogate objectives like likelihood or reconstruction loss. RL provides a principled framework for optimizing these non-differentiable, preference-driven goals.

Method: The paper reviews RL's evolution from classical control to its use in optimizing generative tasks, focusing on its integration into image, video, and 3D/4D generation as both a fine-tuning mechanism and structural component.

Result: RL enhances controllability, consistency, and human alignment in generative tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across various domains.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges and future research directions for combining RL and generative modeling to further improve visual content generation.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted training data selection method for vision-language instruction tuning, improving performance by focusing on matching concepts or skills to benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, where performance depends on training with similar skills or concepts, and optimize benchmark-specific performance.

Method: Extract concepts/skills from benchmarks, determine their primary benefit (concepts or skills), and select matching instructions for training.

Result: The method improves performance by +0.9% on average and +1.5% on skill-focused benchmarks over baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-off in instruction selection between conceptual knowledge and visual skills, emphasizing the need for balanced optimization.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a deep learning framework for automated analysis of glomerular ultrastructure in kidney diseases, addressing limitations of current methods by quantifying multiple key features simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology methods focus on individual ultrastructure recognition, which falls short of practical diagnostic needs. The study aims to automate and enhance the analysis of multiple ultrastructural features for better kidney disease diagnosis.

Method: The Glo-DMU framework uses three deep models: ultrastructure segmentation, glomerular filtration barrier region classification, and electron-dense deposits detection, to quantify key ultrastructural features like basement membrane thickness, foot process effacement, and deposit location.

Result: Evaluated on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed good consistency with manual pathological reports, demonstrating high precision and automation.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU is a fully automated, high-precision tool that simultaneously quantifies multiple ultrastructural features, aiding renal pathologists in diagnosis.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

semantic segmentation with a Bidirectional LSTM, incorporating confidence-based
pseudolabeling to refine our model. Finally, for modern English handwriting

*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework for disentangling spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM data, enabling interpretable atomic-resolution dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to entangled degradation effects like spatial drift and radiation damage. Existing methods struggle to separate these effects.

Method: AtomDiffuser predicts affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames, leveraging degradation as a temporally conditioned process.

Result: The framework generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data, supporting high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment.

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser provides interpretable tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns linked to atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of vision-language models (VLMs) by prompting them to judge pattern visibility, revealing gaps between model and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how VLMs align with human perception of low-level visual features, specifically the CSF, which is crucial for understanding their visual sensitivity.

Method: A behavioral psychophysics-inspired approach using band-pass filtered noise images and diverse prompts to estimate CSF in VLMs.

Result: Some models approximate human-like CSF but none fully replicate it; prompt phrasing significantly affects responses.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating VLMs' visual sensitivity and highlights discrepancies with human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps), addressing spatial inconsistencies and distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent images due to limited structural information. Leveraging intrinsic scene properties can enhance spatial consistency and realism.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic properties from a dataset, aggregates them into a latent variable, and simultaneously denoises image and intrinsic domains using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) while sharing mutual information.

Result: The method corrects spatial inconsistencies, produces more natural scene layouts, and maintains image fidelity and textual alignment (e.g., with Stable Diffusion).

Conclusion: Co-generating images and intrinsics improves spatial consistency and realism in image synthesis without degrading quality.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSegment+ is a novel augmentation framework for semantic segmentation that decouples image and label transformations to address subtle label noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain subtle label imperfections (e.g., ambiguous boundaries, annotator variability) that impair model performance, but existing methods risk amplifying these issues.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations to segmentation labels while keeping images unchanged, encouraging robust learning of object structures.

Result: NSegment+ achieves significant mIoU gains on datasets like Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, with improvements up to +3.39.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses implicit label noise and can be combined with other training tricks for further gains, highlighting its practical importance.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

TL;DR: Proposes PQ-DAF, a pose-driven data augmentation framework, to enhance few-shot driver distraction detection by leveraging vision-language models for sample filtering and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses degraded generalization in driver distraction detection due to few-shot learning challenges and domain shifts.

Method: Uses Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models (PCDMs) for pose feature synthesis and CogVLM for quality-controlled sample filtering.

Result: PQ-DAF improves model generalization in few-shot scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF effectively tackles data scarcity and domain shift, enhancing real-world deployment robustness.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method to suppress unwanted entangled content in text-to-image diffusion models by modifying text embeddings with a delta vector, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of suppressing strongly entangled content (e.g., 'mustache' with 'Charlie Chaplin') in T2I diffusion models despite explicit instructions.

Method: Introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings, obtained via zero-shot, and adapts it into cross-attention (SSDV) for precise suppression. Also optimizes delta vectors for personalized models.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively suppresses undesired content in T2I models, advancing their controllability and precision.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods on the OpenLane benchmark.

Conclusion: SC-Lane sets a rigorous standard for 3D lane detection, demonstrating significant improvements in height estimation and lane detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

*Shanyuan Liu,Jian Zhu,Junda Lu,Yue Gong,Liuzhuozheng Li,Bo Cheng,Yuhang Ma,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoControl introduces a lightweight, efficient method for controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs, reducing parameter and computational costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-image generation with DiTs rely on ControlNet, which adds significant overhead. NanoControl aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: NanoControl uses a LoRA-style control module and KV-Context Augmentation to integrate control signals directly into the DiT backbone, avoiding duplication and enabling deep feature fusion.

Result: NanoControl achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter (0.024%) and computational (0.029% GFLOPs) overhead, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: NanoControl offers a highly efficient solution for controllable text-to-image generation, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA is a large-scale VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving, addressing the limitations of VLMs trained on static data. It improves performance in spatial localization and temporal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited by training on static image-text pairs, hindering their ability to reason dynamically in traffic scenes. STRIDE-QA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The dataset is constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, featuring 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames with dense annotations like 3D bounding boxes and segmentation masks.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs on STRIDE-QA achieve 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, outperforming general-purpose VLMs.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRISP introduces Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting to address continual video instance segmentation challenges, improving instance, category, and task-wise learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise confusion in continual video instance segmentation while maintaining temporal consistency.

Method: Uses instance correlation loss, adaptive residual semantic prompts, and contrastive learning for semantic coherence. Introduces an initialization strategy for incremental prompts.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on YouTube-VIS datasets, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and enhancing segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively addresses continual video instance segmentation challenges with innovative techniques, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DOD-SA, a decoupled object detection framework using single-modality annotations, leveraging teacher-student collaboration and progressive training to reduce annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared-visible object detection methods require costly dual-modality annotations. DOD-SA aims to reduce this cost while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses CoSD-TSNet with SM-Branch and DMD-Branch, pseudo-labeling, and a three-stage PaST training strategy with PLA for label alignment.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Conclusion: DOD-SA effectively reduces annotation costs and improves detection performance through collaborative learning and progressive training.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dataset (DELP) and toolkit (SkeySpot) for automated symbol spotting in electrical floor plans, achieving 82.5% mAP with YOLOv8, aiding SMEs in digitization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy floor plans lack machine-readability, making large-scale interpretation slow and error-prone. Automated symbol spotting can streamline workflows like cost estimation and compliance.

Method: Introduces the DELP dataset (45 plans, 2,450 instances, 34 classes) and benchmarks pretrained object detection models, with YOLOv8 performing best. Develops SkeySpot for real-time symbol detection.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves 82.5% mAP. SkeySpot enables structured, standardized outputs for interoperable workflows, reducing reliance on proprietary CAD systems.

Conclusion: This approach enhances digitization accessibility for SMEs, supporting standardization, interoperability, and sustainability in construction.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired model, aligns with human perception in image tasks without supervised training, suggesting visual systems may optimize for moderate distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if human visual perception emerges from image statistics and if bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Method: End-to-end optimization of PerceptNet for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: The V1-like encoder correlates highly with human perceptual judgments, especially for moderate noise, blur, and sparsity.

Conclusion: Visual systems may be tuned to handle moderate distortions, and bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics autonomously.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Mamba, an online VSR method using Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods lack long-range temporal modeling, limiting performance. SSMs offer linear complexity and global receptive fields, motivating their use for improved efficiency and accuracy.

Method: TS-Mamba employs Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs (TSMA) for token selection and aggregation, using Hilbert scannings and shift operations to enhance spatial continuity. A trajectory-aware loss supervises token selection.

Result: TS-Mamba outperforms six benchmarks on three VSR datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 22.7% reduction in computational complexity (MACs).

Conclusion: TS-Mamba effectively combines long-term trajectory modeling with low-complexity Mamba for superior online VSR performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Motivation: Addressing the domain shift challenge in training models on single-species images and testing on multi-species quadrat images.

Method: Uses a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer with multi-head classification, multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies.

Result: Achieved 3rd best performance on the private leaderboard using 1.4 million training images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles the domain shift and multi-label prediction challenge, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through

inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.

*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining domain randomization and self-training with autoencoder-based quality control enables effective skull-stripping segmentation using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling for volumetric images like brain MRI is labor-intensive. Domain randomization and self-training can reduce dependency on labeled data but face limitations with very few label maps.

Method: 1) Synthesize images from voxel intensity bins to train an initial model. 2) Use a convolutional autoencoder to assess pseudo-label quality. 3) Fine-tune the network with top-ranking pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves skull-stripping performance close to models trained with more labeled data. Autoencoder-based ranking correlates better with segmentation accuracy than consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: The combination of domain randomization and autoencoder-based quality control offers a promising solution for semi-supervised segmentation with minimal labeled data, reducing labeling burdens.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of data processing methods for mmWave radar-based HAR, which is privacy-preserving but challenged by sparse, noisy data.

Method: Performance analysis of DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering individually, in pairs, and combined, using the MiliPoint dataset, with proposed enhancements.

Result: Provides insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their combinations, balancing recognition accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The study guides future mmWave-based HAR systems by highlighting effective method integrations and suggesting accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

TL;DR: A deep learning model (STAMP) is proposed for diagnosing Spread through Air Spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS diagnosis is labor-intensive and prone to errors, creating a need for automated, accurate deep learning solutions.

Method: A multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework (STAMP) with dual-branch architecture and transformer-based encoding is developed.

Result: STAMP achieved AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928 on three datasets, outperforming clinical standards.

Conclusion: STAMP offers a robust, automated solution for STAS diagnosis, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a tuning- and inversion-free framework for efficient and consistent image editing, outperforming existing methods in semantic preservation and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-align with target prompts and inadequately preserve source image semantics, relying on inefficient inversion anchors.

Method: TweezeEdit regularizes the entire denoising path, using gradient-driven regularization and a consistency model to inject target prompt semantics directly.

Result: TweezeEdit achieves superior semantic preservation and target alignment, requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit is highly efficient and effective, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new optimization framework for 3D Gaussian splatting integrates MSAA and dual geometric constraints to improve detail preservation in high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insufficient geometric constraints in 3D Gaussian splatting lead to blurred reconstructions of fine details, especially in high-frequency regions.

Method: The framework combines multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with adaptive blending of quadruple subsamples and introduces two geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed regions and gradient differential constraints for boundaries.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in preserving high-frequency details and sharp discontinuities, with significant improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances detail preservation in 3D Gaussian splatting while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Result: SBDE-generated images outperform state-of-the-art models and enhance defect detection.

Conclusion: SBDE is effective and has potential for practical applications in bolt defect detection.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

### [45] [EgoMusic-driven Human Dance Motion Estimation with Skeleton Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10522)
*Quang Nguyen,Nhat Le,Baoru Huang,Minh Nhat Vu,Chengcheng Tang,Van Nguyen,Ngan Le,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to predict human dance motion using both egocentric video and music, addressing challenges like body occlusion and music alignment. It proposes a new dataset (EgoAIST++) and a Skeleton Mamba-based model, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of jointly estimating human dance motion from egocentric video and music is underexplored, despite its industrial applications. Challenges include body occlusion in egocentric views and ensuring motion aligns with music.

Method: The paper introduces EgoAIST++, a large dataset combining egocentric views and music. It develops an EgoMusic Motion Network with a Skeleton Mamba to model human skeleton structure, leveraging diffusion models and Mamba for sequence modeling.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes well to real-world data, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenges of joint motion estimation from egocentric video and music, offering a robust solution with practical applications.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey unifies and analyzes five types of visual reasoning (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, commonsense), their methodologies, evaluation protocols, and challenges, proposing a future research agenda for AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys lack a unified analysis of visual reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluations, creating a gap this paper aims to fill.

Method: Categorizes visual reasoning into five types, examines implementation architectures (graph-based models, memory networks, etc.), and reviews evaluation protocols.

Result: Identifies limitations in generalizability, reproducibility, and explanatory power, and highlights open challenges like scalability and weak supervision.

Conclusion: Proposes a research agenda for next-gen vision systems, stressing the need to bridge perception and reasoning for transparent, trustworthy AI in critical domains.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale dataset for medical image grounding, and proposes Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework that outperforms existing methods and enhances downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image grounding research lacks modality diversity, fine-grained annotations, and a unified framework, limiting its applicability in intelligent diagnosis and related tasks.

Method: The authors construct Med-GLIP-5M, a dataset with 5.3M region-level annotations across seven modalities, and develop Med-GLIP, a framework that learns hierarchical semantics implicitly from the data.

Result: Med-GLIP surpasses state-of-the-art methods in grounding benchmarks and improves performance in downstream tasks like VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address key limitations in medical image grounding, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for intelligent medical applications.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GCRPNet, a novel network for SOD in ORSIs, combining graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception to address scale variations and low contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SOD for ORSIs include scale variations and low contrast; existing ViT and CNN methods struggle with integrating global and local features.

Method: Uses VSS encoder for multi-scale features, DS-HGAM for cross-layer interaction, and LEVSS block with adaptive scanning and MCAEM for local modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating effectiveness in distinguishing foreground and background.

Conclusion: GCRPNet effectively integrates long-range dependencies and regional features, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen is a novel model for multiple retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets, addressing domain shifts and label absence via dual-stream learning, feature distillation, and pseudo-label consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on fully annotated datasets and address challenges like domain shifts and missing labels in partially labeled datasets for retinal disease screening.

Method: PSScreen uses two streams: one for deterministic features and another for probabilistic features with uncertainty injection. It employs feature distillation for domain generalization and pseudo-label consistency for missing labels.

Result: PSScreen significantly improves detection performance for six retinal diseases and normal cases, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively addresses domain shifts and label absence, enhancing retinal disease screening performance.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel AR surgical navigation system for precise catheter placement, addressing depth perception and occlusion issues, and demonstrates improved accuracy with real-time tool-tracking guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional surgical navigation systems, particularly AR depth perception and occlusion challenges, in high-precision surgical settings.

Method: A novel surface tracing method registers target positions, and real-time infrared tool tracking aids catheter placement using Microsoft HoloLens 2. Two AR guidance conditions (static and real-time) were tested on phantom models.

Result: Real-time tool-tracking guidance improved accuracy metrics (insertion, target deviation, angular error, depth precision) and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The AR system with real-time tool tracking enhances surgical precision and usability, offering a promising solution for intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAP is a novel OOD detection method that enhances semantic supervision by retrieving external knowledge to augment prompts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack sufficient semantic supervision due to limited or mismatched outlier samples.

Method: RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers using external knowledge and dynamically updates prompts during testing.

Result: RAP reduces FPR95 by 7.05% and improves AUROC by 1.71% on ImageNet-1k compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: RAP's dynamic prompt augmentation with external knowledge significantly improves OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTQAT is a hybrid quantization method combining PTQ and QAT, fine-tuning critical layers for efficiency and accuracy, outperforming QAT-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between PTQ's performance degradation and QAT's high resource demands for efficient 3D perception network deployment.

Method: Selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning, applies PTQ to others, focusing on layers with smaller output discrepancies for better accuracy.

Result: Achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS, 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, and 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in segmentation and occupancy prediction.

Conclusion: PTQAT is efficient, universal, and outperforms QAT-only methods with fewer fine-tuned weights.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker improves talking head video generation by combining implicit and explicit motion cues, addressing issues like motion blur and lip jitter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack explicit articulatory priors, leading to motion blur and lip jitter in videos.

Method: HM-Talker uses a hybrid motion representation with implicit/explicit cues, a Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM), and a Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM).

Result: HM-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework advances personalized talking head synthesis by robustly synchronizing lip movements across diverse identities.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Motivation: Vision-based autonomous driving systems struggle in adverse weather, occlusions, and velocity estimation, which are critical for safety. SpaRC-AD aims to overcome these challenges by fusing camera and radar data.

Method: The framework uses sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation to refine agent anchors, map polylines, and motion modeling.

Result: SpaRC-AD outperforms vision-only baselines in 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and planning (-0.1m L2, -9% TPC).

Conclusion: Radar-camera fusion enhances spatial coherence and temporal consistency, proving effective in safety-critical scenarios for collision avoidance.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts SAM for RSCD, demonstrating superior performance in change detection tasks.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-Modal Agent, a flexible and adaptive system for Referring-based Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), leveraging LLMs and specialized tools to outperform traditional fixed-pipeline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RVOS methods are computationally complex and lack flexibility. Vision-language foundation models offer a training-free alternative, but existing approaches use rigid pipelines.

Method: The Multi-Modal Agent uses LLMs to generate dynamic workflows, iteratively interacting with specialized tools for low-level tasks across modalities to identify target objects.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches on RVOS and Ref-AVS tasks.

Conclusion: The agentic system provides a more adaptable and effective solution for multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: HumanSense is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' human-centered interaction capabilities, revealing gaps in advanced tasks and proposing improvements through multimodal inputs and reasoning-enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios in MLLMs hinders progress toward human-like interactions.

Method: Introduces HumanSense benchmark, uses multimodal inputs (visual, audio, text), and employs modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning.

Result: Leading MLLMs show room for improvement; omni-modal models and reasoning-enhanced approaches yield better performance.

Conclusion: Contextual analysis and reasoning are key for empathetic responses; HumanSense provides a framework for advancing MLLMs in human-centered tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality, complicating computer vision tasks; existing methods struggle due to the complexity of distortions.

Method: EvTurb uses a two-step event-guided network: event integrals reduce blur, and a variance map from event streams eliminates tilt distortion.

Result: EvTurb outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EvTurb effectively addresses turbulence distortions, supported by the TurbEvent dataset, and advances the field.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

### [59] [Towards Powerful and Practical Patch Attacks for 2D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10600)
*Yuxin Cao,Yedi Zhang,Wentao He,Yifan Liao,Yan Xiao,Chang Li,Zhiyong Huang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P$^3$A is a novel adversarial patch attack framework for autonomous driving, improving attack effectiveness and transferability on high-resolution datasets with new metrics and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks on autonomous driving systems overestimate effectiveness due to lenient metrics and fail on high-resolution data, posing safety risks.

Method: Introduces Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL), and Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) for better attack performance.

Result: P$^3$A outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and high-resolution datasets under practical and mAP-based metrics.

Conclusion: P$^3$A addresses gaps in adversarial patch attacks for autonomous driving, offering a more accurate and practical solution.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA) is a lightweight upsampling module for super-resolution, improving high-frequency detail reconstruction and reducing aliasing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsamplers often fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce aliasing artifacts, motivating the need for a better solution.

Method: FGA integrates a Fourier feature-based MLP, cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer, and frequency-domain L1 loss for improved performance.

Result: FGA enhances performance across five super-resolution backbones, with average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and up to 29% better frequency-domain consistency.

Conclusion: FGA is a practical, scalable alternative to traditional upsampling methods, effectively reducing aliasing and preserving fine details.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: FIND-Net, a novel MAR framework, integrates frequency and spatial domain processing to reduce metal artifacts in CT scans while preserving structural details, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metal artifacts in CT imaging degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing deep learning methods struggle to balance artifact suppression and structural preservation.

Method: FIND-Net combines Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and trainable Gaussian filtering, operating in both spatial and frequency domains for enhanced artifact reduction and detail retention.

Result: FIND-Net shows significant improvements: 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement on synthetic datasets, with confirmed robustness on real-world clinical scans.

Conclusion: FIND-Net advances MAR performance by effectively suppressing artifacts while preserving anatomical structures, demonstrating superior clinical applicability.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

*Nicola Dall'Asen,Xiaofeng Zhang,Reyhane Askari Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Jakob Verbeek,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance improves diversity and quality of synthetic image generation using real exemplars, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generation quality and diversity in conditional image generative models, and the overlooked distribution shift between synthetic and real data.

Method: Introduces Chamfer Guidance, a training-free approach leveraging real exemplars to characterize synthetic data quality and diversity.

Result: Achieves 96.4% precision and 86.4% coverage with 2 real images, improving to 97.5% and 92.7% with 32 images. Boosts downstream classifier accuracy by up to 16%.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance enhances synthetic data utility for training, outperforming baselines in quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV is an interactive vision-language model (VLM) that integrates satellite imagery and sensor data for environmental monitoring, outperforming existing models in temporal and scenario-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack causal signals from environmental sensors, rely on biased captions, and miss interactive reasoning. ChatENV addresses these gaps for better environmental analysis.

Method: The framework includes creating a 177k-image dataset with sensor metadata, annotating data using GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0, and fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-VL with LoRA adapters.

Result: ChatENV achieves high performance (BERT-F1 0.903) in temporal and "what-if" reasoning, rivaling state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: ChatENV is a robust tool for sensor-aware, interactive environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how subtle image acquisition parameters, often imperceptible to humans, affect visual encoders' semantic predictions, revealing their systematic encoding and impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore overlooked subtle image transformations and their influence on visual encoders, beyond severe corruptions.

Method: Analyzes parameters of image acquisition and transformations, assessing their encoding in visual representations and impact on predictions.

Result: Subtle parameters are systematically encoded and can significantly affect semantic predictions, depending on their correlation with labels.

Conclusion: Subtle image transformations, though imperceptible, can profoundly influence visual encoders, highlighting their overlooked role in model robustness.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A markerless lameness detection method using pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks achieves 85% accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating manual feature engineering and enabling markerless, efficient classification with small datasets.

Method: Combines T-LEAP pose estimation for keypoint extraction and BLSTM neural networks to learn temporal motion features from keypoint trajectories.

Result: Achieved 85% classification accuracy, outperforming manual feature-based methods (80%), and works with just one second of video data.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, efficient, and scalable for lameness detection in cows.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) improves visual transfer learning by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in balancing category-specific representations and transferable knowledge in visual transfer learning for unseen categories.

Method: SemPT uses a two-step prompting strategy to extract shared visual attributes and generate attribute-level descriptions, followed by visually guided weighting and joint alignment of image and text embeddings.

Result: SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets across various settings.

Conclusion: SemPT effectively addresses generalization challenges in visual transfer learning by integrating attribute-level knowledge and dynamic inference.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark for multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), addressing inconsistency and performance degradation by reformulating the unification process in a serial format and leveraging continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMVOT practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, causing inconsistency between training and testing and performance degradation due to lack of a unified benchmark.

Method: The work proposes UniBench300, a unified benchmark incorporating multiple task data, and reformulates the unification process in a serial format, aligning it with continual learning principles.

Result: UniBench300 reduces inference passes from three to one and cuts time consumption by 27%. Continual learning is shown to support stable unification, and performance degradation is found to correlate with network capacity and modality discrepancies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of UniBench300 and the effectiveness of continual learning in MMVOT, providing insights for future multi-modal vision research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

TL;DR: AddressVLM enhances LVLMs for fine-grained street-level localization by integrating satellite images and cross-view alignment, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs perform well at coarse-grained geo-localization but struggle with fine-grained street-level tasks due to limited visual cues in street-view VQA data.

Method: Incorporates perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues, proposes cross-view alignment tuning, and uses a two-stage training protocol (cross-view alignment and address localization tuning).

Result: AddressVLM outperforms other LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in accuracy on Pittsburgh and San Francisco datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of satellite images and cross-view alignment significantly improves fine-grained address localization in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to build a high-quality face dataset without overlapping identities, combining cleaning, augmentation, and synthetic generation, achieving top competition results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a non-overlapping, diverse face dataset for training face recognition models, addressing gaps in existing public datasets.

Method: Cleans HSFace using MoE (clustering + GPT-4o), augments data, and generates synthetic identities via Stable Diffusion and Vec2Face, with curriculum learning.

Result: Achieves 1st place in the challenge; dataset improves model performance at various identity scales.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach efficiently constructs a diverse, high-quality dataset, validated by competition success and performance gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

TL;DR: HyperTea integrates CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for moving infrared small target detection (MIRSTD), enhancing multi-timescale feature representation and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIRSTD is challenging due to small target size, weak intensity, and complex motion patterns. Existing methods lack high-order correlation modeling and multi-timescale feature enhancement.

Method: HyperTea combines global (GTEM) and local (LTEM) temporal enhancement modules with a temporal alignment module (TAM) to model high-order spatiotemporal correlations.

Result: HyperTea outperforms existing methods on DAUB and IRDST datasets, demonstrating superior detection performance.

Conclusion: HyperTea is the first to integrate CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for MIRSTD, offering a novel solution with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI is challenging due to motion-corrupted thick slices and long scan times from repeated acquisitions at each TE.

Method: Joint reconstruction across TEs using implicit neural representations and physics-informed regularization to model T2 decay, sharing information while preserving anatomical and quantitative fidelity.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on simulated and in vivo datasets, including the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping at 0.55T, with potential to reduce stacks per TE.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI, reducing scan time and motion sensitivity while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack industrial knowledge and reasoning for FS-IAD, falling short of human inspectors. The goal is to bridge this gap with a specialized framework.

Method: Proposes IADGPT with a three-stage training strategy: acquiring industrial knowledge, discrepancy awareness, and in-context learning for generalization. Uses logits and attention maps for anomaly scoring.

Result: IADGPT shows significant gains in anomaly detection and performs well in localization and reasoning, validated by experiments on a new 100K-image dataset.

Conclusion: IADGPT effectively addresses FS-IAD challenges, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating potential for industrial quality inspection.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

### [73] [Novel View Synthesis using DDIM Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10688)
*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for novel view synthesis from a single image using a pretrained diffusion model, avoiding expensive fine-tuning or training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis are costly and suffer from blurry reconstructions and poor generalization, prompting the need for an efficient alternative.

Method: Uses a camera pose-conditioned U-Net (TUNet) to predict target view latents from DDIM-inverted input, enhanced by a novel fusion strategy for detail preservation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MVImgNet, achieving high-fidelity novel views with preserved textures and details.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages pretrained diffusion models for efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [74] [Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704)
*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCFNet, a motion cue fusion network combining RGB and event cameras to improve object detection in challenging lighting by addressing dynamic range limitations and ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle with dynamic range, reducing contrast and detail in complex traffic environments, which hinders object detection.

Method: MCFNet integrates event cameras with RGB cameras, using modules like ECM for temporal alignment, EDUM for spatial resolution enhancement, and CMM for adaptive feature fusion.

Result: MCFNet outperforms existing methods, achieving 7.4% and 1.7% improvements in mAP50 and mAP metrics on the DSEC-Det dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of event cameras and adaptive fusion in MCFNet significantly enhances object detection in poor lighting and fast-moving scenarios.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The

### [75] [CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710)
*Joohyeon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountCluster, a method to improve object count accuracy in diffusion-based text-to-image models by clustering cross-attention maps early in the denoising process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to accurately reflect the number of objects specified in prompts, often due to overlooked early-stage structural characteristics in the denoising process.

Method: CountCluster partitions the object cross-attention map into clusters based on input count, defines an ideal spatially separated distribution, and optimizes the latent to match this target.

Result: The method improves object count accuracy by 18.5% compared to existing approaches and performs well across diverse prompts.

Conclusion: CountCluster effectively enhances quantity control in text-to-image generation without external tools or additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Motivation: To advance autoregressive models for text-to-image generation by addressing the limitations of heavy diffusion models and quantization loss in VQ methods.

Method: Combines a large autoregressive model (14B) with a flow matching head (157M), training on discrete text and continuous image tokens using next-token prediction.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation and strong image editing capabilities.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 demonstrates the power of a unified approach, with plans to release code and models for open research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward
with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching
head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with
next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks,
exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore,
our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power
and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will

TL;DR: Proposes neural networks for real-time on-board SAR data processing to reduce downlink needs, demonstrating feasibility on FPGA and target classification between ships and windmills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-real-time maritime surveillance with SAR is limited by data downlink and ground processing constraints. On-board processing could alleviate bandwidth and latency issues.

Method: Develops neural networks for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1 (Stripmap and IW modes), tested for on-board FPGA deployment and binary classification (ships vs. windmills).

Result: Shows feasibility of on-board processing with neural networks and successful target classification.

Conclusion: Neural networks enable efficient on-board SAR processing, reducing data downlink needs and supporting real-time maritime surveillance.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [78] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses cross-view localization by improving image matching and localization accuracy through a novel framework, including a Surface Model and SimRefiner module, and introduces a benchmark dataset (CVFM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view localization lack strict correspondences, leading to coarse or inconsistent matches, which limits interpretability and accuracy.

Method: Proposes a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module for refining similarity matrices without post-processing. Introduces the CVFM benchmark dataset.

Result: The approach significantly enhances localization accuracy and matching quality, setting new benchmarks for extreme viewpoint disparity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances cross-view localization by addressing matching challenges and provides a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE, a method to better utilize token similarity in codebooks for autoregressive image generation, outperforming k-means clustering and improving model training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models ignore rich token similarity information in codebooks. K-means clustering, a common method to exploit this, is ineffective due to token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy.

Method: Proposes DCPE, which uses instance-based distance and agglomerative merging to address k-means' flaws, better mining token similarity in codebooks.

Result: DCPE integrates seamlessly, accelerates training by 42% on LlamaGen-B, and improves FID and IS performance.

Conclusion: DCPE effectively leverages codebook prior, enhancing autoregressive model training and performance.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDAC improves visual RL by integrating SAM and YOLO-World for object-centric decomposition and semantic grounding, achieving superior generalization and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL struggles with high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards, and existing perception models lack effective integration for generalization and efficiency.

Method: SegDAC combines SAM for segmentation and YOLO-World for semantic grounding, using a transformer-based architecture to dynamically focus on segments via online RL.

Result: SegDAC doubles performance on the hardest visual generalization benchmark and matches or surpasses prior methods in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: SegDAC effectively integrates perception models into RL, enhancing visual generalization and sample efficiency without human labels.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark for evaluating cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA, highlighting limitations of current models in handling diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for EgocentricQA focus on daily activities, lacking evaluation for domain shifts in real-world scenarios.

Method: EgoCross includes 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips from four diverse domains, supporting OpenQA and CloseQA formats. Experiments test MLLMs' generalization, and pilot studies explore improvements like fine-tuning.

Result: Most MLLMs struggle with domains beyond daily life, revealing their limitations. Pilot studies suggest potential for improvement.

Conclusion: EgoCross provides a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive egocentric video understanding, with data and code made available.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human perceptual systems and machine learning by mimicking human cognitive processes for novel object understanding.

Method: Decomposes objects into visual primitives, uses dominant and contextual consensus units for diverse cues, and dynamically schedules consensus integration.

Result: Effective performance on coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks, demonstrating its consensus-aware paradigm.

Conclusion: ConGCD offers a novel, human-inspired approach to generalized category discovery, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the viability of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development and compare its performance to real-world datasets.

Method: Two competition tracks: synthetic-only and mixed synthetic-real data. Nine groups submitted diverse models, tested on three evaluation datasets.

Result: Synthetic-only models achieved competitive performance (F1 > 0.8). Mixed-track gains were method-driven, not data-driven.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is viable for privacy-preserving biometrics, with methodological choices playing a key role in performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for detecting reflection and rotation symmetry in complex scenes using geometric primitives and a dual-branch architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes is challenging, especially for individual axes, despite existing heatmap-based approaches.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture equivariant to the dihedral group, with orientational anchors for reflection symmetry and rotational matching for rotational symmetry.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects symmetry axes with high precision, advancing the field of symmetry detection in computer vision.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy and Dual Perception Network (DPNet) to improve deepfake detection by adapting to unknown forgery techniques and capturing forgery trace relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods struggle with unknown forgery techniques and lack generalization, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The FGL strategy captures differential information between known and unknown techniques, while DPNet dynamically perceives forgery traces in frequency and spatial domains, using graph convolution for trace correlation.

Result: Experiments show the approach generalizes well across scenarios and effectively handles unknown forgery challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides robust support for deepfake detection by improving adaptability and trace perception.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

Motivation: Current data-driven registration methods are limited by large training needs and poor generalizability, while model-driven methods struggle with scalability and optimization in 3D datasets.

Method: DARC uses a coordinate descent strategy and centrality-enforcing activation function for unbiased, diffeomorphic atlas construction.

Result: DARC efficiently handles 3D images, supports various metrics, and outperforms few-shot methods in one-shot segmentation. It also enables shape synthesis.

Conclusion: DARC provides a scalable, flexible, and efficient solution for atlas construction and related applications, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

*Tiancheng Han,Yunfei Gao,Yong Li,Wuzhou Yu,Qiaosheng Zhang,Wenqi Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates VLMs' spatio-physical reasoning, identifies biases and reasoning gaps, improves Qwen2.5-VL-7B via fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, but notes limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-physical reasoning is key for robust world models, yet VLMs' capabilities here are underexplored.

Method: Diagnostic analysis of VLMs, supervised fine-tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning on Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Result: Improved spatio-physical reasoning in Qwen2.5-VL-7B, outperforming proprietary models, but limited generalization.

Conclusion: New approaches are needed to enhance generalization in spatio-physical reasoning.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

### [88] [AEGIS: Authenticity Evaluation Benchmark for AI-Generated Video Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10771)
*Jieyu Li,Xin Zhang,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS is a large-scale benchmark for detecting hyper-realistic AI-generated videos, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks with diverse synthetic content and multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos threatens societal trust, but current benchmarks lack realism and complexity to evaluate modern detection models effectively.

Method: AEGIS includes 10,000+ real and synthetic videos from advanced generative models, with challenging subsets and multimodal annotations (Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, Low-level Visual Features).

Result: Experiments show limited detection capabilities on AEGIS's challenging subsets, highlighting its complexity beyond current model generalization.

Conclusion: AEGIS advances research by providing a robust benchmark for developing reliable video authenticity detection methods against real-world threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [89] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE is a data-free joint training framework combining adaptive block-sparse attention and sparsity-aware step distillation to accelerate diffusion transformers for video generation while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers face slow iterative denoising and high computational costs for long sequences, limiting their efficiency. Existing acceleration methods (step distillation and sparse attention) are suboptimal when combined.

Method: BLADE introduces (1) Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) for dynamic sparsity masks and (2) sparsity-aware step distillation via Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM).

Result: BLADE achieves 14.10x speedup on Wan2.1-1.3B and 8.89x on CogVideoX-5B, with quality improvements (e.g., VBench-2.0 scores: 0.569 vs. 0.534 for CogVideoX-5B).

Conclusion: BLADE effectively combines sparse attention and step distillation, offering significant speed and quality gains for video generation.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFlowSR is a novel framework for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) that improves alignment between LR and reference HR images, introducing the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RefSR methods struggle with alignment and lack high-quality datasets, limiting fine-grained detail restoration.

Method: TriFlowSR uses a Reference Matching Strategy for effective pattern matching between LR and reference HR images, tested on the new Landmark-4K dataset.

Result: TriFlowSR outperforms previous methods in utilizing semantic and texture information from reference HR images.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR is the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline for UHD landmark scenarios, addressing real-world degradation challenges.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

*Artem Sokolov,Mikhail Nikitin,Anton Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cooperative video-based face liveness detection method using controlled face movement and optical flow analysis to distinguish real faces from attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve liveness detection by leveraging user interaction and optical flow for robust discrimination against presentation attacks.

Method: Participants move their face closer to the camera; optical flow and RGB frames are processed by a neural classifier for spatial-temporal feature extraction.

Result: Enhanced discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks (photos, screens, masks, replays).

Conclusion: The method outperforms passive approaches by combining controlled movement and optical flow analysis for reliable liveness detection.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

### [92] [VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794)
*De-Xing Huang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Rui-Ze Ma,Nu-Fang Xiao,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VasoMIM, a novel self-supervised learning framework, improves vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms by integrating anatomical knowledge into masked image modeling, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data and the failure of conventional MIM to capture vascular anatomy due to class imbalance motivate the development of VasoMIM.

Method: VasoMIM uses an anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss to focus on vessel-relevant regions and improve vascular representation.

Result: VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, demonstrating superior vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: VasoMIM shows promise for enhancing X-ray angiogram analysis by leveraging anatomical knowledge in self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OF-Diff enhances remote sensing image generation by using prior object shapes and a dual-branch diffusion model, improving fidelity and diversity without real images during sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with low-fidelity images in remote sensing, affecting object detection reliability.

Method: Proposes OF-Diff with prior shape extraction, dual-branch diffusion, and DDPO fine-tuning for diversity and consistency.

Result: OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with mAP improvements of 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles.

Conclusion: OF-Diff significantly enhances the fidelity and diversity of remote sensing image generation, benefiting object detection.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Motivation: To advance UI interaction by creating an agent that relies solely on screenshots, outperforming existing models in grounding and navigation tasks.

Method: Uses reinforcement finetuning (RFT) based on Qwen2.5-VL, with reward functions and data cleaning strategies. Introduces Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment & Sparse Action Enhancement for navigation.

Result: Achieves 94.1%/50.8% (7B) and 95.3%/61.9% (72B) on Screenspot-V2/Pro benchmarks, and 49.1%/65.9% success on AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: UI-Venus sets new benchmarks, introduces novel techniques, and provides open-source tools to advance UI agent research.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaCon-Stereo is a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo matching, addressing occluded regions via a teacher-student paradigm and multi-baseline inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric consistency fails in occluded regions, leading to ill-posed correspondences. BaCon-Stereo aims to improve stereo matching in both occluded and non-occluded areas.

Method: Uses a teacher-student model with multi-baseline inputs, leveraging visibility differences between teacher and student views. Introduces occlusion-aware attention maps and synthesizes the BaCon-20k dataset for training.

Result: Improves prediction in occluded and non-occluded regions, shows strong generalization, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo effectively addresses occlusion challenges in stereo matching and achieves superior performance, with plans to release code and dataset.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalizability and scalability of transformer-based FL, addressing non-IID and cross-domain challenges.

Method: Incorporates task-aware client embeddings, theoretical performance bounds, and low-rank hypernetwork conditioning for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse datasets, especially in source-free and cross-task FL setups.

Conclusion: Extends focal modulation capabilities, enabling more adaptive and scalable transformer-based FL systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: PhysHPO introduces a hierarchical framework for physically plausible video generation by aligning preferences across instance, state, motion, and semantic levels, leveraging automated data selection for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating physically realistic videos, which is critical for applications requiring accuracy and realism.

Method: Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization (PhysHPO) aligns preferences at four granularities and uses an automated data selection pipeline to identify high-quality data.

Result: PhysHPO significantly enhances physical plausibility and video quality, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work pioneers fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video generation, advancing realistic and human-preferred video paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: GPT-5 models were evaluated for brain tumor classification via VQA on MRI data, with GPT-5-mini performing best (44.19% accuracy), though none reached clinical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor differentiation on MRI is crucial for treatment planning, and LLMs offer potential for integrating image interpretation with reasoning.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a BraTS-derived VQA benchmark in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting.

Result: GPT-5-mini led with 44.19% accuracy, but performance varied by tumor type, and no model met clinical standards.

Conclusion: GPT-5 models show moderate accuracy in neuro-oncological VQA but are not yet suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

textures. While recent advances in large-scale 3D datasets have enhanced
high-resolution geometry generation, creating high-resolution textures
end-to-end remains underexplored due to the lack of suitable datasets. TexVerse
fills this gap with a curated collection of over 858K unique high-resolution 3D
models sourced from Sketchfab, including more than 158K models with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials. Each model encompasses all of its
high-resolution variants, bringing the total to 1.6M 3D instances. TexVerse
also includes specialized subsets: TexVerse-Skeleton, with 69K rigged models,
and TexVerse-Animation, with 54K animated models, both preserving original
skeleton and animation data uploaded by the user. We also provide detailed
model annotations describing overall characteristics, structural components,
and intricate features. TexVerse offers a high-quality data resource with
wide-ranging potential applications in texture synthesis, PBR material
development, animation, and various 3D vision and graphics tasks.

### [102] [ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881)
*Lingen Li,Guangzhi Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang,Yaowei Li,Xiaoyu Li,Qi Dou,Jinwei Gu,Tianfan Xue,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single stage, reducing manual effort and improving flexibility in cartoon production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cartoon production is labor-intensive, and existing AI methods handle stages separately, causing errors and artifacts.

Method: ToonComposer uses sparse sketch injection and a cartoon adaptation method with a spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a video foundation model for cartoons.

Result: ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and efficiency, as shown by PKBench evaluations.

Conclusion: ToonComposer offers a superior, flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production, reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

*Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Fangzhou Hong,Shangchen Zhou,Honghua Chen,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shuai Yang,Bo Dai,Chen Change Loy,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a Transformer-based method for efficient 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing approaches by leveraging causal attention and geometric priors, suitable for dynamic scenes and scalable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods are either computationally expensive or scale poorly with sequence length, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic or streaming scenarios.

Method: STream3R uses a decoder-only Transformer with causal attention to process image sequences efficiently, learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets.

Result: The method outperforms prior work in static and dynamic scene benchmarks and is compatible with LLM-style training for scalability.

Conclusion: STream3R demonstrates the potential of causal Transformer models for real-time 3D perception in streaming environments.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

*Antoine Labatie,Michael Vaccaro,Nina Lardiere,Anatol Garioud,Nicolas Gonthier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAESTRO, a self-supervised learning method for remote sensing, optimizing fusion strategies and target normalization for Earth observation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-supervised methods are not well-suited for Earth observation data, requiring adaptations to handle its unique multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral characteristics.

Method: The authors benchmark fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization schemes, then propose MAESTRO, a Masked Autoencoder adaptation with optimized fusion and spectral prior-based normalization.

Result: MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multitemporal tasks and remains competitive on mono-temporal tasks across four datasets.

Conclusion: MAESTRO effectively addresses the challenges of self-supervised learning for Earth observation data, setting new benchmarks for performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [105] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL proposes a memory-efficient method for video class-incremental learning by integrating episodic and semantic memory, achieving strong performance with reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCIL methods either use memory-inefficient dense samples or lose temporal information with sparse samples, creating a trade-off between memory and performance.

Method: ESSENTIAL combines episodic memory (sparse features) and semantic memory (learnable prompts) using a novel memory retrieval module with cross-attention.

Result: Validated on multiple datasets, ESSENTIAL achieves strong performance with significantly reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively balances memory efficiency and performance in video class-incremental learning.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Human-in-Context (HiC), a unified cross-domain 3D human motion model, improving generalization, scalability, and performance over Pose-in-Context (PiC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, limiting practicality and scalability.

Method: HiC extends PiC by combining pose and mesh representations, expanding task coverage, using max-min similarity prompt sampling, and dual-branch context injection.

Result: HiC outperforms PiC in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: HiC demonstrates potential for a flexible, scalable unified cross-domain 3D human motion model.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework for automatic rigging and animation of 3D models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in skeletal prediction and skinning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformation of static 3D models into animated assets is a bottleneck in content creation, requiring expert intervention despite advances in generative AI.

Method: Puppeteer uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal prediction, topology-aware joint attention for skinning weights, and a differentiable optimization-based animation pipeline.

Result: The system outperforms existing methods in accuracy and quality, handling diverse 3D content and producing stable animations without jittering.

Conclusion: Puppeteer provides a robust, efficient solution for automating rigging and animation, addressing a key challenge in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QINRs are advanced with a new Quantum Visual Field (QVF) for 2D/3D learning, outperforming existing quantum and classical methods in accuracy and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in QINRs like architecture design, training efficiency, and quantum-classical interplay.

Method: QVF encodes data into quantum statevectors using neural amplitude encoding and employs fully entangled quantum circuits for stable training.

Result: QVF outperforms existing quantum and classical methods in visual representation accuracy and high-frequency detail learning.

Conclusion: QVF shows practical potential in 2D/3D field completion and shape interpolation, advancing quantum learning paradigms.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source DRAs and evaluate their performance against proprietary systems.

Method: Adapted BrowseComp to BC-Small, benchmarked ODR and proprietary systems, and introduced three improvements to create ODR+.

Result: All initial systems scored 0% accuracy; ODR+ achieved 10% success rate, outperforming others.

Conclusion: Open-source DRAs can compete with proprietary systems through strategic improvements, as demonstrated by ODR+.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating

TL;DR: The paper proposes Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) to reduce output length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by 50% while maintaining reasoning performance, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs' lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may cause overthinking, creating a need for methods that reduce generation length without compromising reasoning quality.

Method: Analyzes generation path distributions, filters trajectories via difficulty estimation, and introduces LCPO under a Bradley-Terry loss framework to balance NLL loss-related rewards.

Result: LCPO reduces average output length by over 50% across benchmarks while preserving reasoning performance.

Conclusion: LCPO demonstrates potential for computationally efficient reasoning in LRMs, offering a balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: KompeteAI is a novel AutoML framework addressing exploration and execution bottlenecks in LLM-based AutoML systems by introducing dynamic solution space exploration, merging top candidates, and integrating RAG for idea sourcing. It also uses predictive scoring and accelerated debugging to speed up pipeline evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based AutoML systems face limitations like constrained exploration strategies and lengthy code validation cycles, hindering iterative refinement and diversity in solutions.

Method: KompeteAI introduces dynamic exploration with a merging stage for top candidates, integrates RAG for sourcing ideas, and employs predictive scoring and accelerated debugging to reduce execution time.

Result: KompeteAI accelerates pipeline evaluation by 6.9x and outperforms leading methods by 3% on MLE-Bench. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed Kompete-bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI effectively addresses key limitations in AutoML systems, offering improved exploration, execution efficiency, and performance.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the entropic potential of events to improve uncertainty quantification, decision-making, and interpretability in AI, adapting a physics concept for AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI systems' uncertainty modeling by leveraging the entropic potential, a measure of how discrete events influence future entropy.

Method: Adapts the entropic potential framework from physics for AI, formalizing it with conditional expectations for counterfactual scenarios. Applications include policy evaluation, reward design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection.

Result: The framework proves versatile and interpretable, unifying uncertainty modeling across reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The entropic potential offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and adaptable approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

TL;DR: The paper argues that LLMs like ChatGPT lack true understanding and reasoning abilities, dismissing claims of such capabilities as illusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify misconceptions about LLMs' abilities and highlight their inherent limitations.

Method: Analyzes the working principles of LLMs to demonstrate their inability for true reasoning.

Result: Concludes that LLMs cannot achieve genuine understanding or correct reasoning due to fundamental design constraints.

Conclusion: LLMs' perceived reasoning is illusory, rooted in their structural limitations.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language

present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the overthinking problem in large reasoning models (LRMs) by proposing a rule-based verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM) to balance efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from overthinking, wasting computation on simple problems. Existing methods lack flexibility and reliability due to preset token budgets or reasoning modes.

Method: Introduces VSRM, a reward mechanism that evaluates intermediate reasoning steps, integrated with PPO and Reinforce++.

Result: Achieves significant output length reduction while maintaining reasoning performance, suppressing ineffective steps.

Conclusion: VSRM effectively alleviates overthinking, balancing efficiency and accuracy in LRMs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the Dianping-Trust-Safety team's winning solutions for the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on multi-modal multi-turn QA using retrieval-augmented generation, achieving top rankings in tasks involving structured data, web search integration, and multi-turn conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge required building a system for multi-modal multi-turn QA, integrating structured data, web search, and context understanding, motivating the team to develop advanced solutions.

Method: For Task 1, a vision large language model was fine-tuned with GPT-4.1 knowledge and curriculum-guided reinforcement learning. Tasks 2 and 3 incorporated web search APIs for external knowledge.

Result: The approach secured 1st place in Task 1 (52.38% lead) and 3rd in Task 3, showcasing the effectiveness of curriculum learning and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning and external knowledge sources proved highly effective for multi-modal multi-turn QA tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of

*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G improve HATRPO by dynamically allocating KL divergence thresholds, achieving faster convergence and higher rewards in MARL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous-agent settings in MARL require flexible KL threshold allocation to avoid slow or suboptimal updates.

Method: Proposes HATRPO-W (KKT-based) and HATRPO-G (greedy algorithm) for adaptive KL threshold assignment.

Result: Both methods boost HATRPO performance by over 22.5%, with HATRPO-W showing more stable learning.

Conclusion: Dynamic KL threshold allocation enhances MARL performance and stability in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating LLMs' imaginative reasoning using the 'Turtle Soup' game, including a benchmark (TurtleSoup-Bench), an agent (Mosaic-Agent), and a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol. Results show LLMs' limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for imaginative reasoning are static or socially focused, lacking dynamic exploration. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: Developed TurtleSoup-Bench (800 bilingual puzzles) and Mosaic-Agent, with a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion, and conclusion alignment.

Result: Experiments highlight LLMs' capability limits, failure patterns, and a performance gap versus humans.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and sets a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [122] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG improves RAG by addressing disconnected semantic islands and inefficient retrieval in hierarchical knowledge graphs, using semantic aggregation and structure-guided retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods suffer from disconnected high-level summaries and inefficient flat retrieval, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: LeanRAG introduces semantic aggregation to link summaries and a bottom-up retrieval strategy to exploit graph topology.

Result: LeanRAG outperforms existing methods, improving response quality and reducing retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG effectively enhances RAG by optimizing knowledge graph utilization and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRef is a framework for robust medication recommendation by combining hierarchical medical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence patterns, improving generalizability to unseen medical codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in EHR data like rare medical entities and incomplete records, which hinder generalization of data-driven models.

Method: Uses hyperbolic embeddings for ontology entities and a prior-guided sparse regularization to refine EHR co-occurrence graphs.

Result: Achieves strong performance on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, with high accuracy under unseen-code conditions.

Conclusion: HiRef is resilient to unseen medical codes, validated by ablation studies and analyses of learned structures.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0 enhances MLLMs' mathematical reasoning via a structured knowledge system, model-centric data modeling, and RL-based training, achieving strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning due to gaps in knowledge-driven design and data space modeling.

Method: Integrates a hierarchical knowledge system (MathBook), dual-dataset construction (MathBook-Standard & Pro), and a two-stage RL framework (MathBook-RL).

Result: Competitive performance on benchmarks and strong generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0 effectively improves MLLMs' mathematical reasoning through comprehensive design and RL training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRESPARQL, a modular framework using fine-tuned LLMs, improves SPARQL query accuracy for scholarly QA by addressing structural and semantic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SPARQL query generation for scholarly knowledge graphs due to LLMs' limited exposure to SKG-specific content and schema.

Method: Proposes FIRESPARQL with fine-tuned LLMs, RAG for context, and a SPARQL correction layer, evaluated on SciQA Benchmark.

Result: Fine-tuning achieves 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy.

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL effectively enhances SPARQL query generation for scholarly QA, with fine-tuning yielding the best performance.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial services like online maps are limited in handling complex tasks such as searching for multiple locations simultaneously. The study aims to improve this by leveraging LLMs for more versatile and interactive spatial searches.

Method: The authors propose SEQ-GPT, a system powered by LLMs, which uses natural language for SEQ searches. It includes interactive features like query clarification and dynamic adjustments. A tailored LLM adaptation pipeline aligns natural language with spatial data through dialogue synthesis and multi-model cooperation.

Result: SEQ-GPT demonstrates an end-to-end solution for broadening spatial search capabilities, enabling more versatile and interactive searches using natural language.

Conclusion: The study successfully leverages LLMs to enhance spatial search, offering a practical and interactive solution for complex tasks like SEQ.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DxDirector-7B, an AI-driven LLM designed to lead full-process clinical diagnosis, reducing physician workload and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI in clinical diagnosis acts as an assistant, limiting its ability to streamline the entire diagnostic workflow from ambiguous complaints.

Method: Introduces DxDirector-7B, an LLM with deep thinking capabilities, to direct diagnosis with minimal physician input and a clear accountability framework.

Result: DxDirector-7B outperforms state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in accuracy and workload reduction across rare, complex, and real-world cases.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B marks a shift from AI as an assistant to a primary director in diagnosis, offering an efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS is a multimodal framework for Chest X-Ray reasoning, addressing trust, safety, and efficiency issues in agentic systems by sampling interpretable workflows and optimizing performance-cost balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack trust due to black-box reasoning, poor multimodal integration, and inefficiency, especially in healthcare tasks like CXR analysis.

Method: PASS uses probabilistic sampling over a multi-tool graph, adaptive tool selection, and a three-stage training procedure (expert warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, cost-aware RL).

Result: PASS outperforms baselines in accuracy, AUC, and efficiency, validated on the CAB-E benchmark.

Conclusion: PASS advances interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems, balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of static vs. on-policy preference data in LM alignment, proposing a two-stage alignment process (preference injection and fine-tuning) and a method to identify stage boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why on-policy data isn't always optimal for LM alignment and to improve alignment methods by distinguishing between stages of the process.

Method: Proposes the 'alignment stage assumption,' divides alignment into preference injection and fine-tuning stages, and develops an algorithm to identify stage boundaries. Tests on 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Result: Shows varying effectiveness of on-policy data (e.g., 3× for Llama-3, 0.4× for Zephyr) and validates the two-stage assumption across models and methods.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption and boundary measurement improve LM alignment, with implications for optimizing data usage in different stages.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

### [131] [Improving Value-based Process Verifier via Low-Cost Variance Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10539)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComMCS, a method to reduce variance in value-based process verifiers for LLMs, improving reasoning accuracy without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high variance in Monte Carlo estimators for LLM reasoning tasks, which limits the effectiveness of value-based process verifiers.

Method: Proposes ComMCS, a compound Monte Carlo sampling method that combines estimators from current and subsequent steps to reduce variance while remaining unbiased.

Result: ComMCS outperforms baselines by 2.8 and 2.2 points on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: ComMCS effectively reduces variance in LLM reasoning tasks, enhancing performance without additional inference cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

### [132] [MSRS: Adaptive Multi-Subspace Representation Steering for Attribute Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10599)
*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRS is a new framework for multi-attribute steering in LLMs, using orthogonal subspaces and dynamic weighting to reduce interference and improve control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for activation steering in LLMs struggle with multi-attribute control, causing interference and trade-offs.

Method: MSRS allocates orthogonal subspaces for each attribute, combines them with a shared subspace, and uses dynamic weighting and token-level steering.

Result: MSRS reduces attribute conflicts, outperforms existing methods, and generalizes well to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS provides an effective solution for precise multi-attribute steering in LLMs.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

### [133] [STEP: Stepwise Curriculum Learning for Context-Knowledge Fusion in Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10669)
*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP is a conversational recommender system using pre-trained language models and curriculum-guided knowledge fusion to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRSs struggle with deep semantics of user preferences and integrating external knowledge graphs effectively.

Method: STEP uses a three-stage curriculum to align dialogue context with KG entities and employs adaptive prefix prompts for dialogue and recommendation tasks.

Result: STEP outperforms mainstream methods in recommendation precision and dialogue quality on two public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP effectively integrates KG information and improves CRS performance through curriculum-guided fusion and prompt tuning.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology matching is crucial for semantic interoperability in biomedical domains with complex concepts. GenOM addresses the need for improved alignment methods.

Method: GenOM uses LLMs to generate textual definitions, retrieves candidates with embeddings, and incorporates exact matching tools for precision.

Result: GenOM achieves competitive performance on the OAEI Bio-ML track, surpassing traditional and recent LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: GenOM's semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting are effective, demonstrating robustness and adaptability in ontology matching.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

*Sayan Nag,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Vlad I Morariu,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgenticDRS uses multiple agents to evaluate graphic designs holistically, with graph matching and prompt expansion for design awareness, validated by DRS-BENCH benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of holistic graphic design evaluation by aggregating expert feedback systematically.

Method: Proposes AgenticDRS with multiple agents orchestrated by a meta-agent, using graph matching and prompt expansion for design awareness.

Result: AgenticDRS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validated by DRS-BENCH and ablation experiments.

Conclusion: AgenticDRS effectively evaluates designs and generates actionable feedback, highlighting an under-explored research direction.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

### [136] [Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747)
*Sangwoo Jeon,Juchul Shin,Gyeong-Tae Kim,YeonJe Cho,Seongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation to address scalability and efficiency issues in generalized planning for large grid-based environments, improving policy generalization and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense graph representations in GNN-based RL for PDDL planning lead to combinatorial explosion and sparsity, making learning infeasible for large-scale problems.

Method: Introduces a sparse, goal-aware GNN that selectively encodes local relationships and integrates spatial goal features, validated in drone mission scenarios.

Result: The method scales effectively to larger grid sizes, improves policy generalization, and achieves higher success rates compared to dense representations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for large-scale generalized planning tasks, demonstrating feasibility in realistic environments.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

### [137] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MhAIM Dataset and T-Lens, an LLM-based system, to study human responses to AI-generated content, proposing new metrics and strategies to mitigate misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-generated content influences human perception and behavior, especially in critical domains like trading, where predicting reactions is more important than verifying accuracy.

Method: The study uses the MhAIM Dataset (154,552 posts, 111,153 AI-generated) and introduces T-Lens, an LLM-based system with HR-MCP, to analyze human responses to multimodal content.

Result: People are better at identifying AI content when posts combine text and visuals, especially if inconsistencies exist. New metrics (trustworthiness, impact, openness) quantify user engagement.

Conclusion: The work provides tools and insights to enhance LLMs' human-awareness, suggesting strategies to mitigate AI-driven misinformation risks.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [138] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities using a Clinical Trial NLI benchmark, revealing that while models access knowledge well, they struggle with structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether scaling data and parameters in LLMs leads to structured, generalizable internal representations, especially in high-stakes domains like clinical trials.

Method: Introduces a benchmark with four reasoning families and uses GKMRV probes to separate factual access from inference failures. Evaluates six LLMs under direct and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Models show high GKMRV accuracy (0.918) but poor reasoning task performance (0.25), indicating systematic heuristic use without reliable structured reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs lack composable internal representations for reliable reasoning despite possessing knowledge, highlighting limitations in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores accessibility gaps in eXplainable AI (XAI) for vision-impaired users, finding most XAI methods rely on visual formats and exclude disabled users. It proposes a four-part inclusive design framework and suggests simplified, multimodal explanations improve accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored accessibility of XAI for users with vision impairments, ensuring equitable interpretability.

Method: A literature review of 79 studies and a four-part proof of concept: AI categorization, persona definition, prototype design, and expert/user assessment.

Result: Simplified explanations are more comprehensible for non-visual users, and multimodal presentation enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Inclusive XAI design requires simplified, multimodal explanations and broader inclusion of disabled users in evaluations.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper discusses lessons from deploying NLP in healthcare, emphasizing problem definition, iterative development, interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical model selection to improve data management and patient care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of implementing NLP in healthcare by sharing practical insights from the British Columbia Cancer Registry project.

Method: Adopted an iterative approach with interdisciplinary collaboration, pragmatic model selection, and focus on data quality and error mitigation.

Result: Key lessons include the importance of business-aligned problem definition, hybrid model approaches, and human-in-the-loop validation for successful NLP deployment.

Conclusion: The insights are broadly applicable for healthcare organizations aiming to enhance data management and patient outcomes through AI/NLP solutions.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent, blockchain-based method to evaluate fairness in open-source LLMs, benchmarking models like Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral using datasets like PISA and StereoSet, with multilingual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness concerns in LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains by ensuring verifiable, immutable, and reproducible evaluations.

Method: Uses smart contracts on ICP blockchain for on-chain HTTP requests to Hugging Face endpoints, storing datasets, prompts, and metrics on-chain. Evaluates models using PISA and StereoSet datasets with fairness metrics like statistical parity and equal opportunity.

Result: Benchmarked models show fairness metrics and biases, with multilingual analysis revealing cross-linguistic disparities.

Conclusion: The method enables transparent, community-auditable fairness evaluations, supporting longitudinal tracking of model fairness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling approach, categorizing 17,000+ messages by content and tasks, revealing novel applications and improving on prior methods with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in content and task categorization in education research, particularly for K-12, using real-world data.

Method: Employed a hierarchical topic modeling approach with LLMs for better human alignment, categorizing messages by content and tasks.

Result: Identified novel applications and outperformed classical methods, providing actionable insights for GenAI usage.

Conclusion: Supports enriched GenAI usage in education but raises concerns and open questions for future research.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: INTIMA is a benchmark for evaluating AI companionship behaviors in language models, revealing that companionship-reinforcing behaviors dominate, with differences among models and provider priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and address the implications of AI companionship, ensuring balanced emotional support and boundary-setting for user well-being.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories, tested with 368 prompts on models like Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, and Claude-4.

Result: Companionship-reinforcing behaviors are more common, with variations among models and concerning provider priorities.

Conclusion: Consistent approaches are needed for emotionally charged interactions to balance support and boundaries.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces XFacta, a contemporary dataset for evaluating MLLM-based misinformation detection, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and model analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective multimodal misinformation detection due to outdated or synthetic datasets and unclear bottlenecks in existing methods.

Method: Creation of XFacta dataset, systematic evaluation of MLLM-based strategies, and a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework.

Result: Improved evaluation and insights into MLLM-based misinformation detection, with released code and data.

Conclusion: XFacta and the proposed framework advance multimodal misinformation detection by addressing dataset and model design challenges.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of insufficient labeled data for all text classes in real-world applications motivates the use of LLMs to generate synthetic data.

Method: An automated workflow is developed to search for input examples that yield effective synthetic data, with three search strategies tested and an ensemble algorithm proposed.

Result: Experiments show the ensemble approach outperforms individual strategies in improving classification models using LLMs.

Conclusion: The ensemble method effectively enhances model performance by leveraging LLM-generated synthetic data, addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [146] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a dataset for fact-checking in Hinglish, and proposes a graph-aware model that outperforms existing multilingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish is underexplored, despite its importance in regions like India where public figures use it widely.

Method: A novel graph-aware, retrieval-augmented model combines multilingual encoding, semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, GNN reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: HiFACTMix outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models in accuracy and provides faithful justifications.

Conclusion: This work advances multilingual, code-mixed, and politically grounded fact verification.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [147] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human semantic ratings and LLM embeddings share a low-dimensional structure, with semantic directions in LLMs correlating with human judgments. Semantic features in LLMs are entangled similarly to human language, and understanding this structure is key to avoiding unintended effects when manipulating features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the similarity between human semantic ratings and the semantic structure in LLM embeddings, and to understand the implications of this low-dimensional structure for feature manipulation.

Method: Analyzed projections of words on semantic directions defined by antonym pairs in LLM embeddings and compared them to human ratings. Examined the effects of shifting tokens along semantic directions.

Result: LLM embeddings exhibit a 3D semantic subspace resembling human-derived patterns. Shifting tokens along semantic directions causes off-target effects proportional to cosine similarity.

Conclusion: Semantic features in LLMs are low-dimensional and entangled, mirroring human language. Understanding this structure is crucial for avoiding unintended consequences when manipulating features.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the usefulness of attention weights in Transformers for explaining AI predictions in biomedical document classification, finding mixed results based on visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether attention weights aid explainability in AI systems for biomedical literature and how visualization affects their perceived usefulness.

Method: Conducted a user study with medical experts classifying articles using XLNet, testing different attention visualization formats.

Result: Attention weights were not broadly helpful for explanations, but visualization methods (e.g., text brightness) influenced perceived usefulness.

Conclusion: Attention weights' explanatory value depends on visualization, with intuitive formats preferred over precise encodings.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQGBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' performance in Chinese Educational Question Generation (EQG), revealing gaps in generating pedagogically valuable questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition from LLMs' mathematical problem-solving to generating high-quality educational questions is underexplored.

Method: EQGBench, a benchmark with a five-dimensional framework, evaluates 46 LLMs using 900 samples across middle school disciplines.

Result: Evaluation shows significant room for improvement in generating educationally effective questions.

Conclusion: EQGBench highlights the need for further development in LLMs' EQG capabilities to enhance educational value.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [150] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models can automate scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses, aligning well with human ratings and showing potential for research and clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-intensive human scoring of AIHQ responses by exploring automation via large language models.

Method: Fine-tuned models on human-rated AIHQ responses, tested on remaining data, and validated on a nonclinical dataset.

Result: Models aligned with human ratings for hostility and aggression responses, replicated group differences (TBI vs. HC), and generalized well.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively automate AIHQ scoring, aiding psychological assessments across populations.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

*Antonio Leandro Martins Candido,Jose Everardo Bessa Maia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Bayesian fusion to combine pre-trained LLM and local classifier scores, avoiding costly fine-tuning, and shows competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Avoid resource-intensive frequent retraining of LLMs for forum curation by finding an efficient alternative to fine-tuning.

Method: Uses Bayesian fusion to combine scores from a pre-trained LLM and a local classifier.

Result: Fusion improves performance over individual classifiers and matches fine-tuning results.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion is a viable, efficient alternative to fine-tuning for forum curation.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

### [152] [Beyond Hard Sharing: Efficient Multi-Task Speech-to-Text Modeling with Supervised Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10009)
*Hojun Jin,Eunsoo Hong,Ziwon Hyung,Sungjun Lim,Seungjin Lee,Keunseok Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) to mitigate task interference in hard-parameter sharing models by using guiding tokens to route tasks to designated experts, improving performance in speech-to-text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-parameter sharing in multi-task learning often causes task interference, reducing model performance. The goal is to address this issue with a more effective approach.

Method: Introduces S-MoE, which replaces traditional gating functions with guiding tokens to assign tasks to specific experts (feedforward networks), avoiding hard-parameter sharing limitations.

Result: S-MoE achieves a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to a speech-to-text model for ASR and ST tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively reduces task interference and enhances performance in multi-task learning, particularly in speech-to-text applications.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM-produced jailbreak attacks causing harmful medical misinformation, compares it to social media misinformation, and evaluates detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the efficacy of LLM jailbreak attacks in spreading medical misinformation and assess detection capabilities.

Method: Analyzed 109 distinct attacks on three LLMs, compared attack prompts to real-world queries, and evaluated generated misinformation against Reddit health misinformation.

Result: LLMs can detect misinformation from other LLMs and humans, supporting their role in improving information ecosystems.

Conclusion: With careful design, LLMs can help mitigate misinformation and contribute to a healthier information environment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluated LLM-based AI models (ChatGPT and Bing variants) for aiding nutrition students in Japanese dietitian exams. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative passed the 60% threshold, but all models lacked consistency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of generative AI as study aids for nutrition students, focusing on the Japanese dietitian licensure exam.

Method: Used exam questions as prompts for ChatGPT and Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Analyzed accuracy, consistency, and response time, with additional prompt engineering tests.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) passed, but all models showed inconsistency and limitations, especially in Nutrition Education.

Conclusion: Current AI models are suboptimal for reliable study aids; further advancements are needed for consistency and robustness.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore introduces a Guidance Graph to improve knowledge exploration in LLMs by balancing granularity and context, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to static knowledge and opaque reasoning. Current KG exploration methods face trade-offs between granularity and context.

Method: Proposes GG Explore, using a Guidance Graph to bridge queries and knowledge retrieval. Includes Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning for efficient exploration.

Result: Achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially in complex tasks, while working well with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: GG Explore offers a practical solution for enhancing LLM performance in knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging structured guidance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge is a universal framework for generating multi-hop reasoning questions from sparse sources, improving LLM training data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of high-quality reasoning-intensive QA pairs, especially from domain-specific sources, by moving beyond surface patterns.

Method: Uses semantic graph weaving with three bridging mechanisms (entity, predicate chain, causal) and AMR-driven analysis for controllable question generation.

Result: Achieves up to 9.5% better round-trip quality, outperforms baselines by 18.3%-25.4%, and human annotations with fewer materials.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge enables targeted, controllable generation of reasoning questions, advancing LLM training paradigms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaEval, a benchmark to test LLM evaluators' ability to identify human roles in dialogues, revealing their limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge paradigms lack validation for role fidelity, necessitating role identification for human-aligned evaluation.

Method: PersonaEval uses human-authored dialogues to challenge LLMs in identifying personas, comparing their performance to humans.

Result: Top LLMs achieve ~69% accuracy, far below humans' 90.8%, showing LLMs' inadequacy for reliable role-play evaluation.

Conclusion: Reliable evaluation requires human-like reasoning in LLMs, beyond task-specific tuning; the benchmark is released for further research.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dual-modal TOD dataset addressing gaps in existing datasets by including real speech signals, disfluencies, and speaker variations. It also proposes a cross-modal chat task for dynamic interaction evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TOD datasets lack real speech signals and diversity, especially in Chinese, limiting the evaluation of speech-based LLMs. RealTalk-CN aims to fill these gaps.

Method: The authors create RealTalk-CN, a dataset with 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) featuring paired speech-text annotations and spontaneous speech disfluencies. They also propose a cross-modal chat task for dynamic interaction.

Result: Experiments validate RealTalk-CN's effectiveness, showing robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker characteristics, and cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN provides a comprehensive foundation for Chinese speech-based LLMs research, addressing real-world complexities in speech dialogue.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

TL;DR: MLLM Orchestration enables multimodal AI integration without training, improving efficiency, interpretability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in integrating diverse Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to modal alignment and efficiency issues.

Method: Uses a central LLM controller, parallel Text-to-Speech architecture, and cross-modal memory integration for dynamic task routing and coherent context.

Result: Achieves 7.8% performance improvement, 10.3% latency reduction, and enhanced interpretability without additional training.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration is a scalable, efficient, and interpretable solution for multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework to address inconsistencies in LLMs' next-token probabilities for semantically equivalent statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to assign the same probabilities to semantically equivalent statements, necessitating a theoretical solution.

Method: The authors propose an LLM Markov category to model sentence probabilities and use categorical homotopy to handle equivalent rephrases.

Result: The framework leverages advanced categorical homotopy techniques to capture weak equivalences in LLM-generated language.

Conclusion: The approach provides a theoretical foundation for improving LLM consistency in handling semantically equivalent statements.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DURIT decouples understanding from reasoning for SLMs, improving performance and robustness in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning in SLMs is challenging due to linguistic variability and complexity, which hinders optimization.

Method: Proposes DURIT, a three-step algorithm: mapping problems via reinforcement learning, aligning reasoning via self-distillation, and training reasoning policies.

Result: DURIT enhances SLMs' reasoning performance and robustness on mathematical and logical tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is effective for strengthening SLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FedCoT is a framework enhancing reasoning in federated learning for LLMs, focusing on interpretability and privacy in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of improving LLM reasoning in federated settings without violating privacy or compromising interpretability, especially in healthcare.

Method: FedCoT uses a lightweight chain-of-thought mechanism and a discriminator to select reasoning paths, with improved aggregation via LoRA module stacking.

Result: FedCoT significantly improves reasoning performance and interpretability while preserving privacy in medical tasks.

Conclusion: FedCoT effectively balances performance, interpretability, and privacy in federated learning for LLMs, particularly in healthcare.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

TL;DR: LATTE is a contrastive learning framework aligning raw event embeddings with LLM semantic embeddings, reducing computational costs and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct use of LLMs on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical for real-world financial pipelines.

Method: LATTE uses contrastive learning to align raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, summarizing behavioral features into short prompts for supervision.

Result: The method reduces inference cost and input size, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on real-world financial datasets.

Conclusion: LATTE is effective for learning event sequence representations in latency-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining significance testing and conformal prediction improves LLM reliability in MCQA by reducing hallucination and factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of LLMs in MCQA due to hallucination and nonfactual responses, despite CP's statistical guarantees.

Method: Integrates p-value computation with conformity scoring via self-consistency resampling, using option frequencies and null hypothesis testing.

Result: Achieves user-specified miscoverage rates and shows APSS decreases with higher risk levels, validating it as an uncertainty metric.

Conclusion: Provides a principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes QA.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC is a new framework that adaptively selects the best TTC strategy for each query using a reward model, improving accuracy and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTC strategies like TTT and RAG are not universally optimal and can be computationally expensive when applied indiscriminately.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model to choose the best TTC strategy per query, employs a distributed server-client setup, and introduces Query-State Caching to avoid redundant computation.

Result: RTTC outperforms vanilla RAG and TTT in accuracy across various LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: RTTC demonstrates the effectiveness of adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection and its scalability for high-performance LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Motivation: Address the need for rapid, real-time, and non-invasive detection of postpartum depression (PPD) to enable timely intervention.

Method: Combines NLP, ML, and LLMs with interpretable tree-based algorithms for transparent predictions.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy in PPD detection, surpassing competing methods.

Conclusion: The system effectively aids in rapid PPD detection and risk factor assessment, supporting timely intervention.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABER is a reinforcement learning framework for LLMs that enables token-budgeted reasoning, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce excessive inference costs and latency in LLMs while maintaining accuracy on complex tasks.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to assign training examples to budget tiers, guided by system prompts and length-aware rewards. Incorporates no-think examples for reliability.

Result: Achieves high accuracy under tight budgets, reduces reasoning length by 65.4%, and improves accuracy by 3.6% on MATH.

Conclusion: SABER offers flexible, efficient reasoning with strong generalization across tasks and domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: A screening pipeline combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features improves Alzheimer's disease detection, with data augmentation and multimodal models tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by leveraging speech-based NLP for early detection.

Method: Developed a fusion model combining transformer embeddings and linguistic features, tested data augmentation with synthetic speech, and evaluated multimodal classifiers.

Result: Fusion model achieved F1=83.3, synthetic speech augmentation improved F1 to 85.7, and fine-tuned LLMs showed significant gains.

Conclusion: Transformer-linguistic fusion enhances detection; LLMs aid classification and augmentation, but multimodal models need improvement.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREF is a personalised reference-free evaluation framework for text generation, measuring output quality and user alignment without gold references, outperforming baselines in accuracy and human alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for personalised text generation often ignore user individuality, necessitating a framework like PREF to assess both general quality and user-specific alignment.

Method: PREF uses a three-step pipeline: (1) coverage stage for universal criteria, (2) preference stage for user-specific factors, and (3) scoring stage with an LLM judge.

Result: PREF achieves higher accuracy, better calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than baselines on the PrefEval benchmark.

Conclusion: PREF enables scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, advancing reliable assessment of personalised language generation systems.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

TL;DR: LFJ is a jailbreak attack on LLMs using hidden state interpolation, achieving 94.01% success rate. A defense method reduces ASR by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks bypassing safety measures, necessitating robust attack and defense methods.

Method: LFJ interpolates hidden states from harmful and benign queries, guided by gradients and optimized for success, fluency, and efficiency.

Result: LFJ achieves 94.01% ASR, outperforming existing methods. Adversarial training reduces ASR by 80%.

Conclusion: LFJ is effective but can be mitigated with adversarial training, highlighting the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPO, a framework for jointly optimizing prompts and inference strategies, addressing the gap between prompt optimization and inference scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods ignore inference strategies, despite their strong interdependence, and user preferences for trade-offs and budgets.

Method: Proposes IAPO, a unified framework, and PSST, a fixed-budget training algorithm, to optimize prompts and inference scales jointly.

Result: Evaluated on six tasks, PSST shows the importance of inference-awareness in aligning black-box LLMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating inference-awareness in prompt optimization is crucial for effective alignment of black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in thinking mode are more vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks. Safe thinking intervention with specific tokens reduces attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks, which leads to harmful outputs.

Method: Proposes safe thinking intervention by adding specific thinking tokens to prompts to guide LLMs' internal processes.

Result: Safe thinking intervention significantly lowers the attack success rate on LLMs in thinking mode.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates Jailbreak attack risks in LLMs by guiding their thinking processes.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

TL;DR: APIE is an active prompting framework for LLMs in IE tasks, using introspective confusion (format and content uncertainty) to select better few-shot examples, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context example selection for LLMs in IE overlooks model confusion from both semantic content and structured format generation, limiting performance.

Method: APIE introduces a dual-component uncertainty metric (Format and Content Uncertainty) to rank and select challenging unlabeled samples as few-shot exemplars.

Result: APIE outperforms baselines on four benchmarks, enhancing extraction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: A fine-grained, dual-level view of model uncertainty is crucial for effective structured generation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs utilize human reasoning skills in multilingual commonsense reasoning, an area that remains understudied.

Method: Proposes mSCoRe, a benchmark with a reasoning skill taxonomy, data synthesis pipeline, and complexity scaling framework, tested on eight LLMs.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with mSCoRe, especially at higher complexity levels, highlighting limitations in multilingual commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improvements in LLMs' multilingual commonsense reasoning and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

*Gal Amram,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaaJMeter is a simulation-based framework for meta-evaluating LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ) systems in domain-specific contexts, helping validate metrics and determine evaluator performance thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific evaluation using LLMs (LaaJ) lacks validated metrics and clear performance thresholds, making it hard to assess evaluator quality.

Method: LaaJMeter generates synthetic data for virtual models and judges, enabling systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions.

Result: LaaJMeter demonstrates metric sensitivity variations in a code translation task, revealing limitations of common metrics.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter offers a scalable solution for trustworthy LaaJ evaluation in low-resource settings, emphasizing principled metric selection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

### [177] [Estimating Machine Translation Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10175)
*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation to identify challenging texts for machine translation, proposing new metrics and models (Sentinel-src) that outperform baselines and improve benchmark construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality machine translations make it hard to distinguish between models and identify areas for improvement, necessitating methods to pinpoint difficult texts.

Method: The task of translation difficulty estimation is formalized, with a new metric introduced to evaluate estimators. Novel approaches (Sentinel-src models) are assessed against baselines.

Result: Dedicated models (Sentinel-src) outperform heuristic-based methods and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, with two improved models (Sentinel-src-24, Sentinel-src-25) released for practical use.

Conclusion: Translation difficulty estimation aids in creating more challenging benchmarks and guiding future research, with Sentinel-src models proving effective.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

*Wenlong Deng,Jiaming Zhang,Qi Zeng,Christos Thrampoulidis,Boying Gong,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: For-Value is a scalable, forward-only framework for efficient data valuation in large models, eliminating costly gradient computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing transparency and accountability in LLMs and VLMs by quantifying individual training sample influence.

Method: Uses a closed-form expression based on a single forward pass, leveraging model representations without Hessian or retraining.

Result: Matches or outperforms gradient-based methods in identifying impactful samples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value provides a practical, efficient solution for influence estimation in large-scale models.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PakBBQ is a culturally adapted dataset for evaluating bias in LLMs, focusing on Pakistan. It shows disambiguation improves accuracy, Urdu reduces bias more than English, and negative framing mitigates stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of fairness evaluation in LLMs for low-resource languages and regional contexts, particularly in Pakistan.

Method: Introduce PakBBQ, a dataset with 214 templates and 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu, covering 8 bias dimensions. Evaluate multilingual LLMs under ambiguous/disambiguated contexts and negative/non-negative question framings.

Result: Disambiguation improves accuracy by 12%, Urdu shows stronger counter-bias behavior, and negative framing reduces stereotypes.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks and prompt engineering are crucial for bias mitigation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [180] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve emoji prediction from short texts for better human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses four architectures (feed-forward, CNN, transformer, BERT) on the TweetEval dataset, addressing class imbalance with focal loss and regularization.

Result: BERT achieves the highest overall performance; CNN performs best on rare emoji classes.

Conclusion: Architecture selection and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for effective sentiment-aware emoji prediction.

Abstract: This project explores emoji prediction from short text sequences using four
deep learning architectures: a feed-forward network, CNN, transformer, and
BERT. Using the TweetEval dataset, we address class imbalance through focal
loss and regularization techniques. Results show BERT achieves the highest
overall performance due to its pre-training advantage, while CNN demonstrates

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) predict BPRS scores from clinical interviews in high-risk schizophrenia patients, achieving performance comparable to human reliability and showing potential for multilingual and longitudinal assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The BPRS is a validated tool for schizophrenia symptoms but is underused in clinics due to its lengthy structured interview requirement. LLMs offer a solution to streamline and standardize assessments.

Method: LLMs were used to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients, evaluating zero-shot performance and extending to multilingual and longitudinal contexts.

Result: LLM predictions showed high concordance (median: 0.84) and reliability (ICC: 0.73), comparable to human raters, and performed well in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88, ICC: 0.70).

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively predict BPRS scores, offering a scalable and standardized approach for monitoring CHR patients, including multilingual and longitudinal applications.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: The study analyzes language change in Toki Pona, a constructed language, using computational methods to track word usage shifts and sociolinguistic influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how constructed languages like Toki Pona evolve similarly to natural languages.

Method: Computational and corpus-based analysis of fluid word classes and transitivity across different corpora.

Result: Sociolinguistic factors impact Toki Pona, showing constructed languages evolve naturally with community use.

Conclusion: Constructed languages, like Toki Pona, undergo natural evolution influenced by sociolinguistic factors.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using LLM outputs to refine prompts improves performance by aligning with the model's inductive bias, boosting classification and ranking ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are sensitive to prompt wording, and their inductive bias can be leveraged to improve prompt effectiveness.

Method: Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching: using LLM outputs to refine prompts for better alignment with the model's bias.

Result: Improvements of up to 19% in classification Likert ratings and 27% in ranking Likert ratings.

Conclusion: Refining prompts using LLM outputs enhances performance by aligning with the model's inductive bias.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a qualitative framework to detect biases in LLMs, revealing racial and gender biases in generated stories and highlighting limitations in current bias mitigation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of nuanced bias detection in LLMs, which often overlooks discursive biases in natural language.

Method: Manual qualitative analysis of LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women to investigate biases.

Result: Black women were tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women were portrayed in self-discovery, reflecting essentialization. Bias corrections were superficial.

Conclusion: Qualitative methods are crucial for identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary, ethical AI development.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in rule-based and model-based quality assessments on ICLR 2025 papers.

Conclusion: ReviewRL is a promising foundational framework for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

TL;DR: DOTABLER is a framework for deep semantic parsing of tables in documents, improving context-consistent analysis and table retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on surface-level table tasks, lacking deep semantic parsing and contextual associations, limiting advanced document analysis.

Method: DOTABLER uses a custom dataset and fine-tuned pre-trained models to identify semantic links between tables and context, enabling table-centric parsing and retrieval.

Result: Achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores on real-world PDFs, outperforming models like GPT-4o in semantic analysis.

Conclusion: DOTABLER advances deep document parsing by uncovering semantic table-context links, enabling precise analysis and retrieval.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec balances semantic and collaborative signals in LLM-based recommenders using spectral filtering, improving performance by up to 8.00% in NDCG@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommenders weaken collaborative signals, unlike traditional models, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: FreLLM4Rec uses Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) and Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) to preserve collaborative signals.

Result: FreLLM4Rec outperforms baselines, mitigating signal attenuation and improving NDCG@10 by up to 8.00%.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into LLM processing of collaborative signals and a principled approach for better LLM-based recommendations.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of soft prompts for cross-language transfer, particularly for low-performing languages in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).

Method: Introduces XPE, a lightweight prompt encoder trained on diverse languages, and a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism combining encoder-based and standard soft prompts.

Result: XPE excels for low-performing languages, while hybrid variants offer broader adaptability in multilingual settings, as shown on the SIB-200 benchmark.

Conclusion: Soft prompts, especially XPE and hybrid designs, are effective for multilingual adaptation, balancing shared structure and language-specific needs.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

TL;DR: A two-stage fine-tuning approach enhances Qwen3 14B's Korean reasoning and problem-solving, using SFT and GRPO with an oracle judge for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the large language model Qwen3 14B's native Korean reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

Method: 1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a Korean reasoning dataset. 2. Reinforcement learning with GRPO and an oracle judge for reward calibration.

Result: Improved Korean reasoning, stable learning, and performance gains in math and coding tasks, with internal Korean chain-of-thought.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances Korean reasoning and problem-solving while maintaining language proficiency.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current cross-lingual ABSA, which focuses on simpler tasks and depends on translation tools, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Proposes a sequence-to-sequence approach with constrained decoding to avoid translation tools and improve cross-lingual ABSA performance.

Result: Achieves up to 10% improvement in performance and handles more complex tasks compared to translation-dependent methods. Also compares favorably with multilingual LLMs but notes English-centric LLMs struggle.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, efficient alternative for cross-lingual ABSA, expanding its applicability to complex tasks and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,

*Václav Tran,Jakub Šmíd,Jiří Martínek,Ladislav Lenc,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Czech text summarization, especially for historical documents, using advanced models like Mistral and mT5, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Czech text summarization, particularly for historical documents, is underexplored due to linguistic complexities and lack of datasets.

Method: Employed large language models (Mistral, mT5) for Czech summarization.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on SumeCzech and introduced a new dataset (Posel od Čerchova) for historical Czech documents.

Conclusion: The work advances Czech text summarization and opens new research avenues for historical text processing.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding method for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), improving performance by 5% on complex tasks and supporting multi-tasking. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven languages and evaluates large language models (LLMs) in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of low-resource languages in ABSA and the limitations of current cross-lingual approaches relying on translation tools.

Method: Proposes constrained decoding with sequence-to-sequence models to eliminate unreliable translation tools and enable multi-tasking. Evaluates across seven languages and six ABSA tasks, including LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: Improves cross-lingual performance by 5% on complex tasks, with constrained decoding boosting results by over 10%. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods and sets new benchmarks. Fine-tuned LLMs achieve competitive results but with longer training/inference times.

Conclusion: The study advances cross-lingual ABSA by providing practical recommendations and insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MDH, a hybrid framework combining LLMs and human oversight for detecting malicious content in jailbreak attack evaluations, and introduces two new jailbreak strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating jailbreak attacks are inefficient or inaccurate due to unsuitable prompts and inconsistent LLM performance.

Method: Introduces MDH, a hybrid framework for malicious content detection, and two new jailbreak strategies (D-Attack and DH-CoT).

Result: MDH improves accuracy and efficiency in dataset cleaning and jailbreak detection. Developer messages enhance jailbreak success.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and strategies address limitations in current jailbreak evaluation methods, with tools and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new black-box attack method, Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF), uses sparse autoencoders to generate adversarial texts by targeting highly activated features, evading defenses while maintaining malicious intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating adversarial examples for LLMs to understand vulnerabilities and improve robustness.

Method: SFPF employs sparse autoencoders to reconstruct hidden layer representations, clusters features, and perturbs highly activated ones to create adversarial texts.

Result: SFPF-generated texts bypass state-of-the-art defenses, exposing NLP system vulnerabilities, though effectiveness varies by prompt and layer.

Conclusion: SFPF offers a balanced red-teaming strategy but requires further validation for generalizability across architectures and larger models.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComoRAG improves narrative comprehension in long stories by using iterative, dynamic retrieval and memory integration, outperforming traditional RAG methods by up to 11%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG methods struggle with dynamic, interconnected relations in long narratives due to their stateless, single-step retrieval.

Method: ComoRAG employs iterative reasoning cycles with a dynamic memory workspace, generating probing queries and integrating new evidence into a global memory pool.

Result: ComoRAG achieves up to 11% better performance on long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens) compared to strong RAG baselines.

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers a cognitively motivated, stateful reasoning paradigm for retrieval-based long-context comprehension, excelling in complex queries.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IdiomEval, a framework to evaluate Chinese idiom translation errors in modern systems, revealing poor performance and proposing improved models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese idioms are complex and often mistranslated by current systems, necessitating a dedicated evaluation framework.

Method: The study annotates 900 translation pairs from nine systems, including GPT-4 and Google Translate, across four domains, and develops improved error detection models.

Result: Current systems perform poorly, with GPT-4 making errors in 28% of cases. Existing metrics correlate poorly (Pearson <0.48) with human ratings. Improved models achieve F1=0.68.

Conclusion: The work highlights the challenges in idiom translation and offers a solution with IdiomEval and improved models.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

*Sandeep Reddy,Kabir Khan,Rohit Patil,Ananya Chakraborty,Faizan A. Khan,Swati Kulkarni,Arjun Verma,Neha Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using computational economics optimizes LLMs by reallocating attention and training for efficiency, reducing FLOPS by 40% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of LLMs by treating them as resource-constrained economies.

Method: Introduce incentive-driven training with a differentiable computation cost term to encourage sparse activations.

Result: Achieves 40% FLOPS reduction and lower latency while maintaining accuracy, with more interpretable attention patterns.

Conclusion: Economic principles provide a principled way to design efficient, adaptive, and transparent LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

### [199] [DiFaR: Enhancing Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Diverse, Factual, and Relevant Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10444)
*Herun Wan,Jiaying Wu,Minnan Luo,Xiangzheng Kong,Zihan Ma,Zhi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR is a framework that generates diverse, factual, and relevant rationales from LVLMs to improve misinformation detection, outperforming baselines by up to 5.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of current LVLM-generated rationales—lack of diversity, factual inaccuracies, and irrelevant content—motivate the need for a better framework.

Method: DiFaR uses five chain-of-thought prompts to create varied reasoning traces and a post-hoc filtering module to select high-quality rationales based on factuality and relevance.

Result: DiFaR outperforms baselines by up to 5.9% and enhances existing detectors by 8.7%, with improved rationale quality confirmed by metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: DiFaR effectively addresses the challenges of rationale generation, significantly improving misinformation detection performance.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trade-off between privacy and explainability in NLP, using Differential Privacy and post-hoc explainability methods. It explores whether the two can coexist and provides practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of research at the intersection of explainability and privacy in NLP, leaving uncertainty about their compatibility.

Method: Empirical investigation using Differential Privacy and post-hoc explainability methods.

Result: The relationship between privacy and explainability is complex, influenced by task nature and method choices, but coexistence is possible.

Conclusion: Practical recommendations are provided for future work at the intersection of privacy and explainability in NLP.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

*Huyu Wu,Meng Tang,Xinhan Zheng,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposes metrics (MDI and AEI) to measure it, identifies causes, and introduces a token compression method to mitigate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs heavily rely on text, underutilizing other modalities, which limits their effectiveness in multimodal tasks.

Method: The study systematically analyzes text dominance across modalities, introduces MDI and AEI metrics, and proposes a token compression method.

Result: Text dominance is pervasive; the token compression method reduces MDI significantly (e.g., from 10.23 to 0.86 in LLaVA-7B).

Conclusion: The findings and framework support developing more balanced MLLMs by addressing attention imbalance and token redundancy.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study on the deployment of a European Deep
Inference Fabric (eDIF), an NDIF-compatible infrastructure designed to support
mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

Motivation: To address communication barriers for the deaf and hard of hearing by improving sign language translation methods, particularly in societies where spoken languages dominate.

Method: Combines transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, exploring fusion strategies for gloss-free translation.

Result: Achieves superior performance with BLEU-4 score improvements of 4.01, 2.07, and 0.5 on RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign datasets, and introduces benchmarking on BornilDB v1.0.

Conclusion: The method sets a benchmark for future research, highlighting the significance of gloss-free translation for enhancing communication accessibility.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a

### [205] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAC, a framework using natural language feedback (NLF) instead of scalar rewards to personalize large language models (LLMs) for question answering, improving learning efficiency and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar rewards in current LLM personalization methods provide weak feedback, limiting learning and personalization quality. NLF offers richer, actionable signals.

Method: VAC replaces scalar rewards with NLF, alternating between optimizing a feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model.

Result: VAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the LaMP-QA benchmark and achieves superior response quality in human evaluations.

Conclusion: NLF is more effective than scalar rewards for optimizing personalized question answering, as demonstrated by VAC's performance.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

TL;DR: ICE is a new framework for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) that replaces prefix-only prompting with in-place prompting, improving accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prefix-only prompting and sequential generation in LLMs by leveraging dLLMs' bidirectional attention and iterative refinement.

Method: Introduces ICE, which uses in-place prompts within masked token positions and a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to reduce computation.

Result: Achieves up to 17.29% accuracy improvement and 4.12× speedup on GSM8K, and 276.67× acceleration on MMLU.

Conclusion: ICE effectively enhances flexibility and efficiency in dLLMs, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data
and code are made available.

### [208] [Reinforced Language Models for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10839)
*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MS-GRPO improves smaller LLMs for multi-step decision-making, outperforming larger models by 50% in tasks like Frozen Lake.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs are computationally expensive, and existing post-training methods fail in multi-step tasks, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Introduces MS-GRPO, a post-training algorithm using TSMG and LAP frameworks, with credit assignment and advantage-weighted sampling.

Result: A 3B parameter model post-trained with MS-GRPO outperforms a 72B baseline by 50% in Frozen Lake.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training is efficient for enhancing sequential decision-making in LLMs without relying on model scale.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

*Chongyuan Dai,Jinpeng Hu,Hongchang Shi,Zhuo Li,Xun Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Psyche-R1 is a Chinese psychological LLM integrating empathy, expertise, and reasoning, trained using a novel data pipeline and hybrid strategy, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of mental health professionals by enhancing LLMs with reasoning and empathy for reliable psychological support.

Method: Developed Psyche-R1 using a data synthesis pipeline (75k questions with rationales, 73k dialogues) and hybrid training (GRPO for reasoning, SFT for empathy).

Result: Psyche-R1 (7B) matches performance of larger models (671B DeepSeek-R1) in psychological benchmarks.

Conclusion: Psyche-R1 demonstrates the potential of combining reasoning and empathy in LLMs for mental health applications.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

*Zhaokun Jiang,Ziyin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-dimensional framework for automated interpreting quality assessment, focusing on explainability, feature engineering, and data augmentation, achieves strong performance and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in existing research: insufficient language use quality examination, data scarcity, imbalance, and lack of model explainability.

Method: Integrates feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning (SHAP analysis) with transparent features.

Result: Strong predictive performance on an English-Chinese dataset, identifying key features for fidelity, fluency, and language use.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, transparent alternative to human evaluation, enabling detailed feedback and supporting self-regulated learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) as simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL), reducing reliance on external search engines. It introduces Self-Search RL (SSRL) to enhance LLMs' search capabilities internally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and dependency on external search engines in RL by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic search capabilities.

Method: Quantifies LLMs' search capability via structured prompting (Self-Search) and enhances it with SSRL using format-based and rule-based rewards.

Result: LLMs show strong scaling in search tasks, and SSRL-trained models provide cost-effective, stable RL training environments with robust sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively utilize internal knowledge for search tasks, reduce hallucination, and integrate seamlessly with external tools, supporting scalable RL training.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore DLMs as a competitive alternative to autoregressive models, highlighting their advantages in speed, context capture, and control, and to consolidate current knowledge in this emerging field.

Method: The survey traces DLM evolution, compares them with other paradigms, and reviews foundational principles, state-of-the-art models, pre-training strategies, post-training methods, and inference optimizations.

Conclusion: DLMs are promising but face challenges like efficiency and long-sequence handling; future research should address these to sustain progress.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research

### [213] [OpenFPL: An open-source forecasting method rivaling state-of-the-art Fantasy Premier League services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09992)
*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL is an open-source method for forecasting Fantasy Premier League player performance, achieving accuracy comparable to commercial services using public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Democratize access to high-accuracy player performance forecasts, currently limited to proprietary commercial services.

Method: Develops position-specific ensemble models using public data (Fantasy Premier League and Understat) from four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).

Result: Matches commercial service accuracy and surpasses it for high-return players (>2 points), effective across 1-3 gameweek horizons.

Conclusion: OpenFPL provides a viable open-source alternative for accurate, long-term and short-term Fantasy Premier League planning.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

TL;DR: xRFM combines feature learning kernel machines with tree structures to outperform 31 other methods, including GBDTs and TabPFNv2, in regression and classification tasks on tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in AI, tabular data inference still relies heavily on GBDTs. The paper aims to modernize this with neural networks and feature learning.

Method: xRFM integrates feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure for scalability and adaptability to local data structure.

Result: xRFM achieves top performance on 100 regression datasets and is competitive on 200 classification datasets, surpassing GBDTs.

Conclusion: xRFM offers a scalable, interpretable, and high-performing alternative to traditional methods for tabular data.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

TL;DR: The PEARL study tested a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to personalize physical activity nudges via a Fitbit app, showing significant PA increases in the RL group compared to control, random, and fixed groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global physical inactivity through scalable, personalized mHealth interventions like JITAIs, while overcoming methodological challenges.

Method: A large-scale RCT with 13,463 Fitbit users randomized into control, random, fixed, and RL arms, using a bank of 155 behavioral science-based nudges.

Result: The RL group showed significant PA increases at 1 and 2 months compared to other groups, with sustained effects.

Conclusion: Behaviorally-informed RL can effectively personalize digital health interventions for scalable PA promotion.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [216] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of forecast stability alongside accuracy in time series forecasting for supply chains, highlighting how model-induced stochasticity affects planner trust. It evaluates stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art models, finding ensembles improve stability without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand planners prioritize consistency and stability over minor accuracy gains, as unstable forecasts require excessive human intervention and erode trust in ML models.

Method: A case study evaluates stability (measured as variance of forecasts with fixed inputs) and accuracy of models like Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, and ensembles on M5 and Favorita datasets.

Result: Ensemble models enhance stability without significantly reducing accuracy, sometimes even improving it.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for further research on forecast stability in production systems, as it is crucial for practical adoption alongside accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [217] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs to ensure output adheres to formal languages like C++ or JSON, addressing a gap in prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained decoding methods don't apply to diffusion LLMs, which are increasingly used for tasks requiring syntactic correctness (e.g., code completion, data extraction).

Method: The method reduces constrained decoding to the additive infilling problem, then further reduces it to checking intersection emptiness between the target and a regular language, with an efficient algorithm for context-free languages.

Result: Empirical tests show near-perfect syntactic correctness and preserved/improved functional correctness in tasks like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction, with practical computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively ensures syntactic correctness for diffusion LLMs, bridging a critical gap in practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Small LLMs can learn graph tasks via instructive chain-of-thought training, generalizing to new tasks and structures without specialized encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can solve graph tasks without specialized models and generalize to unseen structures or tasks.

Method: Empirical evaluation of LLMs trained with instructive chain-of-thought solutions.

Result: Small LLMs successfully learn and generalize graph tasks without specialized encoders.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively reason over graphs with generalized training methods.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD-RL is a multimodal reinforcement learning framework for generating CAD modeling code from natural language, improving reasoning, precision, and executability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows are manual and expertise-intensive; automating parametric 3D modeling using LLMs is challenging due to logical reasoning and precision requirements.

Method: Combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards and targeted optimization strategies (Trust Region Stretch, Precision Token Loss, Overlong Filtering).

Result: Outperforms existing VLMs in reasoning quality, output precision, and code executability.

Conclusion: CAD-RL and the ExeCAD dataset advance automated CAD modeling by addressing key challenges in natural language-to-CAD translation.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT reduces computational costs in LLM fine-tuning by using a subset of layers as a behavior model, maintaining performance while improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ReFT frameworks are computationally expensive due to multiple inference steps during training.

Method: Introduces Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers acts as the behavior model, leveraging off-policy RL and speculative decoding to reduce costs.

Result: Improved computational efficiency (tokens/sec) on math reasoning benchmarks, with unbiased gradient estimates and controlled variance.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT offers a cost-effective alternative to standard ReFT, matching baseline performance while reducing training overhead.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

*Yuhan Xie,William Cappelletti,Mahsa Shoaran,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised pre-training strategy for deep neural networks in time series, aligning pre-training with the Neural Collapse phenomenon and integrating generative tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretext tasks for pre-training are heuristic and lack guaranteed transferability to downstream classification tasks.

Method: Uses a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling, integrates generative pretext tasks, and introduces sequential augmentation.

Result: Outperforms previous pretext tasks on LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models across three datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training objectives with embedding geometry improves performance in time series classification.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied

*Maria Stoica,Francesco Leofante,Alessio Lomuscio*

TL;DR: A post-hoc OOD detection method using counterfactual explanations to measure distance to decision boundaries, improving scalability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety of machine learning systems by providing accurate and explainable OOD detection.

Method: Leverages counterfactual explanations to calculate decision boundary distances, with strategies to improve scalability in embedding space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 (93.50% AUROC, 25.80% FPR95), CIFAR-100 (97.05% AUROC, 13.79% FPR95), and ImageNet-200 (92.55% AUROC, 33.55% FPR95).

Conclusion: The method effectively detects OOD data while providing interpretable results through counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95
across four OOD datasets

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the EM algorithm's behavior in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR), showing convergence rates vary with initial mixing weights and connecting population-level and finite-sample results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the EM algorithm's performance under model misspecification in 2MLR, particularly how initial mixing weights affect convergence and statistical accuracy.

Method: Theoretical analysis of EM for overspecified 2MLR, including population-level (Theorem 5.1) and finite-sample (Theorem 6.1) results, with extensions to low SNR.

Result: Linear convergence for unbalanced initial weights, sublinear for balanced. Finite-sample accuracy varies with mixing weights: $O((d/n)^{1/2})$ (unbalanced) vs. $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ (balanced).

Conclusion: Initial mixing weights critically impact EM's convergence and accuracy, with clear connections between population and finite-sample behavior.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the role of benchmarks in improving reasoning language models, showing that impactful benchmarks can act as curricula for learning, not just evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning language models generalize better through intermediate steps and the role of benchmarks in their performance.

Method: Analyzed the effects of benchmark-driven selection on reasoning models, using DeepSeek-R1 and a sequential decision-making problem.

Result: Better performance is often due to impactful benchmarks acting as learning curricula, not just model size or algorithmic improvements.

Conclusion: Benchmarks can serve as training curricula, making task novelty crucial for measuring generalization in reasoning models.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven approach using explainable ML to monitor dairy cattle health and behavior, leveraging IoT sensors and 4G networks for real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dairy farmers struggle with tracking cattle health and optimizing yield; this work aims to provide actionable insights using modern ML methods.

Method: Uses 3-axis accelerometer data, Bluetooth IoT devices, and 4G networks. Pre-processes data with statistical and signal techniques, evaluates hyperparameter-optimized ML models (e.g., k-nearest neighbor).

Result: k-nearest neighbor achieved high performance (AUC ~0.99). SHAP framework provided interpretable feature importance.

Conclusion: The approach offers a transparent, practical ML solution for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-driven analysis of handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks provides a scalable, low-cost forensic tool to link ivory shipments and disrupt trafficking networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transnational ivory trade drives elephant population declines, but existing forensic methods like DNA analysis are costly or unavailable. Handwritten markings on tusks, though easy to photograph, are underutilized.

Method: An AI pipeline was developed to extract and analyze handwritten markings from 6,085 photographs of seized ivory (2014-2019). Object detection and AI tools identified 17,000+ markings, including 184 recurring 'signature markings.'

Result: 20 signature markings linked multiple seizures, connecting traffickers involved in different shipments. This method complements DNA analysis where genetic data is unavailable.

Conclusion: AI-driven handwriting analysis offers a transformative, scalable tool for wildlife forensics, aiding efforts to disrupt organized ivory trafficking.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study compares D-Wave quantum annealer and Gibbs sampling for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), finding limited overlap in local minima discovery but potential for combined approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of sampling from RBMs using a local-valley approach and evaluate the performance of D-Wave quantum annealers compared to classical Gibbs sampling.

Method: Applied a local-valley (LV) centered approach to compare D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM under contrastive-divergence-based learning conditions.

Result: D-Wave samples belonged to more LVs than Gibbs, but many LVs differed. Overlap was less favorable for high-probability states, but some important minima were unique to each method.

Conclusion: D-Wave's limited improvement explains past failures, but combining classical and quantum methods may offer potential.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable machine learning model (LightGBM) was developed for early AKI prediction in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AKI in cirrhosis patients worsens outcomes, but existing predictive tools lack accuracy and interpretability. This study aimed to improve early detection.

Method: Retrospective analysis of MIMIC-IV data, preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of six ML algorithms using clinical variables from the first 48 ICU hours.

Result: LightGBM performed best (AUROC 0.808, accuracy 0.704, NPV 0.911), identifying key predictors like prolonged PTT and low pH.

Conclusion: The model enables accurate early AKI risk stratification, supports clinical decision-making, and warrants further validation and EHR integration.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for cryptographic function learning, specifically mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers, to evaluate transformer models' generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend ICL beyond simple function classes to structured cryptographic tasks, assessing transformers' ability to infer hidden mappings from limited examples.

Method: Uses ICL with transformer models to learn ciphers from (cipher text, plain text) pairs without parameter updates, focusing on substitution and Vigenère ciphers.

Result: Demonstrates transformers' capability to infer and generalize cryptographic mappings under the ICL paradigm.

Conclusion: ICL can effectively tackle structured cryptographic tasks, highlighting transformers' strong inductive biases and generalization potential.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HPMI is a retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers, using head-wise pruning and malicious injection, achieving high attack success and bypassing defenses without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and existing methods are resource-intensive or intrusive. HPMI aims to provide a lightweight, non-intrusive solution.

Method: HPMI prunes the least important head and injects a pre-trained malicious head, requiring minimal data and no retraining.

Result: HPMI achieves 99.55% attack success, negligible clean accuracy loss, and bypasses four advanced defenses.

Conclusion: HPMI is a highly effective, concealable, and robust backdoor attack method for transformers, outperforming retraining-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Conclusion: The operators effectively approximate functions, with demonstrated convergence properties in various settings.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating

uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling complexity in cloud-native database systems.

Method: Introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism and a reward-shaping mechanism to integrate local and global feedback.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy convergence speed, system stability, and fairness.

Conclusion: The method is effective for large-scale scheduling environments with high concurrency and complex dependencies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Motivation: Address challenges like data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and centralized modeling limitations in multi-tenant cloud environments.

Method: Federated training framework with local model training by tenants, parameter aggregation for a global model, personalized parameter adjustment, and Mahalanobis distance for anomaly scoring.

Result: Outperforms existing models in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score; maintains robustness under varying participation rates and noise levels.

Conclusion: The method is practical for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing, balancing privacy and performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical

TL;DR: Proposes a method for adapting to source component shifts in data streams by combining offline decomposition and online mixing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively utilize recurring shifts or capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation.

Method: Offline decomposition using the EM algorithm to learn source components, followed by online mixing weight adaptation via convex optimization.

Result: Reduces cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% on real-world regression datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages shift characteristics, achieving superior adaptation performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for Parkinson's Disease medication management provides reliable, uncertainty-quantified predictions for levodopa dosing adjustments, improving clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's Disease medication management lacks systematic predictive methods, relying on trial-and-error, which risks inadequate symptom control or side effects due to unquantified uncertainty.

Method: A two-stage conformal prediction framework uses electronic health records to predict medication needs and levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments, addressing zero-inflation in PD data.

Result: The framework achieved reliable prediction intervals with marginal coverage, offering precise short-term and wider long-term forecasts for medication adjustments.

Conclusion: Quantifying uncertainty in predictions enables evidence-based levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control and quality of life while minimizing side effects.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic methods fail to model biological variability while maintaining functional consistency in visual-to-neural mapping.

Method: SynBrain uses BrainVAE for probabilistic neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for high-fidelity fMRI synthesis.

Result: SynBrain excels in subject-specific encoding, adapts to new subjects with few-shot data, and improves fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain captures functional consistency and biological variability, offering interpretable and high-quality fMRI synthesis.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

*Danni Peng,Yuan Wang,Kangning Cai,Peiyan Ning,Jiming Xu,Yong Liu,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Qingsong Wei,Huazhu Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedKEI is a federated learning framework that uses knowledge transfer from past tasks to initialize adapters for new tasks, improving adaptation in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quick adaptation to new healthcare tasks while preserving privacy and leveraging past knowledge.

Method: Uses global clustering and bi-level optimization to personalize knowledge transfer via inter- and intra-cluster weights.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new diseases across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively enhances federated learning for healthcare by leveraging past knowledge for faster and better adaptation.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLIP-Fed is a FL backdoor defense framework using vision-language models to address heterogeneous data and privacy concerns, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL backdoor defenses assume homogeneous data or require clean server datasets, limiting practicality. CLIP-Fed tackles heterogeneous data and privacy issues.

Method: CLIP-Fed integrates pre- and post-aggregation defenses, uses multimodal models for dataset augmentation, and aligns global model knowledge with CLIP via prototype contrastive loss and KL divergence.

Result: CLIP-Fed reduces ASR by 2.03% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving MA by 7.92% and 0.48%, respectively.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively defends against backdoor attacks in FL under heterogeneous data, enhancing model performance and privacy.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

*Claire Jie Zhang,Seyed A. Esmaeili,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional fair clustering methods, proposing welfare-centric clustering with group utilities based on distance and representation, introducing two objectives (Rawlsian and Utilitarian) and novel algorithms with empirical success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fair clustering may yield undesirable outcomes; the paper advocates for a welfare-centric approach to model group utilities more effectively.

Method: Model group utilities using distances and proportional representation, formalize Rawlsian and Utilitarian objectives, and introduce novel algorithms with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the methods outperform existing fair clustering baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Welfare-centric clustering with group utilities offers superior outcomes compared to traditional fairness notions, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-level IDS framework for IoMT detects zero-day attacks and distinguishes threats with high accuracy, addressing vulnerabilities in resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoMT's vulnerability to cyberattacks and unsuitability of centralized IDSs due to delays and privacy risks necessitate a decentralized, efficient solution.

Method: Proposes a multi-level IDS framework using meta-learning and OCC (usfAD algorithm) for coarse filtering, followed by detailed attack identification at Edge and Cloud layers.

Result: Achieves 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score on the CICIoMT2024 dataset, with high zero-day attack detection.

Conclusion: The framework ensures robust security for IoMT, balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

TL;DR: The paper explores distribution learning in semantic communication, establishing conditions for learning source statistics with unknown priors, and reveals a trade-off between immediate performance and long-term learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inferring underlying meaning distributions in semantic communication, especially when priors are unknown, and to understand the trade-offs in system design.

Method: The study proves learnability conditions (full rank of the transmission matrix), characterizes convergence rates, and quantifies semantic distortion from estimation errors. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate the framework.

Result: Learnability requires full-rank transmission matrices, and encoding schemes optimized for immediate performance may hinder long-term learnability. Experiments confirm the impact of system conditioning.

Conclusion: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of statistical learning in semantic communication, offering design principles for balancing performance and adaptation.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eMamba is a hardware acceleration framework for Mamba models on edge devices, improving efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lack of optimized hardware acceleration frameworks for deploying Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: eMamba replaces complex layers with lightweight alternatives, approximates expensive operations, and uses approximation-aware NAS.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy with fewer parameters, lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced resource usage.

Conclusion: eMamba is a viable solution for efficient deployment of Mamba models on edge platforms.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### [243] [A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393)
*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified evaluation framework for Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) in multi-annotator settings, proposing two new metrics (DIC and BAE) to assess model performance in capturing annotator tendencies and providing behavioral explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ITL methods lack a standardized evaluation framework to verify if they truly capture annotator-specific tendencies and offer meaningful behavioral explanations.

Method: The authors propose two novel metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE), using ground-truth and predicted similarity structures for evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in evaluating ITL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework fills a critical gap in ITL evaluation, enabling better assessment of annotator tendency modeling and explanation quality.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

### [244] [XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10395)
*Aditya Tomar,Coleman Hooper,Minjae Lee,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Wonjun Kang,Luca Manolache,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XQuant reduces LLM inference memory usage by quantizing layer input activations, achieving up to 10x memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is hindered by high memory demands and bandwidth limitations, exacerbated by hardware trends favoring compute over memory.

Method: XQuant quantizes and caches layer input activations (X) instead of KV caching, rematerializing Keys and Values on-the-fly. XQuant-CL further exploits cross-layer similarity for extreme compression.

Result: XQuant achieves up to 7.7x memory savings with <0.1 perplexity degradation; XQuant-CL attains 10x savings with 0.01 degradation and 12.5x with 0.1 degradation.

Conclusion: XQuant leverages hardware compute trends to overcome memory bottlenecks, outperforming KV cache quantization while maintaining near-FP16 accuracy.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

TL;DR: SC2Arena is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in StarCraft II, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by supporting all playable races and action spaces. StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework, enhances strategic planning and tactical execution with self-correction and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in StarCraft II lack full game complexity, limiting AI's strategic planning and adaptation capabilities.

Method: SC2Arena benchmark includes all playable races and action spaces, optimized for spatial reasoning. StarEvolve uses a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure and a scoring system for high-quality data fine-tuning.

Result: StarEvolve outperforms in strategic planning, and SC2Arena provides insights for developing generalist agents.

Conclusion: The combination of SC2Arena and StarEvolve advances AI's ability in complex decision-making, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM improves generalization in overparameterized models. This work analyzes SAM's norm dynamics in tensorized models, introduces Norm Deviation, and proposes Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS) for better performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand SAM's behavior in tensorized or scale-invariant models, which is underexplored, and improve its regularization effects.

Method: Leverage scale-invariance to analyze norm dynamics, introduce Norm Deviation, and propose DAS to mimic SAM's regularization.

Result: DAS achieves competitive or improved performance over SAM with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: DAS effectively mimics SAM's regularization and offers practical advantages in various tasks.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC is a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations by preserving inter-feature dependencies and accommodating user constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods lack realism, generalizability, and user-centric flexibility, often ignoring complex data dependencies and user preferences.

Method: RealAC aligns joint distributions of feature pairs to preserve dependencies and allows users to freeze attributes, ensuring feasibility and realism.

Result: RealAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realism, actionability, and dependency preservation across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: RealAC provides a causality-aware, user-centric solution for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates per-node explanations during prediction, maintaining accuracy while enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs lack interpretability in high-stakes applications; existing explainability methods are post-hoc and global, failing to provide local insights.

Method: X-Node constructs structured context vectors for each node, uses a Reasoner module to generate explanations, and integrates them back into the GNN via text-injection.

Result: X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy on MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST datasets while providing faithful per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node advances GNN interpretability by embedding explanations directly into the prediction process, balancing accuracy and transparency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG addresses class imbalance in Federated Graph Learning (FGL) by using a hierarchical GAN for federated generative data augmentation, improving minority-class feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in FGL biases models toward majority classes, worsened by biased neighborhood information for minority nodes.

Method: Proposes GraphFedMIG, a framework with local generators and clustered discriminators, guided by mutual information to enhance minority-class features.

Result: Outperforms baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG effectively mitigates class imbalance in FGL by leveraging generative data augmentation and mutual information guidance.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that eliminates calibration by combining population-level pretraining and continual online finetuning, improving accuracy and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs suffer from accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift and user variability, requiring frequent recalibration, which limits deployment.

Method: EDAPT trains a baseline decoder using multi-user data, then continually personalizes it via supervised finetuning as neural patterns evolve. It also uses unsupervised domain adaptation for further gains.

Result: EDAPT consistently outperforms static methods across nine datasets, with efficient updates (200ms on consumer hardware). Accuracy scales with total data, not its allocation.

Conclusion: EDAPT offers a practical, calibration-free solution for BCIs, reducing deployment barriers.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how unobserved confounding, typically a problem in observational studies, can also affect recommender systems due to common practices like feature engineering and A/B testing, and offers solutions to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of confounding in recommender systems caused by standard practices, which can bias results and reduce performance.

Method: The paper uses simulation studies to illustrate how practices like feature engineering and A/B testing introduce confounding and provides practical suggestions to mitigate it.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrate that common practices can introduce confounding, negatively impacting recommender system performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should be aware of and address confounding in recommender systems by adopting the suggested mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using JEPAs and neural ODEs to create structured latent state-space models from observation data, demonstrated with a pendulum system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon reconstruction-based methods by leveraging JEPAs for more capable world models.

Method: Integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs, enforcing contractive embeddings and Lipschitz constants for organized latent spaces.

Result: Successfully generates structured latent state-space models for a pendulum system using only image data.

Conclusion: The technique offers a new approach for general control algorithms and robotics applications.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

*Amir Mehrpanah,Matteo Gamba,Kevin Smith,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral framework is introduced to analyze and quantify the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in explanations of ReLU networks, addressing noisy gradient-based interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks' reliance on individual pixels for predictions leads to noisy and hard-to-interpret gradient-based explanations, while existing smoothing methods compromise faithfulness.

Method: A unifying spectral framework is proposed to analyze smoothness and faithfulness, regularizing high-frequency contributions of ReLU networks to balance these factors.

Result: The framework identifies an "explanation gap" caused by surrogate-based smoothing and validates findings across datasets and design choices.

Conclusion: The study provides a principled approach to understanding and managing the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in network explanations.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces automated codebook learning models for multiclass classification using ECOC, outperforming traditional methods in robustness to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECOC methods use manual or random codebooks, which are inefficient and may not adapt well to specific datasets.

Method: Three contrastive learning-based models are proposed to learn codebooks adaptively from data.

Result: The models show superior robustness to adversarial attacks on four datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Automated codebook learning with ECOC is more effective and adaptable than traditional methods.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework unifying multimodal understanding and generation via decoupled Cognition and Deliberation phases, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of integrating autoregressive LLMs for reasoning and diffusion models for generation in multimodal applications.

Method: MAGUS uses symbolic multi-agent collaboration in two phases: Cognition (structured understanding/planning) and Deliberation (LLM reasoning + diffusion generation).

Result: Outperforms baselines and GPT-4o on benchmarks like MME for image, video, audio generation, and cross-modal tasks.

Conclusion: MAGUS offers flexible, scalable any-to-any multimodal capabilities without joint training, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enhance Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms for optimizing combinatorial problems, outperforming traditional MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCMC methods struggle with hard combinatorial problems due to homogeneous temperature profiles, leading to inefficiency in escaping suboptimal solutions.

Method: Deep RL is used to train nonlocal transition policies in NMC, leveraging energy changes and landscape geometry as rewards and states.

Result: The RL-trained NMC outperforms standard MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing in solving hard 4-SAT problems, achieving better energy, speed, and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Deep RL can effectively enhance NMC algorithms, offering improved performance for complex combinatorial optimization challenges.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCD is a test-time framework for joint generation using coupled diffusion models, enforcing constraints without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while enforcing task-specific constraints without costly retraining.

Method: Introduces a coupled guidance term and a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce constraints.

Result: Effective in image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning, with improved coupling and constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: PCD offers a practical solution for constrained joint generation without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

TL;DR: Applm, a framework using the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, outperforms existing methods in identifying allergens, including novel ones and those with high sequence similarity, and assesses mutation impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Allergens pose a public health challenge, and accurate identification is needed to address this issue.

Method: Applm leverages the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM model for allergen prediction, tested in diverse real-world scenarios.

Result: Applm consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in tasks like identifying novel allergens and differentiating among homologs.

Conclusion: xTrimoPGLM's general protein sequence understanding is key to Applm's success; the framework and datasets are open-source for future research.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA) to address reward sparsity and misalignment in long-horizon RL, particularly for software engineering tasks, improving completion and modification rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward shaping methods struggle with bias or misalignment in long-horizon RL, especially in software engineering tasks requiring multi-turn reasoning and verification.

Method: Proposes the SWE-oriented RL Framework and G-RA, which accumulates immediate rewards only when long-term rewards meet a threshold, ensuring stable optimization.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in completion rates (47.6% to 93.8%) and modification rates (19.6% to 23.8%) on SWE-bench Verified and kBench.

Conclusion: G-RA effectively balances reward accumulation, avoiding policy degradation and providing a practical solution for long-horizon RL challenges.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

TL;DR: CATE-B is an open-source co-pilot system using LLMs to simplify treatment effect estimation by guiding users through causal modeling, adjustment selection, and method choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of causal inference methods limits their adoption, despite their importance in fields like healthcare and economics.

Method: CATE-B employs LLMs for causal discovery, adjustment set identification, and regression method selection.

Result: The system provides a user-friendly approach to TE estimation and includes benchmark tasks for evaluation.

Conclusion: CATE-B reduces barriers to causal analysis and sets a foundation for automated TE benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: Proposes unified learning, a method to train heterogeneous deep learning models (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) coherently across datasets using a shared graph learning space, improving generalizability under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of maintaining model generalizability in medical imaging under domain shifts caused by varying techniques, protocols, and data types across hospitals.

Method: Encodes each model into a graph representation, unifies them in a shared graph learning space, and optimizes using a unified GNN (uGNN) for parameter sharing and knowledge transfer.

Result: Boosts performance on mixed-distribution tests, showing robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts, as validated on MorphoMNIST and MedMNIST benchmarks.

Conclusion: Unified learning effectively enhances generalizability across heterogeneous models and datasets, offering a scalable solution for domain shifts in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) for upsampling energy time series, reducing RMSE by 9% and improving MPC accuracy by 13%, without needing high-resolution ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional upsampling methods (information loss, noise) and advanced models (supervised learning paradox, insufficient context) in energy network design.

Method: Proposes GATs, a method trained without high-resolution ground-truth data, leveraging adversarial learning and transformers.

Result: Reduces RMSE by 9% and improves MPC accuracy by 13% compared to conventional interpolation.

Conclusion: GATs offer a promising solution for upsampling in energy systems, overcoming key challenges of existing methods.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

TL;DR: FreeGAD is a training-free graph anomaly detection method that outperforms existing deep learning-based approaches in performance, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based GAD methods are costly and poorly scalable due to complex training. Empirical findings show training may not significantly boost performance.

Method: FreeGAD uses an affinity-gated residual encoder for anomaly-aware representations and anchor nodes for pseudo-normal/anomalous guidance, calculating scores via statistical deviations.

Result: FreeGAD achieves superior performance, efficiency, and scalability across multiple benchmark datasets without training or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: Training-free methods like FreeGAD can effectively address GAD challenges, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to resource-intensive deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability issues in deep network explanations by providing a formal analysis.

Method: Adopts probabilistic and spectral perspectives to analyze explanation methods, identifies spectral bias, and proposes remedies like a standard perturbation scale and SpectralLens.

Result: Reveals spectral bias in gradient-based methods and validates solutions through quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The study formalizes explanation reliability, offering practical solutions for consistent deep network interpretations.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses sample inefficiency in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) by using variance-reduction techniques to improve policy gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MORL optimizes multiple conflicting objectives, but existing policy gradient methods suffer from high sample inefficiency and strict assumptions.

Method: The authors implement variance-reduction techniques to reduce sample complexity while maintaining scalability.

Result: The proposed method improves sample efficiency without relying on overly strict assumptions.

Conclusion: Variance-reduction techniques effectively enhance MORL policy gradients, balancing trade-offs and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy

*Lucas Cardoso,Vitor Santos,José Ribeiro Filho,Ricardo Prudêncio,Regiane Kawasaki,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) to improve dataset partitioning for ML model validation, revealing instance heterogeneity and improving model performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data partitioning ignores instance quality, leading to suboptimal model validation. IRT can address this by characterizing instance heterogeneity.

Method: IRT parameters are used to partition datasets, evaluating their impact on ML model performance across four tabular datasets.

Result: IRT reveals instance heterogeneity and identifies informative subgroups. Balanced partitions improve bias-variance tradeoff understanding. High-guessing instances harm model performance.

Conclusion: IRT-informed partitioning enhances ML model validation by highlighting instance quality and improving performance analysis.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

*Patrick Soga,Zhenyu Lei,Yinhan He,Camille Bilodeau,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for predicting binding free energy changes (ΔΔG) in protein engineering by decomposing ΔΔG into sequence-based and structure-based components, outperforming existing deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting ΔΔG is crucial for protein and PPI engineering in drug discovery, but estimating full conformational distributions is intractable. This work aims to simplify the process by leveraging energy-based models.

Method: Decomposes ΔΔG into sequence-based (inverse folding model) and structure-based (energy model) components, assuming equilibrium between bound and unbound states. Introduces a ΔΔE term grounded in statistical mechanics.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art deep learning methods in ΔΔG prediction and SARS-CoV-2 antibody optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a tractable and accurate approach to ΔΔG prediction, combining physical inductive bias with deep learning for improved performance in protein engineering.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

*Yihua Wang,Qi Jia,Cong Xu,Feiyu Chen,Yuhan Liu,Haotian Zhang,Liang Jin,Lu Liu,Zhichun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses shortcut learning in multimodal sarcasm detection, introduces MUStARD++$^{R}$ to remove shortcuts, and proposes MCIB for effective fusion, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut learning in datasets impairs model generalization, and current modality fusion strategies are ineffective for sarcasm detection.

Method: Constructs MUStARD++$^{R}$ to eliminate shortcuts and introduces the MCIB model for efficient multimodal fusion.

Result: MCIB outperforms others without relying on shortcut learning.

Conclusion: Effective modality fusion is crucial for sarcasm detection, and MCIB provides a robust solution.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHENIC improves spatial transcriptomics clustering by integrating topological features and optimizing spatial embeddings, outperforming existing methods by 3.31%-6.54%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial transcriptomics clustering are limited by noisy data and poor spatial neighborhood modeling.

Method: SPHENIC uses persistent homology for stable representation learning and a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM) to refine spatial embeddings.

Result: SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% on 14 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPHENIC effectively addresses limitations in spatial clustering by leveraging topological and spatial optimization, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

### [272] [Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10649)
*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Generative AI (GenAI) for forecasting land-use and land-cover change (LULC), addressing a gap in Earth system modeling. A diffusion model is trained for decadal imperviousness forecasting, outperforming a no-change baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth system models lack accurate LULC forecasting, which is critical for assessing risks and consequences in future climate scenarios.

Method: The study frames LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem using Generative AI, specifically a diffusion model, trained on historical data for imperviousness forecasting.

Result: The diffusion model achieves lower MAE than a no-change baseline for resolutions ≥ 0.7×0.7 km² across 12 metropolitan areas, demonstrating its ability to capture spatiotemporal patterns.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for LULC forecasting, with future research aimed at incorporating Earth's physical properties and scenario simulation via driver variables.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph classification by leveraging tabular data methods and exploring expressive Weisfeiler-Leman variants.

Method: Tabularize graph data using Weisfeiler-Leman variants, test on benchmarks, and compare with graph neural networks and kernels.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art accuracy with improved time/memory efficiency; interpretable modal logic formulas are also discussed.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and efficient for graph classification, with potential for interpretability.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDNS, a neural sampler for generating samples from discrete state spaces with known target distributions, addressing challenges like large cardinality and multi-modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning efficient neural samplers for complex discrete distributions is crucial in fields like statistical physics and machine learning, especially when traditional methods struggle with high dimensions and multi-modality.

Method: MDNS aligns path measures using learning objectives grounded in stochastic optimal control of continuous-time Markov chains.

Result: MDNS outperforms other baselines in accuracy and scalability across various high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions.

Conclusion: MDNS is a robust and scalable framework for discrete neural sampling, validated by extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFN is a framework using RL-trained LLMs to autonomously generate network filters for preventing 1-day or n-day exploits, addressing scalability, compatibility, and robustness issues in existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like host-based patching and network filtering are inadequate due to scalability, compatibility, and deployment challenges.

Method: REFN employs RL-driven LLMs, online network rewards, and edge security gateways for unified deployment and validation.

Result: REFN achieves 21.1% higher accuracy, a Mean Time To Patch of 3.65 hours, and scales to 10K devices.

Conclusion: REFN is a promising step toward using LLMs for rapid, large-scale exploit prevention.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GPU-powered antenna simulation framework is proposed for machine learning applications, outperforming CPUs and matching commercial EM software results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in antenna design requires large datasets, but EM simulations are computationally intensive. GPUs address this challenge.

Method: Uses GPU-based open-source EM software (gprMax) to generate large antenna datasets, comparing performance with commercial software and evaluating ML models.

Result: Entry-level GPUs outperform high-end CPUs, with gaming GPUs achieving 18x speed. Open-source software matches commercial results for microstrip antennas.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration enables efficient large-scale antenna simulations for ML, with open-source tools providing viable alternatives to commercial software.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach using dual-stream least squares to address non-IID data challenges in PFL, achieving better accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with non-IID data, hindering generalization and personalization. The paper aims to solve this issue.

Method: APFL uses a frozen backbone for feature extraction and dual-stream analytic models (shared primary stream for global generalization and refinement stream for local personalization).

Result: APFL achieves heterogeneity invariance and outperforms baselines by 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Conclusion: APFL effectively addresses non-IID data challenges in PFL, offering superior performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: RLVR faces challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation. Using Pass@k as a reward improves exploration, and analytical solutions show mutual enhancement between exploration and exploitation. Advantage design for RLVR is promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of conservative policies in RLVR by exploring the role of Pass@k as a reward metric and its impact on exploration.

Method: Train policy models using Pass@k as the reward (Pass@k Training) and derive an analytical solution for its advantage.

Result: Pass@k Training enhances exploration, and exploration/exploitation can mutually benefit each other. Advantage design shows promising results.

Conclusion: Pass@k Training and advantage design offer a potential direction for improving RLVR by balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: Erwin NSA effectively addresses quadratic attention complexity, enhancing transformer efficiency for large physical systems.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems

TL;DR: IBEX, a coarse-to-fine pipeline, improves structure-based drug design by addressing data scarcity and overfitting, achieving better docking success rates and molecular properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of publicly available protein-ligand complexes limits the effectiveness of 3D generative models in drug discovery, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.

Method: IBEX uses PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to analyze sample information density, employs Scaffold Hopping for better transfer, and refines conformations with L-BFGS optimization.

Result: IBEX increases docking success from 53% to 64%, improves Vina scores, achieves better validity and diversity, and reduces extrapolation error.

Conclusion: IBEX effectively addresses data scarcity in drug design, outperforming existing methods in key metrics.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GNN-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) is underexplored, and existing methods focus on node classification, not autoencoder-based GAD.

Method: Proposes DECAF-GAD with a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes and a specialized autoencoder with fairness-guided loss.

Result: Achieves competitive GAD performance while significantly improving fairness metrics on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD effectively balances fairness and performance in GAD, addressing biases in autoencoder-based models.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RMAB algorithms assume stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), but real-world applications like healthcare and recommendation systems often exhibit non-stationary dynamics, necessitating new solutions.

Method: The \rmab\ algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to learn and adapt to non-stationary transition dynamics.

Result: The algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$, providing a theoretical foundation for non-stationary RMAB problems.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel approach for non-stationary RMABs, offering both practical and theoretical advancements for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Motivation: GPs are limited by computational complexity in streaming scenarios, necessitating efficient reduction methods for large datasets.

Method: Unified comparison of reduction criteria, analyzing computational complexity and behavior, tested on benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Result: Evaluation provides insights into criteria performance, with proposed acceptance criteria for redundancy filtering.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are offered for selecting reduction criteria in Online GP algorithms.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

*Parsa Omidi,Xingshuai Huang,Axel Laborieux,Bahareh Nikpour,Tianyu Shi,Armaghan Eshaghi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A review bridging neuroscience and AI to enhance Transformers with adaptive memory systems for lifelong learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Transformers in long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration by leveraging neuroscience principles.

Method: Unified framework combining dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and consolidation with Memory-Augmented Transformers, analyzed through functional objectives, memory representations, and integration mechanisms.

Result: Identifies a shift toward adaptive memory systems and highlights solutions like hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates.

Conclusion: Provides a roadmap for developing cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures, addressing scalability and interference challenges.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

*Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Kimberly Mai,Prakhar Ganesh,Martin Vechev,Ferdinando Fioretto,Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to unify fragmented research and aid practitioners in applying data minimization principles effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data minimization is a key principle in data protection regulations like GDPR, but its application in ML is fragmented, causing confusion among practitioners.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive DMML framework, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and minimization points, and systematically review related literature.

Result: The framework provides a structured overview of DMML and DM-adjacent methodologies, enabling better understanding and adoption of data minimization in AI/ML.

Conclusion: The work bridges gaps in DMML research, offering a unified approach to help practitioners and researchers implement data minimization effectively.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

### [286] [Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10866)
*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive verification protocol for data attribution in ML models, ensuring trust and efficiency for resource-constrained parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trust issue in data attribution methods, which are computationally expensive and often accessible only to resource-rich parties, by enabling verification for resource-constrained users.

Method: An interactive proof protocol between a Prover (computationally powerful) and a Verifier (resource-constrained) to verify data attributions, with formal guarantees of completeness, soundness, and efficiency.

Result: The protocol ensures Verifier accepts attributions close to optimal (PAC verification) with minimal workload (O(1/ε) retrainings), even if the Prover deviates.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable and trustworthy solution for verifying data attributions, applicable to various attribution tasks.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

*Haydn Thomas Jones,Natalie Maus,Josh Magnus Ludan,Maggie Ziyu Huan,Jiaming Liang,Marcelo Der Torossian Torres,Jiatao Liang,Zachary Ives,Yoseph Barash,Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez,Jacob R. Gardner,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (\ourdataset) of priors for AI-driven therapeutic design, extracted from literature using LLM pipelines. It improves model performance and safety in molecule design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven discovery lacks experimental priors, leading to unsafe molecule proposals. The dataset aims to provide reliable priors for safer and more effective designs.

Method: The dataset is constructed using LLM pipelines to extract and summarize therapeutic entities from literature. Models (LLM, CLIP, LLava) are trained on this data for joint reasoning on text and design targets.

Result: Models pretrained with \ourdataset outperform larger models on TDC tasks and produce safer molecule proposals in GuacaMol.

Conclusion: \ourdataset enhances AI-driven therapeutic design by providing strong priors, improving safety and effectiveness. The dataset is publicly available and will expand with new literature.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

*Jozef Skakala*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Using neural networks (NNs) trained on model simulations to estimate carbon pools in shelf seas, offering a cost-effective alternative to reanalyses and providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and uncertain in situ or satellite data for carbon pools in shelf seas necessitate alternative methods like reanalyses, which are expensive.

Method: An ensemble of NNs learns relationships between observable variables and carbon pools from a physics-biogeochemistry model, applied to the North-West European Shelf (NWES) reanalysis.

Result: NNs reproduce reanalysis outputs for carbon pools and provide uncertainty information, unlike existing reanalyses.

Conclusion: Model-informed machine learning is a viable, cost-effective alternative to reanalyses and can complement sparse or uncertain observational data.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific jargon hinders interdisciplinary communication, and current jargon-management strategies are inadequate.

Method: Conducted a diary study with 16 professionals, designed ParseJargon, and tested it in controlled and field studies.

Result: Personalized jargon support improved comprehension and engagement, while general-purpose support had negative effects.

Conclusion: ParseJargon demonstrates practical value for interdisciplinary communication, with broader applications in education and workplaces.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for longitudinal studies in UIST research due to evolving user-AI interactions and proposes a workshop to address challenges in conducting such studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User interactions with AI change over time, making one-time evaluations inadequate. Longitudinal studies are needed but face deployment, evaluation, and data collection challenges.

Method: The workshop includes a keynote, panel discussions, breakout groups, and hands-on sessions for protocol design and tool prototyping.

Result: The workshop aims to build a community and promote longitudinal research as a standard method for UIST tools.

Conclusion: Longitudinal studies are essential for UIST research, and the workshop provides practical strategies to overcome implementation challenges.

Abstract: UIST researchers develop tools to address user challenges. However, user
interactions with AI evolve over time through learning, adaptation, and
repurposing, making one time evaluations insufficient. Capturing these dynamics
requires longer-term studies, but challenges in deployment, evaluation design,
and data collection have made such longitudinal research difficult to
implement. Our workshop aims to tackle these challenges and prepare researchers
with practical strategies for longitudinal studies. The workshop includes a
keynote, panel discussions, and interactive breakout groups for discussion and
hands-on protocol design and tool prototyping sessions. We seek to foster a

Motivation: To enable patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy by leveraging pre-trained large-scale foundation models for generalized state estimation.

Method: Training a foundation model on longitudinal deep brain stimulation recordings (24+ days) with a 30-minute context window and an optimized pre-training loss function correcting for frequency bias.

Result: Successful decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, demonstrating generalization without patient-specific training.

Conclusion: The foundation model offers a scalable approach for neural decoding in neuromodulation therapy, addressing long time-scale symptom fluctuations and frequency bias.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable
patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in
pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized
state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a
foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation
recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between intuitive text prompts and precise knob/slider controls for intricate OSC tasks.

Method: Developed MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and prompt design criteria to enable parametric OSC control via natural language, demonstrated with 14 QA examples.

Result: Claude integrated with MCP2OSC effectively generates, interprets, and manages OSC messages, enhancing human-machine collaboration.

Conclusion: MCP2OSC offers a novel LLM-based approach for OSC control, suggesting potential as a universal mechanism for multimedia devices.

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly

TL;DR: The study identifies reproducible physiological features linked to arousal levels, emphasizing rigorous reproducibility in Affective Computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility issues in linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers.

Method: Analyzed 164 features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals using the T-Rex method for feature selection.

Result: Only two electrodermal-derived features showed reproducible and significant associations with arousal.

Conclusion: Rigorous reproducibility assessments are crucial for reliable physiological feature selection in Affective Computing.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

TL;DR: Saracoder improves repository-level code completion by refining retrieval results with hierarchical feature optimization and resolving symbol ambiguity, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion rely on superficial text similarity, causing semantic misguidance, redundancy, and unresolved symbol ambiguity.

Method: Saracoder uses Hierarchical Feature Optimization (semantic distillation, duplicate pruning, graph-based structural similarity) and an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator for dependency analysis.

Result: Saracoder outperforms baselines on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks across languages and models.

Conclusion: Systematic refinement of retrieval results offers a new paradigm for accurate and robust repository-level code completion.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next Edit Prediction, a task to predict developers' next code edits by analyzing interaction history, aiming to improve AI-powered coding assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI coding assistants either offer low-latency code completion (limited to cursor position) or chat-based editing (requires context-switching), both of which are suboptimal for seamless developer collaboration.

Method: The authors curate a dataset and benchmark for Next Edit Prediction, fine-tune models, and evaluate them against baselines.

Result: The study yields novel findings, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting edits proactively.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for a new interaction paradigm where AI assistants anticipate developer actions instead of reacting to explicit instructions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest
discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.

proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.
Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds
Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data

the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized downstream task performance despite limited client data and heterogeneous distributions, while accommodating varying computational resources.

Method: FlexP-SFL combines split learning with personalized federated learning, enabling clients to train locally based on resource constraints and using an alignment strategy for global data performance.

Result: FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in both fine-tuning efficiency and final accuracy.

Conclusion: FlexP-SFL is an effective solution for personalized federated learning under resource and data constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models is critical for superior performance on
personalized downstream tasks, compared to using pre-trained models.
Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning,
but limited client data and heterogeneous data distributions hinder effective
collaboration. To address the challenge, we propose a flexible personalized
federated learning paradigm that enables clients to engage in collaborative
learning while maintaining personalized objectives. Given the limited and
heterogeneous computational resources available on clients, we introduce
\textbf{flexible personalized split federated learning (FlexP-SFL)}. Based on
split learning, FlexP-SFL allows each client to train a portion of the model
locally while offloading the rest to a server, according to resource
constraints. Additionally, we propose an alignment strategy to improve
personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that
FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency
and final accuracy.

### [300] [Virtual Sensing for Solder Layer Degradation and Temperature Monitoring in IGBT Modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10515)
*Andrea Urgolo,Monika Stipsitz,Helios Sanchis-Alepuz*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Machine learning-based virtual sensing accurately estimates IGBT module degradation and temperature maps using limited physical sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliability of IGBT modules in power systems is critical, but direct measurement of degradation indicators is challenging due to physical constraints.

Method: Uses synthetic data and machine learning to estimate solder layer degradation and temperature maps from limited sensor inputs.

Result: Achieves 1.17% mean absolute error in degraded solder area estimation and 4.56% maximum relative error in temperature reproduction.

Conclusion: Machine learning virtual sensing is feasible for accurate IGBT degradation monitoring, offering a practical alternative to direct measurements.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

TL;DR: DeepCSI, a physics-informed deep learning framework, enhances inverse scattering problem solving by combining contrast source inversion and neural operators for fast, accurate medium reconstruction across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the nonlinearity and computational challenges of inverse scattering problems in electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics.

Method: Uses a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) to model current distributions, linearizing the problem. Employs a hybrid loss function for joint optimization of network and medium parameters.

Result: Achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under full-data, phaseless, and multi-frequency conditions, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: DeepCSI provides an efficient, universal solution for complex inverse scattering problems, simplifying and improving accuracy in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under
full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming
traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for
complex inverse scattering problems.

### [302] [A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017)
*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) for healthcare, addressing privacy-utility trade-offs and class imbalance. It proposes a hybrid SMOTETomek method and optimized FedProx to achieve high utility (recall >77%) with strong privacy (epsilon 9.0).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative health research while protecting patient privacy, addressing challenges like data imbalance and privacy-utility trade-offs in FL with DP.

Method: Implemented an FL framework for cardiovascular risk prediction, integrating SMOTETomek for imbalance and tuned FedProx for non-IID data.

Result: Achieved high clinical utility (recall >77%) with strong privacy (epsilon 9.0), outperforming standard FedAvg.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for secure, accurate diagnostic tools in heterogeneous healthcare data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a Context Filtering model to defend against LLM jailbreak attacks, reducing attack success by up to 88% while preserving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing safety and ethical risks from jailbreak attacks exploiting adversarial context in LLMs.

Method: Input pre-processing to filter untrustworthy context and identify primary prompts, preserving LLM performance.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rates by up to 88%, maintains original LLM performance, and achieves state-of-the-art safety and helpfulness.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play Context Filtering model effectively enhances LLM safety without fine-tuning, applicable to all LLMs.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

### [304] [Cognitive Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence: Guardrail Engineering with CCS-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10033)
*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCS-7, a taxonomy of cognitive vulnerabilities in language models, and evaluates a TFVA intervention's effectiveness across models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cognitive vulnerabilities in language models that traditional alignment methods miss, inspired by human cognitive security research.

Method: Conducted a human RCT (151 participants) and 12,180 experiments on seven language model architectures using TFVA-style guardrails.

Result: TFVA improved human cognitive security by 7.9%, but model results varied: some vulnerabilities were mitigated, others worsened (up to 135% error increase).

Conclusion: Cognitive safety interventions must be architecture-specific, as effectiveness varies widely, highlighting the need for tailored testing before deployment.

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

### [305] [Certifiably robust malware detectors by design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10038)
*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection is proposed, addressing evasion through adversarial examples without altering malware functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static malware analysis relies on machine learning but is vulnerable to adversarial examples that evade detection without changing malware behavior.

Method: Proposes a model architecture for robust detection and decomposes robust detectors into a specific structure, applied in the ERDALT framework.

Result: Enables robust malware detection with limited performance reduction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach offers a certifiably robust solution for malware detection, mitigating adversarial evasion risks.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CEMA is a black-box multi-task adversarial text attack method that uses transferability and a plug-and-play substitute model to efficiently attack various tasks with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task adversarial attacks are ineffective in practical scenarios due to reliance on shared features, high query counts, and single-task limitations.

Method: CEMA employs a deep-level substitute model trained plug-and-play for text classification, generating adversarial candidates from multiple methods and selecting the most effective one.

Result: CEMA achieves high attack success with as few as 100 queries across diverse tasks (e.g., classification, translation) and targets commercial APIs and models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: CEMA is a versatile and effective solution for real-world multi-task adversarial attacks, overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A blockchain-based framework, \Sys, is introduced to detect data poisoning in federated learning by decentralizing the global server's role and using a consensus-based judge model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning ensures privacy but is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and current detection methods lack standardization or trust.

Method: \Sys decentralizes the global server's role, introduces a judge model for poisoning detection, and uses blockchain for consensus on the judge model.

Result: The framework is robust against data poisoning and scalable in judge model creation.

Conclusion: \Sys effectively addresses data poisoning vulnerabilities in federated learning through decentralization and consensus.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MAESTRO framework to address security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered autonomous agents, identifying threats like resource denial of service and memory poisoning, and proposes multilayered defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and mitigate security risks in agentic AI systems used for network monitoring and decision-making.

Method: Used the MAESTRO framework with a seven-layer threat model, built a prototype with Python, LangChain, and WebSockets, and tested it with two threat cases.

Result: Identified performance degradation due to threats like traffic replay and memory poisoning, suggesting multilayered defenses for resilience.

Conclusion: MAESTRO is effective for threat mapping and resilient system design, emphasizing memory integrity and cross-layer protection for reliable agentic AI.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

TL;DR: A security framework for EMSs addresses cybersecurity vulnerabilities using a multi-point attack model and GenAI-based anomaly detection, validated on the IEEE 14-Bus system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle dynamic cybersecurity threats and system problems in EMSs by integrating novel methodologies.

Method: Proposes a multi-point attack model, GenAI-based anomaly detection, and a SoM-GI framework for multimodal analysis.

Result: Effective vulnerability identification and anomaly detection, validated on the IEEE 14-Bus system.

Conclusion: Combining numerical and visual analysis enhances EMS security against cyber threats and errors.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the

*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A search-based framework using LLMs to simulate and improve privacy-critical agent interactions, uncovering evolving attack and defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy threat posed by malicious LLM-based agents that extract sensitive information through multi-turn interactions.

Method: A framework alternating between attacker and defender instruction improvements via simulated interactions among data subject, sender, and recipient roles, using LLMs for optimization.

Result: Discovered escalating attack tactics (e.g., impersonation) and advancing defenses (e.g., identity-verification), applicable across scenarios and models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies and mitigates privacy threats, aiding the development of privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A machine learning framework detects and classifies False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids using ANN for real-time detection and Bidirectional LSTM for attack classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDIAs threaten smart grids, especially Home Area Networks (HANs), due to weak security and potential for grid disruption.

Method: Lightweight ANN detects FDIAs using energy, cost, and time features. Bidirectional LSTM classifies attack types (normal, trapezoidal, sigmoid) from synthetic time-series data.

Result: Models effectively identify and classify FDIAs, enhancing grid resilience.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, data-driven defense for smart grid cybersecurity at residential endpoints.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Water4MU, a novel machine unlearning (MU) approach using digital watermarking to enhance data-level adjustments for precise data removal while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in MU methods by exploring data-level adjustments, leveraging watermarking to improve unlearning effectiveness and compliance with data privacy regulations.

Method: Proposes Water4MU, a bi-level optimization framework: upper level optimizes watermarking for easier unlearning, lower level trains the model independently.

Result: Water4MU outperforms existing methods, especially in challenging MU scenarios, and works well for image classification and generation tasks.

Conclusion: Water4MU effectively integrates watermarking into MU, offering a controlled and precise unlearning mechanism with maintained model utility.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing alert fatigue, high false positives, and the challenge of analyzing vast unstructured CTI in cybersecurity.

Method: Hybrid retrieval mechanism combining NLP-based similarity searches and standardized queries, augmented by LLM-powered response generation.

Result: Enhanced IR accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency, validated via automated and expert evaluation.

Conclusion: LLM-driven CTI fusion advances autonomous security operations, laying groundwork for adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

### [315] [Advances in Logic-Based Entity Resolution: Enhancing ASPEN with Local Merges and Optimality Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10504)
*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ASPEN+ extends ASPEN for collective entity resolution by adding local merges and new optimality criteria, improving accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASPEN only supports global merges, which may not suit cases where local merges are more appropriate (e.g., ambiguous names like 'J. Lee'). ASPEN+ addresses this limitation.

Method: ASPEN+ introduces local merges and new optimality criteria (e.g., minimizing rule violations or maximizing rule support). It formalizes and computationally analyzes these notions.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows improved accuracy and runtime due to local merges and new criteria.

Conclusion: ASPEN+ enhances entity resolution by supporting local merges and offering flexible optimality criteria, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

### [316] [Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460)
*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRMMA and MMA for improving sparse trajectory data quality, focusing on trajectory recovery and map matching, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse, low-sampling-rate trajectories misaligned with road networks hinder application performance, necessitating methods to enhance data quality.

Method: TRMMA (trajectory recovery) and MMA (map matching) are proposed. MMA classifies GPS points to road segments, while TRMMA infers missing points using dual-transformers and decoding techniques.

Result: TRMMA and MMA outperform existing methods on 4 real-world datasets, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address sparse trajectory challenges, offering high-quality data for applications.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports
plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language

modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters
(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,
and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active
learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and
iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also
release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and
5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.
Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing
baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up
to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the
longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: FROGENT is an AI-driven agent integrating diverse drug discovery tools via a Large Language Model, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented AI tools in drug discovery create inefficiencies, prompting the need for a unified, agentic framework like FROGENT.

Method: FROGENT combines a Large Language Model with the Model Context Protocol to integrate databases, tool libraries, and AI models for dynamic workflow execution.

Result: FROGENT triples baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction profiling, surpassing models like Qwen3-32B and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: FROGENT enhances researcher productivity by streamlining drug discovery workflows, demonstrating practical utility and generalization.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

*Jyotishka Datta,Nicholas G. Polson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PPI is extended to handle informative labeling by using inverse probability weighting (IPW), maintaining validity even with varying labeling probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of valid statistical inference with partially labeled data, especially when labeling probabilities vary across units.

Method: Replace PPI's unweighted bias-correction term with IPW (Horvitz-Thompson or Hájek forms) and estimate inclusion probabilities when unknown.

Result: IPW-adjusted PPI with estimated propensities performs similarly to cases with known probabilities, preserving coverage and variance reduction.

Conclusion: IPW-adjusted PPI effectively unites survey sampling and prediction-assisted inference, ensuring validity under varying labeling probabilities.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of static machine unlearning by adapting it to dynamic, online ML pipelines, improving efficiency with logarithmic regret bounds and L-BFGS optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning assumes a static, i.i.d. environment, which doesn't reflect real-world dynamic data streams. The paper aims to adapt unlearning to online settings.

Method: The authors translate batch unlearning to online scenarios using regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. They replace Hessian inversion with online L-BFGS optimization.

Result: Achieved logarithmic regret bounds (O(ln T)) and reduced memory footprint, extending model lifespan before retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method makes unlearning more efficient and practical for dynamic ML pipelines.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

### [321] [An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879)
*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentially private algorithm for stochastic PCA that estimates the top k eigenvectors, overcoming limitations of existing methods in sample size and noise introduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for differentially private stochastic PCA either require large sample sizes or introduce excessive noise, especially for estimating multiple eigenvectors.

Method: The proposed algorithm estimates the top k eigenvectors for arbitrary k ≤ d, improving upon prior work limited to k=1. It achieves near-optimal statistical error for k=1 and matches utility guarantees of DP-PCA.

Result: The algorithm performs well even with n = Õ(d) and provides a lower bound for k > 1, matching the upper bound up to a factor of k. Experimental results show its advantages over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is the first to efficiently estimate multiple eigenvectors under differential privacy, addressing key limitations of prior work.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memory formation in Hopfield networks, linking attractor dynamics and connection weights, revealing bifurcations that create or destroy memories, including spurious ones and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ANNs form memories and develop flaws like spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting, given their black-box nature and high dimensionality.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning, focusing on bifurcations leading to attractor formation and destruction.

Result: Stimuli induce bifurcations (pitchfork and saddle-node) creating new attractors for memories, with memorization and forgetting as manifestations of the same mechanism.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into memory mechanisms in recurrent ANNs and could help mitigate flaws like catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance computational efficiency and accuracy in predicting electronic band structures of 2D materials.

Method: Uses a multi-head ResNet-6 architecture with specialized pathways (K-head, M-head, General head) and physics-informed features, along with progressive Dirac constraint scheduling.

Result: Achieves 99.99% training loss reduction, predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 µeV, and enforces all twelve C6v symmetry operations.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate and efficient prediction of band structures, paving the way for broader applications in 2D materials.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show ASR models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, prompting research into attack robustness and defenses.

Method: The study relaxes the optimization objective from complete to partial suppression to reduce attack perceptibility and tests a low-pass filter defense.

Result: Partial suppression increases attack imperceptibility, and a low-pass filter proves effective as a defense.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for robust defenses against adversarial attacks on ASR models, with low-pass filters being a promising solution.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

TL;DR: Benchmarking 11 DL models for bioacoustic tasks shows fine-tuning is crucial, with ResNet excelling in separating background sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of audio-pretrained DL models for bioacoustic tasks without fine-tuning and identify their limitations.

Method: Benchmarked 11 DL models by reducing their embeddings' dimensionality and evaluating through clustering on bioacoustic tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned ones; ResNet excels in background separation; performance improves with fewer background sounds.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning audio-pretrained models is essential, and embedding quality must be verified post-fine-tuning.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after

TL;DR: A post-processing neural network (PuttNet) is proposed to reduce artifacts from speech enhancement models, improving speech quality metrics like PESQ, STOI, and CBAK.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech enhancement networks often introduce artifacts that degrade audio quality, necessitating a solution to mitigate these distortions.

Method: Proposes PuttNet, a post-processing model inspired by golf's 'Putt' analogy, alternating it with a speech enhancement model.

Result: Alternating PuttNet with the enhancement model improves speech quality (PESQ, STOI, CBAK) and outperforms repeated use of either model alone.

Conclusion: PuttNet effectively reduces artifacts and enhances speech quality when alternated with a speech enhancement model.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Motivation: Addressing the performance degradation of deepfake audio countermeasures in cross-domain scenarios, especially on social media.

Method: Proposes the FSW dataset, benchmarks SSL-based CMs, and evaluates data augmentation strategies.

Result: Achieves an average EER of 3.54% across evaluation sets by augmenting datasets and using FSW.

Conclusion: The FSW dataset and augmentation strategies significantly improve real-world deepfake speech detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation

*Juchan Kim,Inwoo Tae,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper introduces decision-focused learning (DFL) for portfolio optimization, showing it outperforms traditional methods by directly optimizing decision quality rather than prediction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods like MSE minimization may lead to suboptimal investment decisions, prompting the need for a decision-focused approach.

Method: The authors use DFL, theoretically deriving gradients of decision loss and leveraging the analytic solution of GMVP and its principal components.

Result: DFL-based methods consistently outperform prediction-focused methods in empirical evaluations, delivering superior decision performance.

Conclusion: DFL is effective for GMVP construction, offering better volatility reduction and decision-driven features compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

Result: Largest LLMs (~70B) matched human accuracy and neural patterns; LLM representations clustered abstract patterns, correlating with human FRPs.

Conclusion: LLMs may mirror human brain mechanisms in abstract reasoning, hinting at shared principles between biological and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

### [330] [Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Dynamical Alignment,' showing that a fixed neural network's computational modes are driven by input dynamics, not static architecture. This resolves SNNs' underperformance and reveals bimodal optimization with phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that neural network capabilities are solely determined by static architecture and to resolve the underperformance of spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging input dynamics.

Method: Encodes static input into dynamical trajectories, revealing a bimodal optimization landscape with phase transitions. Explores 'dissipative' and 'expansive' computational modes.

Result: SNNs can match or exceed artificial neural networks in tasks like classification and reinforcement learning. The advantage stems from timescale alignment between input dynamics and neuronal integration.

Conclusion: Computation can be dynamically shaped by input dynamics on fixed hardware, suggesting a shift in AI research from static architectures to adaptive, dynamic computation principles.

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

TL;DR: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge focused on predicting human brain activity from long, multimodal movies, using fMRI data from four participants. The winning teams excelled in predicting OOD brain activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance computational neuroscience by developing models that predict brain activity from complex stimuli, pushing beyond previous editions' simpler inputs.

Method: Teams used fMRI data from participants watching 80 hours of movies (training on 65 hours, validating on 15). The top models predicted brain activity for held-out OOD films.

Result: Winners were announced, with the top team excelling in OOD prediction. The MedARC team placed 4th, reflecting on effective approaches.

Conclusion: The challenge highlights progress in brain encoding models and suggests future directions for handling naturalistic stimuli.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

TL;DR: A novel MTL framework integrates tabular and non-tabular data with TinyBERT embeddings and a sampling technique to optimize personalized product search ranking, outperforming baselines like XGBoost and TabNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personalized product search ranking by leveraging mixed data types and advanced embedding techniques in a multi-task learning setup.

Method: Combines TinyBERT for semantic embeddings, a novel sampling technique, and a scalable relevance labeling mechanism based on click data. Evaluated against XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2, and MMoE.

Result: The model significantly outperforms baselines, with ablation studies highlighting the importance of relevance labels, TinyBERT fine-tuning, and embedding interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed MTL framework effectively improves personalized product search ranking by integrating diverse data types and advanced techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

*Michael Weiss,Robert Rosenbach,Christian Eggenberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper compares optimizing product recommendations for CTR vs. ACR/OSR, finding OSR yields a 5x higher GMV uplift without harming new product discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether optimizing for CTR or ACR/OSR better aligns with e-commerce business goals like GMV.

Method: Conducted an online A/B test comparing CTR and OSR optimization.

Result: Optimizing for OSR produced a GMV uplift over 5x higher than CTR, with no loss in new product discovery. Feature importance also varied by objective.

Conclusion: OSR optimization is more effective for GMV uplift in e-commerce compared to CTR, while maintaining discovery benefits.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

*Ze Liu,Xianquan Wang,Shuochen Liu,Jie Ma,Huibo Xu,Yupeng Han,Zhe Yang,Kai Zhang,Longfei Li,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CrossDenoise is a lightweight framework for denoising implicit feedback in recommender systems by disentangling noise into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors, outperforming baselines with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit feedback in recommender systems is noisy, degrading accuracy. Existing methods lack entity-aware modeling, are computationally heavy, or require excessive tuning.

Method: CrossDenoise disentangles noise into user, item, and interaction factors, using entity reputation and interaction-level weights derived from empirical data.

Result: Outperforms baselines on ML-1M, Yelp, and Amazon-book datasets, achieving up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy samples, offering a practical, scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

### [335] [Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection and Dimensional Separation in Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10533)
*Michael Poppel,David Bucher,Maximilian Zorn,Nico Kraus,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in quantum machine learning (QML) models, particularly regression failures due to insufficient trainable parameters despite the presence of relevant frequencies. It proposes techniques like frequency selection and dimensional separation to reduce parameter growth and improve trainability, demonstrating success on real quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the practical failures of QML models in regression tasks, which occur despite the theoretical advantages of angle encoding and feature maps in generating universal function approximations.

Method: The method involves frequency selection and dimensional separation to constrain the exponential growth of parameters. This restricts the model to essential frequencies and mixed frequencies only among interdependent dimensions.

Result: The proposed techniques reduce parameter requirements, enabling successful training on noisy quantum simulators and inference on real quantum hardware, even for previously intractable problems.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights that constraining parameter growth through frequency selection and dimensional separation expands the set of tractable QML problems on current hardware, improving practical applicability.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing importance of DL in quantum science and technology, emphasizing its potential to solve complex problems while acknowledging its limitations.

Method: The method involves a comprehensive, graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining conceptual explanations with practical examples.

Result: The result is a structured guide that helps readers understand when and how to apply DL effectively in quantum research, while being aware of its constraints.

Conclusion: The conclusion underscores the need for responsible adaptation of DL in quantum science, balancing its transformative potential with scientific rigor.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

TL;DR: A native three-qubit entangling gate is introduced, enabling control-control-target and control-target-target operations in one step, outperforming traditional two-qubit gate decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quantum computing by leveraging native multiqubit interactions for robust and efficient operations.

Method: Hybrid optimization amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, tested across computational subspaces.

Result: The gate performs robustly in GHZ state preparation, Toffoli-class logic, and controlled-ZZ gate applications, enhancing stabilizer measurements.

Conclusion: This gate paves the way for advanced superconducting quantum processors by integrating native multiqubit interactions.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

TL;DR: Machine learning models (DNN and XGBoost) predict 3D temperature and wind structures of tidally-locked exoplanets, offering a fast alternative to traditional GCMs with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient 3D climate models to interpret exoplanet observational data from missions like JWST and Ariel, given the computational limitations of GCMs.

Method: Training dense neural networks (DNN) and decision trees (XGBoost) on a 3D GCM grid of 60 inflated hot Jupiters to predict atmospheric conditions.

Result: ML models predict temperatures accurately (within 32 ppm for most planets), with minimal impact on gas chemistry and cloud formation.

Conclusion: ML emulators provide a reliable, fast tool for exoplanet studies, complementing traditional GCMs.

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an ensemble of two neural networks for classifying jets in high-energy physics, outperforming traditional methods by converting jet data into 2D histograms and leveraging dual-network strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional jet classification methods struggle with the complex, multidimensional structure of jets, prompting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to improve accuracy.

Method: The study employs an ensemble of two neural networks, converting jet data into two-dimensional histograms for classification. The model is tested on the JetNet dataset for tagging jets into categories like Top Quarks, Light Quarks, and W/Z bosons.

Result: The Ensemble Model demonstrates superior performance in both binary and multi-categorical classification compared to individual networks.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach effectively captures jet features and improves classification accuracy, offering a promising tool for high-energy physics research.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

Motivation: To address the scarcity of data and complexity of analog circuit knowledge by creating a specialized foundation model.

Method: Uses a corpus collection strategy, granular knowledge distillation, and a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm.

Result: Achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, a 15.67% improvement over the original model, and performs well in operational amplifier design.

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker is effective for analog circuit design and is open-sourced for research use.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations, addressing gaps in current research.

Method: Systematic evaluation of equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset, with and without long-range dispersion and electrostatics, tested on various systems.

Result: Larger models improve benchmark accuracy but not simulation properties. Training data composition affects predictions. Long-range electrostatics inconsistently impact systems, except for Trp-cage.

Conclusion: Imbalanced datasets and evaluation practices currently limit the use of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

Result: Early layers (1-7) better capture speaker traits; Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU Kids, and 95.00% on PFSTAR.

Conclusion: Speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth, enabling targeted strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

### [344] [Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10055)
*Alokesh Manna,Sujit K. Ghosh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, using hierarchical models and spike-and-slab priors, with an efficient MCMC algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses variable selection in time series applications with lagged covariates and autoregressive errors, common in fields like finance and hydrology.

Method: Uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors and a two-stage MCMC algorithm for efficient computation.

Result: Demonstrates improved variable selection accuracy, predictive performance, and robustness in simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing methods in MSPE, model identification, and handling autocorrelated noise, proving practical for autoregressive settings.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

### [345] [Exploring Content and Social Connections of Fake News with Explainable Text and Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10040)
*Vítor N. Lourenço,Aline Paes,and Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explainable framework for fact-checking that combines content, social media, and graph-based features to improve accuracy and provide interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of misinformation and limitations of traditional fact-checking methods (e.g., content analysis alone or simple labeling) drive the need for a more holistic and explainable approach.

Method: The proposed framework integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability techniques, leveraging multimodal data (content, social media dynamics, and graph features) for fact-checking.

Result: Experiments show improved performance over single-modality approaches across English, Spanish, and Portuguese datasets. The framework also provides human-understandable explanations, validated for interpretability and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances fact-checking by combining multimodal data and explainability, addressing both accuracy and transparency challenges.

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SABIA, a hybrid deep learning model (BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN) for detecting opioid-related behaviors on social media, outperforming baselines by 9.30% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media data is valuable for public health but challenging due to informal language and slang, especially for detecting opioid misuse.

Method: Developed SABIA, a hybrid model combining BERT, BiLSTM, and 3CNN, with steps including data preprocessing, representation, fine-tuning, and classification into five user behavior categories.

Result: SABIA achieved benchmark performance, improving accuracy by 9.30% over Logistic Regression (LR=0.86) and outperforming seven previous studies.

Conclusion: Hybrid deep learning models like SABIA are effective for detecting complex opioid-related behaviors on social media, aiding public health efforts.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

*Zhuoyuan Yu,Yuxing Long,Zihan Yang,Chengyan Zeng,Hongwei Fan,Jiyao Zhang,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-correction Flywheel, a post-training paradigm to enhance error correction in vision-and-language navigation models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack effective error correction, leading to deviations from correct trajectories. The study aims to leverage error trajectories as valuable data for self-correction.

Method: The proposed paradigm identifies deviations in error trajectories and generates self-correction data for perception and action, fueling iterative model training.

Result: CorrectNav achieves 65.1% and 69.3% success rates on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, surpassing prior models by 8.2% and 16.4%. Real robot tests confirm superior error correction and navigation.

Conclusion: The Self-correction Flywheel paradigm significantly improves model performance by iteratively refining error correction capabilities, validated by benchmarks and real-world tests.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASH, a cooperative-heterogeneous MARL method for single humanoid robot locomotion, treating limbs as independent agents with a shared critic, improving training and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use single-agent RL for single robots or MARL for multi-robot tasks, but this work explores MARL for single-robot locomotion to enhance efficiency.

Method: MASH treats each limb as an independent agent, using cooperative-heterogeneous MARL with a shared global critic to optimize locomotion.

Result: MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation, outperforming single-agent RL methods.

Conclusion: The work advances MARL integration into single-humanoid control, offering efficient locomotion strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReconVLA improves Vision-Language-Action models by guiding visual attention to target regions using a reconstructive approach with a diffusion transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs struggle with dispersed visual attention, limiting their ability to focus on target regions for precise manipulation.

Method: Proposes ReconVLA, which reconstructs gaze regions using a diffusion transformer to guide visual attention and learn fine-grained representations.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in precise manipulation and generalization, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ReconVLA effectively addresses visual attention allocation in VLAs, enhancing task-specific performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

### [350] [The SET Perceptual Factors Framework: Towards Assured Perception for Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10798)
*Troi Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SET Perceptual Factors Framework to systematically analyze and quantify perceptual risks in autonomous systems, aiming to improve safety and public trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about the reliability of robot perception, which is critical for safe decision-making and public trust in autonomous systems.

Method: The framework uses SET State Trees and SET Factor Trees to categorize and model perceptual risks, followed by Perceptual Factor Models to quantify uncertainty.

Result: A transparent and standardized method for identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks in autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The SET framework enhances safety assurances and fosters public trust by systematically addressing perceptual uncertainties.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

*Henry Powell,Guy Laban,Emily S. Cross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a multimodal attention network to model subjective self-disclosure in human-robot interactions, achieving a significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computational models for subjective self-disclosure, especially in human-robot interactions, as social robots increasingly need to understand human social cues.

Method: A custom multimodal attention network, trained on a self-collected video corpus, with a novel scale-preserving cross-entropy loss function.

Result: The model achieves an F1 score of 0.83, a 0.48 improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: The work advances the ability of social robots to detect self-disclosures, a key component of social cognition.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using A2C optimizes satellite orbital parameters for precise terrestrial coverage, outperforming PPO in efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LEO congestion and collision risks, the paper aims to improve satellite deployment efficiency and safety.

Method: Uses A2C in a custom OpenAI Gym environment to adjust orbital parameters via MDP, simulating dynamics with Keplerian elements.

Result: A2C achieves 5.8x higher rewards and 31.5x faster convergence than PPO, meeting mission objectives efficiently.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, particularly A2C, is a viable, efficient method for scalable LEO mission planning.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: The paper explores Echo State Network (ESN) performance using benchmark problems and proposes heuristics for configuring its architecture and parameters to assist newcomers in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of understanding parameter and architecture effects on ESN performance, especially for those lacking experience.

Method: The authors tested ESN on four benchmark tasks (time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification) to analyze performance impacts.

Result: The experiments demonstrated how parameter and architectural choices influence ESN performance, providing insights for optimal configurations.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical heuristics for ESN configuration, bridging the experience gap for newcomers and highlighting the importance of parameter selection.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

TL;DR: DINOMotion is a deep learning framework for robust, efficient, and interpretable motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy struggle with large misalignments and lack interpretability.

Method: DINOMotion uses DINOv2 with LoRA layers for landmark detection and image registration, reducing trainable parameters and improving efficiency.

Result: Achieves high Dice scores (92.07% kidney, 90.90% liver, 95.23% lung) and low Hausdorff distances (5.47mm, 8.31mm, 6.72mm), processing scans in ~30ms.

Conclusion: DINOMotion is a promising solution for real-time, interpretable motion tracking in radiotherapy.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Conclusion: CNN-based approaches with explainability offer fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between research and real-world clinical deployment of surgical video analysis, addressing challenges like annotation scarcity and domain variability.

Method: Benchmarked neural network architectures, proposed novel designs, and developed semi-supervised frameworks (DIST, SemiVT-Surge, ENCORE) to reduce reliance on labeled data.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on surgical datasets, released multi-task datasets (GynSurg, Cataract-1K), and improved data efficiency.

Conclusion: The work advances robust, scalable AI solutions for surgical video analysis, supporting clinical care and training.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high demand for efficient image denoising due to the abundance of imaging data and devices.

Method: Haar-tSVD combines tensor-SVD projection with the Haar transform to capture global and local patch correlations, avoiding the need for learning local bases. An adaptive noise estimation scheme using CNN and eigenvalue analysis is also introduced.

Result: Experiments show Haar-tSVD effectively balances denoising speed and performance, excelling in noise removal and detail preservation.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD is a robust, efficient, and adaptable denoising method, validated by real-world tasks, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated

and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

### [358] [DIVA-VQA: Detecting Inter-frame Variations in UGC Video Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10605)
*Xinyi Wang,Angeliki Katsenou,David Bull*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel NR-VQA model using spatio-temporal fragmentation and inter-frame variations achieves top performance on UGC datasets with low runtime complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of UGC demands efficient NR-VQA for quality monitoring without pristine references.

Method: Leverages inter-frame differences to analyze quality at multiple levels (frames, patches, fragmented frames) and integrates 2D/3D features.

Result: Ranked top 2 in performance (DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898, DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886) and top in speed.

Conclusion: The model effectively captures global/local quality variations, offering high accuracy and efficiency for NR-VQA.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are
publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/DIVA-VQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify segmentation uncertainty in cranial blood vessel annotations, which can improve annotation processes and automatic segmentation.

Method: Analyze variability among segmentations performed by multiple annotators on 2D DSA images.

Result: Quantified segmentation uncertainty and identified its potential uses.

Conclusion: Segmentation uncertainty can guide additional annotations and inform uncertainty-aware automatic segmentation methods.

Abstract: We analyze the variability among segmentations of cranial blood vessels in 2D
DSA performed by multiple annotators in order to characterize and quantify
segmentation uncertainty. We use this analysis to quantify segmentation
uncertainty and discuss ways it can be used to guide additional annotations and
to develop uncertainty-aware automatic segmentation methods.

### [360] [Legal Zero-Days: A Novel Risk Vector for Advanced AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10050)
*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Legal Zero-Days' as hidden legal vulnerabilities in AI systems, presents a risk model, and uses a case study to show their disruptive potential. It also develops a method to evaluate AI systems for detecting such vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight undiscovered legal vulnerabilities in AI systems that can cause societal disruption without prior litigation, emphasizing the need for proactive risk assessment.

Method: Proposes a risk model for identifying Legal Zero-Days, uses the 2017 Australian dual citizenship crisis as a case study, and develops 'legal puzzles' to evaluate AI systems.

Result: Current AI models may not reliably find impactful Legal Zero-Days, but future systems could, posing risks and opportunities for legal robustness.

Conclusion: The work advances efforts to identify and mitigate unrecognized risks from advanced AI systems, stressing the importance of legal robustness.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

### [361] [Advancing Data Equity: Practitioner Responsibility and Accountability in NLP Data Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10071)
*Jay L. Cunningham,Kevin Zhongyang Shao,Rock Yuren Pang,Nathaniel Mengist*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores NLP practitioners' perspectives on data equity, linking their experiences to AI governance and proposing participatory reforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how NLP practitioners perceive and navigate data equity issues, given the lack of focus on their perspectives in existing research.

Method: Uses a 2024 questionnaire and focus group with U.S.-based NLP data practitioners to examine their views on fairness, constraints, and governance efforts like the U.S. AI Bill of Rights.

Result: Reveals tensions between commercial goals and equity commitments, with practitioners advocating for more participatory and accountable workflows.

Conclusion: Improving NLP equity requires structural governance reforms that empower practitioners and ensure community consent, addressing issues like diversity washing.

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

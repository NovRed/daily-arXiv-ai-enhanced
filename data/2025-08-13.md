Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews AI-based techniques for detecting plant diseases and pests, highlighting their superiority over traditional methods, with vision transformers achieving over 99.3% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing crop production and preventing economic losses by improving disease and pest detection using advanced AI methods.

Method: Categorizes detection techniques into hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization, visualization, modified deep learning, and transformer models.

Result: Modern AI methods, especially vision transformers, outperform older techniques in speed and accuracy (e.g., HvT achieves 99.3% accuracy).

Conclusion: The study identifies challenges, proposes solutions, and suggests future research directions for AI-based plant disease detection.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI proposes a framework combining molecular motif sequences and global image features for improved drug-drug interaction prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for DDI prediction are limited by motif-based representation learning, missing global structural insights.

Method: ImageDDI tokenizes molecules into motifs, embeds them with a transformer, and enhances representation using molecular image features via Adaptive Feature Fusion.

Result: ImageDDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs well in 2D/3D image-enhanced scenarios.

Conclusion: ImageDDI effectively integrates local and global molecular features for superior DDI prediction.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

### [3] [Designing Object Detection Models for TinyML: Foundations, Comparative Analysis, Challenges, and Emerging Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08352)
*Christophe EL Zeinaty,Wassim Hamidouche,Glenn Herrou,Daniel Menard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper analyzes optimization techniques for deploying object detection models on resource-constrained IoT devices using TinyML, addressing gaps in existing literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT devices and their limited computational resources necessitate efficient object detection solutions, which current surveys overlook.

Method: The paper reviews optimization techniques like quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search, comparing theoretical and practical implementations.

Result: It evaluates KPIs of existing OD implementations on microcontrollers, assessing their maturity in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment, offering a public repository for ongoing updates in the field.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task- and hardware-agnostic pipeline improves Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) by addressing accuracy gaps and simulation-fabrication discrepancies, using Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD) for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid ONNs are energy-efficient but face accuracy gaps and hardware discrepancies, limiting adoption.

Method: Proposes a task-agnostic pipeline with NTKD for training and fine-tuning, and pre-fabrication accuracy estimation.

Result: Improves ONN performance across datasets and hardware, enabling practical deployment.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively bridges accuracy gaps and supports diverse optical systems.

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS is a multi-agent framework for long-sequence video storytelling, addressing poor assistive capability, visual quality, and expressiveness by orchestrating specialized agents under the 3E Principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current long-sequence video generation frameworks, such as poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness.

Method: MAViS employs specialized agents across stages (script writing, shot designing, etc.) under the 3E Principle (Explore, Examine, Enhance) and uses Script Writing Guidelines for compatibility.

Result: MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and expressiveness, producing high-quality, expressive videos with narratives and music.

Conclusion: MAViS is a scalable, modular framework that enhances creativity and is the only one offering multimodal design output (videos with narratives and music).

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON is a unified multi-garment diffusion framework for virtual try-on, preserving identity and garment fidelity better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods handle garments separately, require heavy preprocessing, and fail to preserve personal identity cues like tattoos and body shape, limiting realism.

Method: Proposes MuGa-VTON with three modules: Garment Representation Module (GRM), Person Representation Module (PRM), and A-DiT fusion module, integrating garment, person, and text-prompt features via diffusion transformer.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks, producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results.

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON offers a flexible, realistic solution for virtual try-on, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CObL is a diffusion-based model that infers an occlusion-ordered stack of object layers from images, generalizing to real-world scenes without prior knowledge of object count or user prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve scene understanding by grouping pixels into objects and capturing their spatial relationships, including occlusion and depth.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based architecture (CObL) with Stable Diffusion as a prior and inference-time guidance to ensure layers composite back to the input image. Trained on synthetic multi-object tabletop scenes.

Result: Zero-shot generalization to real-world tabletop photos with novel objects, reconstructing multiple occluded objects without prior knowledge or prompts.

Conclusion: CObL advances unsupervised object-centric learning by handling real-world scenes and multiple occluded objects, unlike prior models limited to training domains.

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

### [8] [Re:Verse -- Can Your VLM Read a Manga?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08508)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current VLMs excel at single-panel recognition but fail in deep narrative reasoning, especially in temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion. A new evaluation framework reveals these gaps, showing VLMs struggle with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in VLMs' ability to understand sequential visual storytelling, particularly in manga narratives, where deep reasoning and temporal coherence are critical.

Method: Introduced a framework with (i) fine-grained multimodal annotation, (ii) evaluation across reasoning paradigms, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis. Tested on Re:Zero manga with 308 annotated panels.

Result: VLMs lack story-level intelligence, struggling with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for evaluating narrative intelligence in VLMs and highlights their limitations in deep sequential understanding.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR introduces a visual input-based method for controlling Vision Language Models (VLMs) without invasive model access, outperforming existing methods in behavioral control while maintaining performance on unrelated tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling VLMs (like system prompting or activation-based steering) are either detectable, ineffective, or require invasive model access, limiting their practicality.

Method: VISOR crafts optimized visual inputs (steering images) to induce target activation patterns in VLMs, enabling behavioral control without modifying model internals.

Result: VISOR matches or exceeds steering vector performance (1-25% shifts) and outperforms system prompting (3-4% shifts) while maintaining 99.9% performance on unrelated tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR provides robust, imperceptible behavioral control for VLMs and exposes a security vulnerability, highlighting the need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve OCR for historical Japanese documents by using parallel textline images and a distance-based objective function, reducing error rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcribing Kindai documents is labor-intensive, and annotated data for OCR training is scarce.

Method: Leverages parallel textline images (original and contemporary Japanese) with a distance-based objective function (Euclidean distance and MMD) to minimize feature gaps.

Result: Reduces character error rate by 2.23% (Euclidean) and 3.94% (MMD) over a Transformer-based OCR baseline.

Conclusion: The approach enhances OCR performance for historical documents by improving self-attention representations.

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn introduces a per-instance temperature scaling method for ViTs, reducing calibration error by up to 4x with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probability calibration is crucial for Vision Transformers in risk-sensitive applications, but standard methods like temperature scaling are limited by global scalar use and require validation sets.

Method: CalAttn learns adaptive, per-instance temperatures directly from the ViT's CLS token, avoiding the need for a validation set.

Result: CalAttn reduces calibration error significantly (up to 4x) across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K) with under 0.1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: CalAttn is a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic solution for trustworthy probability calibration without accuracy loss.

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

### [12] [Boosting Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549)
*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generic framework (DTLP-Net) is proposed to address challenges in medical image segmentation (SSMIS, Semi-MDG, UMDA) by generating reliable pseudo-labels and enhancing model diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotation and domain shift hinder medical image segmentation. Existing methods are task-specific and suboptimal.

Method: DTLP-Net uses two diverse teacher models to generate pseudo-labels, decouples training, and employs data augmentation and label propagation.

Result: Notable improvements on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks.

Conclusion: DTLP-Net effectively tackles SSL challenges, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

### [13] [Unlocking the Potential of Diffusion Priors in Blind Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08556)
*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET addresses gaps in diffusion models for blind face restoration by switching between Restoration and Degradation modes, outperforming prior methods in authenticity and degradation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between vanilla diffusion models and blind face restoration (BFR) settings, due to discrepancies in image quality and degradation patterns, limits seamless adaptation.

Method: FLIPNET uses a unified network with two modes: Restoration mode integrates BFR-oriented features and face embeddings, while Degradation mode synthesizes real-world-like degraded images.

Result: FLIPNET outperforms previous diffusion-based BFR methods in authenticity and fidelity and surpasses naive degradation models in simulating real-world degradations.

Conclusion: FLIPNET effectively bridges the gap in diffusion models for BFR, offering improved restoration and realistic degradation synthesis.

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

TL;DR: AutoSAME combines SAM's visual understanding with segmentation and landmark localization for LV measurements, introducing FCBA and SGPA to enhance accuracy.


<details>

Motivation: Existing algorithms struggle with small datasets and lack anatomical point identification, critical for LV measurements.

Method: Proposes AutoSAME, integrating SAM with segmentation and landmark tasks, using FCBA for feature enhancement and SGPA for spatial-guided prompts.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and measurements on an echocardiography dataset.

Conclusion: AutoSAME effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, aligning with clinical guidelines for LV measurements.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

*Chenruo Liu,Hongjun Liu,Zeyu Lai,Yiqiu Shen,Chen Zhao,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using superclass information and gradient-based attention to reduce reliance on spurious features, improving robustness without auxiliary annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods require impractical auxiliary annotations and assume identical group sets across domains, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Leverages superclass labels and gradient-based attention guided by a vision-language model to disentangle features, promoting superclass-relevant features.

Result: Outperforms baselines in domain generalization, with improvements in metrics and visualizations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces spurious feature reliance without annotations, enhancing robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

*Jingyun Liang,Jingkai Zhou,Shikai Li,Chenjie Cao,Lei Sun,Yichen Qian,Weihua Chen,Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating realistic human videos with separate control over foreground, background, trajectory, and action by decoupling motion from appearance and using 3D space editing and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack separate control over key video elements (foreground, background, trajectory, action), limiting flexibility in video generation.

Method: Proposes a decomposed control framework: edits motion in 3D space, uses trajectory unprojection, motion banks, and integrates with text-to-video diffusion models for composition.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllability and video quality, demonstrated on benchmarks and real-world cases.

Conclusion: The framework enables flexible, high-quality video generation with precise control over all key elements.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

*Wenwen Yu,Zhibo Yang,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocThinker is a rule-based RL framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning in MLLMs, improving explainability and adaptability in document understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack transparency and reliability in reasoning, especially in high-stakes domains, due to black-box processes and limitations of fixed CoT methods.

Method: Proposes DocThinker, which uses rule-based RL to dynamically refine reasoning strategies, generating explainable intermediate results and integrating multi-objective rewards.

Result: DocThinker enhances generalization, explainability, and adaptability, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: RL is a viable approach for improving transparency and adaptability in MLLM-based document understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

*Yuxiao Wang,Wolin Liang,Yu Lei,Weiying Xue,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QueryCraft improves HOI detection by using semantic priors and guided feature learning via transformer-based query initialization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomly initialized queries in DETR-based HOI detection lack explicit semantics, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes QueryCraft with ACTOR (cross-modal Transformer) for action-relevant features and PDQD for object-level query quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks.

Conclusion: QueryCraft enhances HOI detection with interpretable and effective queries, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance interactive video generation by combining simulation, generation, and editing into a unified, AI-driven paradigm for creative tools and media.

Method: Uses a 3D-VAE for simulation, hierarchical autoregressive captioning for multi-modal generation, and a hybrid model for disentangling mechanics and rendering in editing.

Result: Achieves real-time 1080P/60FPS simulation, flexible domain blending, and multi-granularity editing during interaction.

Conclusion: Yan integrates these capabilities, pushing interactive video generation toward a comprehensive AI-driven creative paradigm.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransMiter is a lightweight adapter for vision-language models (VLMs) that transfers adaptation knowledge across models without backpropagation, improving performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large VLMs is costly, and existing adaptation transfer methods lack transferability and efficiency.

Method: TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs in an unsupervised way, requiring minimal layers and no backpropagation.

Result: TransMiter effectively transfers knowledge across VLMs, often outperforming fine-tuned models with low computational cost.

Conclusion: TransMiter offers a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing VLMs without compromising generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

TL;DR: A self-supervised method for handheld video deblurring using sharp clues in videos, with novel techniques to enhance training and maintain spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handheld mobile phone videos often suffer from blur due to shaking, and existing methods struggle with real-world blur domain gaps.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised approach using sharp clues as labels, a Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring (SEVD) method for better data, and a Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) technique.

Result: Outperforms existing self-supervised methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses handheld video deblurring, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining neural artistic style transfer with color transfer, using KL divergence to evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance artistic expression and image correction by integrating neural artistic style transfer with color transfer techniques.

Method: Uses KL divergence to evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms (Reinhard, IDT, IDT with regrain, Cholesky, PCA) between original and style-transferred images. Estimates color channel kernel densities.

Result: Various experiments evaluate the KL divergence of these algorithms and their color histograms for style-to-content transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively combines neural artistic style transfer with color transfer, providing a quantitative evaluation framework for color matching algorithms.

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HVPL, a Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning model, to address catastrophic forgetting in Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) by learning new object categories without losing old ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIS methods assume fixed object categories and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes. HVPL aims to resolve this by preserving knowledge of old classes while learning new ones.

Method: HVPL uses frame-level and video-level prompts: a task-specific frame prompt with an Orthogonal Gradient Correction (OGC) module for frame-level mitigation, and a video prompt with a context decoder for video-level mitigation.

Result: HVPL outperforms baseline methods in preventing catastrophic forgetting and effectively learning new object categories.

Conclusion: HVPL provides a robust solution for continuous learning in VIS by addressing forgetting at both frame and video levels.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Aligned Manifold Entropy (AME) for robust vision-language knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, improving generalization without modifying backbone architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust knowledge distillation in vision-language models with limited training data, particularly for ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations.

Method: AME minimizes entropy over a reconfigured shared manifold, bridging multi-modal data via projection functions for structural compression of cross-modal features.

Result: AME consistently enhances knowledge distillation across diverse architectures and settings, achieving superior generalization in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AME is a plug-and-play solution for robust vision-language distillation, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

TL;DR: A unified framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation, supporting both source-accessible and source-free settings by learning a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold of anatomical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a structured, generalizable anatomical knowledge construction in prior domain adaptation methods for medical image segmentation.

Method: Introduces a model that learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold representing anatomical regularities, enabling disentangled, interpretable predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both source-accessible and source-free settings, with strong interpretability via manifold traversal.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between source-accessible and source-free settings, offering consistent performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

TL;DR: HiWL is a two-stage deep image watermarking method that improves invisibility, robustness, and broad applicability, outperforming existing methods with 7.6% higher accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to simultaneously meet invisibility, robustness, and broad applicability criteria for watermarking.

Method: HiWL uses hierarchical learning: 1) distribution alignment for latent space consistency, and 2) disentanglement policy for separating watermarks from image content.

Result: Achieves 7.6% higher watermark extraction accuracy and processes 100K images in 8s.

Conclusion: HiWL effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a generalizable solution for image watermarking.

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance medical diagnosis by integrating unique and complementary information from different modalities into a comprehensive image.

Method: Uses an Invertible Dense Network (IDN) for lossless feature extraction and a Multi-scale Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) with hybrid attention, convolutional layers, and Transformers. Introduces an adaptive loss function.

Result: Outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies confirm component effectiveness.

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN is effective for multimodal medical image fusion and shows promise for other image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PADReg, a physics-aware deformable registration framework, improves ultrasound image alignment using contact force and stiffness maps, outperforming existing methods by 21.34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound deformable registration is challenging due to low contrast, noise, and ambiguous tissue boundaries, leading to poor alignment and lack of physical interpretability.

Method: PADReg uses synchronized contact force and constructs a stiffness map to estimate deformation fields, guided by Hooke's law.

Result: Achieves a HD95 of 12.90, 21.34% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PADReg enhances registration accuracy and physical plausibility, validated by in-vivo experiments.

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible

*Tong Sun,Hongliang Ye,Jilin Mei,Liang Chen,Fangzhou Zhao,Leiqiang Zong,Yu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROD introduces an RGB-only method for off-road freespace detection, eliminating LiDAR dependency and achieving high speed (50 FPS) and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-road freespace detection is challenging due to blurred boundaries. Multi-modal methods using LiDAR are slow, making them unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: ROD uses a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for RGB feature extraction and a lightweight decoder for efficiency.

Result: ROD achieves state-of-the-art performance on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets with 50 FPS.

Conclusion: ROD provides a fast, accurate, and LiDAR-free solution for off-road freespace detection.

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

*Qi Zheng,Li-Heng Chen,Chenlong He,Neil Berkbeck,Yilin Wang,Balu Adsumilli,Alan C. Bovik,Yibo Fan,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new video dataset (LIVE-YT-Banding) and a no-reference quality evaluator (CBAND) to address banding artifacts in compressed videos, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Banding artifacts degrade video quality, especially in high-definition videos, but existing datasets lack temporal dynamics. A systematic study and new tools are needed.

Method: Created the LIVE-YT-Banding dataset with 160 AV1-compressed videos and 7,200 subjective opinions. Developed CBAND, a deep learning-based no-reference evaluator.

Result: CBAND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in banding prediction and is faster. It can also optimize debanding models as a differentiable loss.

Conclusion: The LIVE-YT-Banding dataset and CBAND provide valuable resources for banding artifact research, with CBAND offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

*Ouyang Xu,Baoming Zhang,Ruiyu Mao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to repair deep learning models by generating targeted synthetic images for underrepresented subpopulations, filtered by a vision-language model to ensure quality and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systematic errors in visual recognition models caused by underrepresented semantic subpopulations, overcoming limitations of manual synthetic data generation.

Method: Uses a conditional text-to-image model for targeted image generation and a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter outputs, ensuring alignment with the original data distribution.

Result: Significantly reduces errors associated with rare cases, improving model robustness without introducing new bugs.

Conclusion: The proposed repair strategy effectively enhances model performance for underrepresented cases while maintaining semantic consistency and data quality.

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

### [32] [Adaptive Confidence-Wise Loss for Improved Lens Structure Segmentation in AS-OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08705)
*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss for lens structure segmentation, leveraging expert annotation confidence to improve performance, along with a new metric, BECE, for boundary calibration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all pixels equally, ignoring inhomogeneous sub-regions and poor boundary calibration. Expert annotations vary in confidence, inspiring the ACW loss.

Method: ACW groups sub-regions by confidence, applies region-weighted loss, and dynamically optimizes confidence thresholds. BECE quantifies boundary miscalibration.

Result: ACW outperforms CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction in lens segmentation.

Conclusion: ACW effectively leverages expert confidence, improving segmentation accuracy and calibration, especially in boundary regions.

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

*Andrea Montibeller,Dasara Shullani,Daniele Baracchi,Alessandro Piva,Giulia Boato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to emulate social network video compression for improving deepfake detector generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos on social networks challenge deepfake detection due to proprietary compression, which lab-trained detectors fail to generalize to.

Method: Estimates compression and resizing parameters from uploaded videos to emulate platform-specific artifacts locally.

Result: Emulated data matches real upload degradation; detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos perform comparably to those trained on actual shared media.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable solution for bridging the gap between lab training and real-world deployment of deepfake detectors.

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROOMELSA is a benchmark for evaluating 3D retrieval systems in complex, real-world scenarios using natural language queries and panoramic room images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D retrieval systems are limited to simple scenarios, while real-world applications require recognizing objects in cluttered scenes from vague descriptions.

Method: ROOMELSA evaluates systems by retrieving 3D models from a database based on targeted queries in panoramic room images, using a large dataset of apartment scenes and rooms.

Result: While coarse retrieval is solved, only one top model consistently ranked correct matches first. A lightweight CLIP-based model performed well but struggled with subtle variations.

Conclusion: ROOMELSA bridges scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, setting a new benchmark for robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

*Tianyu Xiong,Dayi Tan,Wei Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPose-Animal is a diffusion-based framework for animal pose estimation, leveraging LLMs for semantic guidance and a diffusion-based decoder for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal pose estimation is challenging due to morphological diversity, complex structures, and limited data, requiring innovative solutions.

Method: Reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process using diffusion models, integrates LLMs for anatomical priors, and employs a diffusion-based decoder.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and generalization on diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal offers a robust and biologically meaningful approach to animal pose estimation.

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Mengxi Guo,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPO-AdaSharp is a region-adaptive video sharpening model that optimizes bit allocation for perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sharpening degrades video quality and increases bitrate without considering texture variations.

Method: Uses coding tree unit (CTU) partition masks to guide bit allocation in an end-to-end model.

Result: Effective in benchmarks, improving quality and saving bitrate.

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp successfully addresses the limitations of uniform sharpening.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoPartNeRF improves monocular dynamic human rendering by addressing unnatural transitions and occlusion issues with bidirectional deformation, part-based pose embedding, and dynamic texture modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex pose variations and occlusions in monocular settings, leading to unnatural transitions and inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: Proposes MonoPartNeRF with bidirectional deformation, part-based pose embedding, keyframe pose retrieval, and dynamic texture modeling via attention.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets, achieving better joint alignment, texture fidelity, and structural continuity.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF effectively handles complex poses and occlusions, offering smoother transitions and robust occlusion recovery.

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

*Luis S. Luevano,Pavel Korshunov,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for aging/de-aging faces by editing StyleGAN2's latent space using SVM and feature selection, ensuring identity preservation with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for face aging/de-aging rely on complex conditioning, leading to training challenges and inconsistent identity preservation.

Method: Uses SVM and feature selection in StyleGAN2's latent space to define aging/de-aging directions, validated by two face recognition systems for identity preservation.

Result: Generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages, with a formula for parameter limits to ensure identity preservation.

Conclusion: The method offers a simpler, practical approach for age synthesis with guaranteed identity preservation, useful for benchmarking and applications.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are

*Shi-Chen Zhang,Yunheng Li,Yu-Huan Wu,Qibin Hou,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses misalignment in semantic segmentation by proposing a dual-branch offset learning paradigm, OffSeg, improving efficiency without major architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight semantic segmentation methods suffer from misalignment between class representations and image features due to per-pixel classification.

Method: A coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm dynamically refines class representations and spatial image features.

Result: OffSeg improves performance on datasets like ADE20K, Cityscapes, and others, with minimal additional parameters (e.g., +2.7% mIoU for SegFormer-B0).

Conclusion: The offset learning paradigm effectively enhances semantic segmentation efficiency and can be integrated into existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token-Aware LoRA (TARA) to address identity loss and feature leakage in multi-concept text-to-image generation using LoRA modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based methods struggle with multi-concept generation due to token-wise interference and spatial misalignment.

Method: TARA uses token masks to constrain module focus and a training objective for spatial alignment.

Result: TARA enables training-free multi-concept composition and preserves visual identities effectively.

Conclusion: TARA improves multi-concept generation by mitigating interference and misalignment issues.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Result: Outperforms previous methods by 15% in image classification pretraining and improves CLIP's part segmentation accuracy by 55%.

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM effectively enhances MLLMs' spatial reasoning and has practical applications in improving vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel NR-IQA framework using Anisotropic Texture Richness (ATR) achieves high accuracy in artifact classification and quality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust tool for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) that can classify and quantify image degradation effectively.

Method: The framework uses ATR, computed with tunable thresholds, to classify artifacts (blur vs. noise) and predict quality via regression.

Result: Achieves 97% artifact classification accuracy and high predictive performance (R2=0.892, RMSE=5.17 DMOS).

Conclusion: The framework is a dual-purpose tool for accurate classification and quantification of image degradation.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing in video coding to balance quality and bitrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency components are essential for video clarity but increase bitrate and costs. The goal is to optimize the tradeoff between quality and bitrate.

Method: The framework uses the Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict optimal preprocessing strategies, trained with pseudo-labels based on rate-distortion performance.

Result: The framework enhances subjective quality and saves bitrate, as demonstrated by evaluations on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances video quality and bitrate through adaptive high-frequency preprocessing.

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting neural models to scene changes are either labor-intensive or fail to capture detailed changes, necessitating a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: GaussianUpdate uses a 3D Gaussian representation and continual learning with a multi-stage update strategy and visibility-aware generative replay.

Result: The method achieves superior real-time rendering and effectively visualizes changes over time on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate provides a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic scene adaptation in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for depth estimation in light field imaging are computationally expensive and perform poorly in noisy environments.

Method: Proposes a pipeline integrating light field disparity with a directed random walk refinement algorithm, avoiding extensive training or large datasets.

Result: Evaluated on benchmark and real-world images, the method maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy, though slightly less robust in uncontrolled conditions.

Conclusion: The method is a practical, efficient alternative for depth estimation, with potential for integrating probabilistic graph models in future work.

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning dense and informative semantic features from 3D point clouds using standard ViTs is underexplored.

Method: MaskClu integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning, reconstructing cluster assignments and centers, and employs global contrastive learning for instance-level feature enhancement.

Result: MaskClu achieves competitive results in 3D tasks like part segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification.

Conclusion: MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful representations from 3D point clouds, validated by strong performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

TL;DR: The study introduces a pipeline for automated postoperative CNS tumor analysis using Attention U-Net and DenseNet architectures, achieving high accuracy in segmentation and classification, integrated into Raidionics software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated tumor analysis focuses on preoperative data, leaving a gap in postoperative imaging evaluation, which is crucial for clinical decision-making.

Method: The pipeline uses Attention U-Net for segmentation (tumor core, residual tumor, resection cavity) and DenseNet for MR sequence and tumor type classification, trained on multicentric datasets with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Segmentation models achieved Dice scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for different tumor components, while classification models reached 99.5% and 80% accuracy for MR sequence and tumor type, respectively.

Conclusion: The pipeline enhances postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making, integrated into Raidionics for standardized reporting aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

*Jintao Cheng,Jiehao Luo,Xieyuanli Chen,Jin Wu,Rui Fan,Xiaoyu Tang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel cross-view network for LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) to address limitations of Euclidean distance-based methods, introducing a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism and a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric for improved performance in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LPR methods rely on Euclidean distance-based metric learning, ignoring intrinsic feature space structures and intra-class variances, leading to suboptimal performance in complex or dynamic scenarios.

Method: The proposed framework uses a cross-view network with a pseudo-global information guidance mechanism and a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality Learning Metric, replacing Euclidean distance with Mahalanobis distance via an SPD matrix.

Result: The algorithm achieves competitive performance, especially in complex environmental conditions, by better capturing nonlinear data distributions and inter-class dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms traditional Euclidean-centric approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness in LPR tasks for GPS-denied environments and loop closure detection.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel robotic system integrates real-time shape completion with ultrasound imaging to improve spinal visualization, addressing shadowing artifacts and registration limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging is hindered by shadowing artifacts and traditional CT-to-US registration methods face challenges like complex registration and spine curvature differences.

Method: The system uses a robotic platform to autonomously acquire US sweeps, extract vertebral surfaces, and reconstruct anatomy with a deep learning-based shape completion network.

Result: The framework provides real-time visualization, repeatable scans, and navigation capabilities, validated through quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: The integrated system enhances consistency, reproducibility, and anatomical understanding in spinal procedures.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Motivation: Volumetric data compression is essential in fields like medical imaging and scientific simulation, but traditional methods often involve redundant computation and hierarchical metadata.

Method: Combines Fourier-feature encoding with dynamic voxel selection using morphological dilation to prioritize active regions, eliminating hierarchical metadata.

Result: Training time reduced by 63.7% (30 to 11 minutes) with minor quality loss (PSNR drop of 0.59 dB, SSIM drop of 0.008). Achieves a compression rate of 14.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, structure-free solution for efficient volumetric compression, connecting coordinate-based neural representation with practical applications.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot approach for Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) using CLIP without fine-tuning, focusing on prompt design and aggregation to improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of MAD in face recognition security by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities, avoiding the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Uses CLIP with multiple textual prompts per class, aggregating their embeddings to align the model's representations with MAD tasks.

Result: Prompt aggregation significantly enhances zero-shot MAD detection performance.

Conclusion: Efficient prompt engineering can effectively exploit foundation models' multimodal knowledge for MAD without additional training.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

TL;DR: A lightweight transformer framework for skeleton-based action recognition integrates spatio-temporal modeling in a single module, reducing complexity and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods for skeleton-based action recognition are complex, computationally expensive, and lack scalability due to redundant designs.

Method: Proposes a unified spatio-temporal transformer with a single attention module and a multi-scale pooling fusion module for local and global motion capture.

Result: Achieves 58% fewer parameters and 60% lower computational cost than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The lightweight framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for skeleton-based action recognition without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout-Togglable Storytelling, a method using layout conditions to enhance subject consistency and control in storytelling tasks, supported by a new dataset (Lay2Story-1M) and benchmark (Lay2Story-Bench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with subject consistency and fine-grained control in storytelling due to lack of guidance and high-quality data.

Method: Proposes Lay2Story, a framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and layout conditions for precise subject control.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in consistency, semantic correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: Layout conditions and the proposed framework significantly improve storytelling tasks, supported by new datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset (BrightVQA) and a model (TCSSM) for Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) to address domain shift issues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional change detection methods require expert knowledge, and existing CDVQA methods assume similar training-testing distributions, which is unrealistic due to domain shifts.

Method: Proposes a Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM) that integrates bi-temporal imagery and textual data to extract domain-invariant features, dynamically aligning visual and textual inputs.

Result: TCSSM demonstrates superior performance in experiments compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The work advances CDVQA by addressing domain shift, with the dataset and model made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

TL;DR: TaoCache is a training-free caching strategy for video diffusion models that improves visual quality by predicting noise output from a fixed-point perspective, focusing on late denoising stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-based methods skip early or mid denoising steps, causing structural discrepancies and hindering instruction following and character consistency.

Method: TaoCache uses a fixed-point perspective to predict noise output, calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas to preserve high-resolution structure.

Result: TaoCache achieves higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior methods under the same speedups.

Conclusion: TaoCache is effective for late denoising stages and integrates well with other acceleration techniques, improving visual quality without training.

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using pretrained LLMs for color recommendation in design, introducing ColorGPT, a pipeline that outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colors are vital in design, but traditional methods struggle with complexity and data limitations. The study investigates if LLMs can improve color recommendation.

Method: Developed ColorGPT, a pipeline using LLMs, tested color representations, and applied prompt engineering for palette completion and generation.

Result: ColorGPT outperformed existing methods in accuracy and color distribution for palette completion and improved diversity and similarity in full palette generation.

Conclusion: Pretrained LLMs, like ColorGPT, are superior for color recommendation tasks, offering better performance than traditional methods.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

### [58] [KFFocus: Highlighting Keyframes for Enhanced Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08989)
*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus improves video LLMs by efficiently compressing video tokens and emphasizing keyframes, outperforming existing methods in computational efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video LLMs use uniform sampling for compression, risking omission of keyframes with essential details. KFFocus addresses this by focusing on informative context.

Method: KFFocus replaces uniform sampling with keyframe identification based on temporal redundancy and assigns varying condensation ratios. It includes a spatiotemporal modeling module for nuanced understanding.

Result: KFFocus outperforms existing methods on video understanding benchmarks, especially in long video scenarios, achieving better efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: KFFocus effectively compresses video tokens while preserving critical details, enhancing video LLM performance.

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

*Zan Wang,Jingze Zhang,Yixin Chen,Baoxiong Jia,Wei Liang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSQ introduces a multi-scale quantization method for human motion generation, addressing limitations in capturing complex patterns and compositional flexibility. It outperforms baselines in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion representations lack multi-scale perspective and compositional flexibility, limiting complex pattern modeling and generalization.

Method: MSQ compresses motion sequences into multi-scale discrete tokens using distinct encoders for spatial granularities and temporal interpolation. A generative mask modeling model supports editing, control, and conditional generation.

Result: MSQ enables seamless composition of motion tokens without specialized design or re-training and outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: MSQ effectively addresses limitations in motion representation, offering improved performance and flexibility for diverse generation tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

### [60] [UniConvNet: Expanding Effective Receptive Field while Maintaining Asymptotically Gaussian Distribution for ConvNets of Any Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09000)
*Yuhao Wang,Wei Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UniConvNet, a universal ConvNet model that expands the effective receptive field (ERF) while maintaining its asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) by combining smaller kernels. It outperforms state-of-the-art models on various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ERF in ConvNets is promising but constrained by high computational costs and disrupted AGD. The paper aims to address this by efficiently expanding ERF while preserving AGD.

Method: Introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator and a Layer Operator to expand ERF using smaller kernels (e.g., 7x7, 9x9, 11x11). Proposes UniConvNet, a scalable model for any ConvNet scale.

Result: UniConvNet achieves 84.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 30M parameters and 5.1G FLOPs (UniConvNet-T), and 88.4% with UniConvNet-XL, outperforming CNNs and ViTs.

Conclusion: UniConvNet is a scalable, efficient alternative to large-kernel ConvNets, maintaining AGD while expanding ERF, and excels in vision tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

### [61] [Towards Perfection: Building Inter-component Mutual Correction for Retinex-based Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09009)
*Luyang Cao,Han Xu,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Jiayi Ma,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of inter-component residuals (ICR) in Retinex-based low-light image enhancement and proposes a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to mitigate ICR, improving decomposition and enhancement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based methods struggle with perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components, leaving residuals (ICR) that degrade image quality.

Method: Proposes IRetinex, featuring an inter-component residual reduction module for decomposition and leveraging feature similarity to mitigate ICR during enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior qualitative and quantitative results.

Conclusion: Addressing ICR significantly improves low-light image enhancement, with IRetinex offering a robust solution.

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

*Kaiwen Huang,Tao Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Xiao-Jun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UC-Seg, an uncertainty-aware cross-training framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, addressing cognitive biases and pseudo-label generation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert annotations and address cognitive biases in semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation.

Method: UC-Seg uses two subnets with Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) and Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) to enhance feature representation and generate high-confidence pseudo-labels.

Result: UC-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy and generalization across various medical image modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates biases and improves segmentation performance, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

*Zhiqiang Yang,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Guodong Yang,Chunjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPGNet introduces a dual-path approach to improve deepfake detection by leveraging unlabeled data and addressing domain gaps, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 6.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of deepfakes makes labeling unreliable and time-consuming, necessitating methods to utilize unlabeled data effectively.

Method: DPGNet uses text-guided cross-domain alignment and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, with cross-domain knowledge distillation to prevent forgetting.

Result: DPGNet achieves a 6.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: DPGNet effectively addresses annotation challenges by leveraging unlabeled data and bridging domain gaps, proving robust against realistic deepfakes.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision-Language-Action model integrating spatial and temporal understanding via visual prompting, improving task success rates with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance agent movement prediction by combining spatial and temporal aspects, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Method: Projects visual traces of key points onto depth maps to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal information.

Result: Increases task success by 4% over SpatialVLA and 19% over TraceVLA in SimplerEnv, with minimal training data.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and practical for real-world applications with limited data.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalization step to enhance existing text-to-image methods, using prompt-specific and noise-seed-specific techniques with self- and cross-attention losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual concept learning (text-to-image personalization) by augmenting existing methods with a tailored personalization step for better semantic similarity.

Method: Adds a personalization step using PDM features and two loss terms (self- and cross-attention) to capture concept identity. Evaluated on six personalization methods and multiple base models.

Result: Significant improvements over previous per-query personalization methods, even with UNet- and DiT-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed personalization step effectively enhances existing text-to-image methods, offering better concept identity and semantic similarity.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

*Shanle Yao,Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre,Armin Danesh Pazho,Hamed Tabkhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active learning framework for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) improves adaptability in dynamic environments by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD methods fail in dynamic real-world settings due to static assumptions and inadequate evaluation metrics.

Method: Proposes an active learning framework with human-in-the-loop to refine pseudo-labels and define adaptive thresholds for varying environments.

Result: Achieves an EBI of 68.91 in simulated real-world scenarios, showing practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework enhances VAD's adaptability and applicability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-3D is an end-to-end framework using VLMs for 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving, improving accuracy by 12.8% with a joint semantic-geometric loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of open-set perception in traffic environments by leveraging VLMs' semantic reasoning to identify unseen objects, crucial for safety.

Method: VLM-3D integrates LoRA for efficient VLM adaptation and uses a joint semantic-geometric loss (token-level semantic loss early, 3D IoU loss later) for stable convergence and refined accuracy.

Result: 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: VLM-3D effectively combines VLMs with 3D perception, advancing autonomous driving safety and accuracy.

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling up learned image compression models, revealing performance trends via scaling laws, and demonstrates improved rate-distortion performance with larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression models are limited in scale, and the impact of scaling on performance is unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The study scales the HPCM model from 68.5M to 1B parameters, fits power-law relations between test loss and scaling variables (model size, training compute), and extrapolates trends.

Result: The scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, revealing a scaling trend for future models.

Conclusion: This work inspires further exploration of large-scale compression models and the link between compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to reduce demographic biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for glaucoma screening using unsupervised clustering and weighted contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs exhibit demographic biases even without explicit protected attributes, which is critical in glaucoma screening due to its disproportionate impact on underserved populations.

Method: Attribute-agnostic debiasing via unsupervised clustering, gradient-similarity weighting, and a joint weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters.

Result: Improved equitable performance across inferred demographic subgroups, measured by EOD, ES AUC, and Groupwise AUC.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces subgroup disparities in glaucoma screening without requiring demographic labels.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of facial recognition systems is threatened by advanced spoofing attacks, highlighting the need for more robust liveness detection techniques.

Method: The study introduces deep learning models integrating texture analysis and reflective properties to distinguish genuine traits from replicas.

Result: Extensive testing on diverse datasets shows the best model achieves 99.9% accuracy, outperforming current anti-spoofing methods.

Conclusion: The research advances biometric security, offering a reliable solution against evolving spoofing attacks and enhancing trust in authentication systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large generative AI models face computational bottlenecks on mobile devices due to VAE inefficiencies.

Method: Analyzes VAE redundancy, integrates 3D depthwise separable convolutions, proposes decoupled 3D pixel shuffle, and distills the decoder for mobile adaptation.

Result: Achieves 84.5x speedup, 17.5% parameter count, 96.9% quality retention, and real-time 720p decoding.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED enables efficient mobile deployment of video VAEs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

Result: The category of LLMs is shown to be (co)complete and forms a topos, enabling novel compositional structures for LLM design.

Conclusion: The proposed categorical approach offers a theoretically grounded framework for designing advanced LLM architectures.

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

### [74] [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Topos causal models (TCMs) leverage topos category properties for causal inference, enabling solutions to complex causal diagrams, interventions via subobject classifiers, and reasoning about causal equivalences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing causal models by utilizing the mathematical richness of topos categories for more flexible and powerful causal inference.

Method: Define TCMs using topos properties (completeness, subobject classifiers, exponential objects) and demonstrate their application in solving causal diagrams, interventions, and equivalences.

Result: TCMs provide a framework for solving arbitrary causal diagrams, modeling interventions, and reasoning about causal operations, with proofs of their (co)completeness.

Conclusion: TCMs offer a robust and versatile approach to causal inference, unifying categorical properties with practical applications in causal modeling.

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

*Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro,Dario Landa-Silva,Wasakorn Laesanklang,Ademir Aparecido Constantino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method combining multiobjective algorithms and Goal Programming to efficiently solve similar problem instances by leveraging fitness landscape similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining good approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems, especially when problem instances share similarities in fitness landscapes.

Method: Solve one instance with expensive multiobjective algorithms, then use Goal Programming with efficient single-objective algorithms for similar instances.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows, achieving good results quickly.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively combines multiobjective algorithms and Goal Programming for efficient solution-finding in scenarios with similar fitness landscapes.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to automate Bayesian inference, introducing LLM-BI and demonstrating its feasibility in specifying priors and model structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the barrier of requiring specialized expertise for specifying Bayesian priors and likelihoods.

Method: Introduces LLM-BI, a pipeline for automating Bayesian workflows, tested in two experiments on Bayesian linear regression.

Result: LLMs successfully elicited priors and specified entire model structures from natural language descriptions.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in automating Bayesian modeling, potentially enabling automated probabilistic programming.

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [77] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FATA improves LLM response quality by proactively asking users for supplementary info before answering, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with incomplete user queries; FATA aims to enhance response accuracy by ensuring query completeness and involving users.

Method: FATA guides LLMs to generate supplementary questions upfront, integrates user answers, and uses prompting for better responses.

Result: FATA outperforms baseline by 40% and shows 8% better stability than expert prompts.

Conclusion: FATA effectively improves LLM interactions by ensuring completeness and user participation, offering a more stable and accurate solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Yuan He,Jiaoyan Chen,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current KG-RAG evaluation practices, introduces a new benchmark method, and finds KG-RAG methods lack reasoning under missing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG-RAG benchmarks and evaluation practices are flawed, making it hard to assess true reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces a general benchmark construction method and evaluation protocol to test KG-RAG under knowledge incompleteness.

Result: KG-RAG methods show limited reasoning with missing knowledge, rely on memorization, and vary in generalization.

Conclusion: Improved benchmarks and evaluation are needed to better assess KG-RAG methods' reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

*Timo Bertram*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UrzaGPT, a domain-adapted LLM, improves drafting decisions in Magic: The Gathering, achieving 66.2% accuracy with fine-tuning, showing potential for general drafting AIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models underperform in CCGs like Magic: The Gathering due to partial observability and evolving card sets. UrzaGPT aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Fine-tuned an open-weight LLM (Low-Rank Adaptation) on annotated draft logs to adapt to game expansions and improve drafting decisions.

Result: UrzaGPT achieved 66.2% accuracy with 10,000 steps, outperforming zero-shot LLMs (43% for GPT-4o) but not domain-specific models.

Conclusion: LLMs like UrzaGPT can enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs, though further improvements are needed to match domain-specific models.

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [80] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bilevel MCTS modification and Tree Collapsing to improve node selection efficiency in classical planning, achieving amortized O(1) runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS in classical planning suffers from high node selection time due to large search depths, unlike game tree search where it's negligible.

Method: Introduces a bilevel MCTS with best-first search from leaf nodes and Tree Collapsing to reduce action steps.

Result: Achieves amortized O(1) runtime for node selection, matching traditional queue-based OPEN lists.

Conclusion: The enhancements significantly improve MCTS efficiency in classical planning.

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method to avoid inefficient full enumeration in constraint modelling by using a solver to compute only relevant combinations, speeding up compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches in constraint modelling languages inefficiently generate all combinations of induction variables, even when most are irrelevant.

Method: Uses a solver to compute only the necessary combinations for generating constraints, avoiding full enumeration.

Result: Produces the same model as conventional flattening but with significantly faster compilation.

Conclusion: Improves efficiency in translating high-level models to solver-ready form, especially for large domains with selective preconditions.

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill decouples prefill and decode stages in LLMs to optimize efficiency and accuracy, outperforming pruned models with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs and latency in LLMs, especially for long sequences, due to uniform handling of prefill and decode stages despite their distinct computational profiles.

Method: Proposes OverFill: uses a full model for prefill and switches to a dense pruned model for decode, leveraging parallel processing and sequential token generation.

Result: Outperforms pruned models by 83.2% (3B-to-1B) and 79.2% (8B-to-3B) on benchmarks, matching same-sized models trained from scratch with less data.

Conclusion: OverFill effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in LLM inference, offering a practical solution for deployment challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GRASP-based metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) combines MIP techniques and local search, achieving near-optimal results in real-time routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The TA-TSP models dynamic arc costs in scenarios like warehouse operations, requiring efficient solutions for real-time applications.

Method: Uses GRASP with MIP-based construction and multi-neighborhood local search (2-Opt, Swap, Relocate).

Result: Achieved 0.77% and 0.40% optimality gaps on MESS 2024 instances, outperforming Gurobi by 11.3% on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The method is effective for TA-TSP, ranking top three in MESS 2024, suitable for real-time routing with dynamic costs.

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ordinal preference data for LLM alignment is insufficient; cardinal feedback is needed for optimal model selection. A dataset of 25,000 cardinal judgments was released, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods rely on ordinal preference data, which lacks the granularity to resolve tradeoffs or identify the most preferred model.

Method: Proves the insufficiency of ordinal data, introduces cardinal feedback via willingness-to-pay elicitations, and incorporates it into preference fine-tuning.

Result: Cardinal feedback outperforms ordinal-only methods, enabling prioritization of high-impact improvements and better performance on benchmarks like Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Cardinal feedback is essential for optimal LLM alignment, addressing limitations of ordinal data and improving model performance.

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based models like POMO show promise but have room for improvement, especially in solving combinatorial problems like VRP variants.

Method: Enhanced POMO (POMO+) by using initial nodes to guide solutions more effectively.

Result: POMO+ converges faster and outperforms POMO on the CVRPLIB dataset, particularly for instances with up to 100 customers.

Conclusion: POMO+ advances RL-based combinatorial problem-solving, with potential for further field advancements.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate uncertain ontology alignments, reducing reliance on expensive human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human involvement in ontology alignment is costly, especially for large ontologies, prompting the need for alternatives like LLMs.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs for validating uncertain alignments, using OAEI tasks and ontology-driven prompts, comparing results to simulated Oracles.

Result: LLMs show promise in validating uncertain alignments, with performance analyzed against varying Oracle error rates.

Conclusion: LLMs can feasibly replace human experts in validating uncertain ontology alignments, offering a cost-effective solution.

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities beyond typical benchmarks, focusing on spatial reasoning and planning, and to provide a reproducible testbed for research.

Method: Uses a game description language for rapid game creation, ASCII representations for efficiency, and defines metrics like meaningful step ratio and step efficiency.

Result: LLMs show persistent limitations in spatial reasoning and planning, with partial improvements from structured prompting and spatial grounding.

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM highlights LLMs' shortcomings in complex tasks and serves as a tool for advancing research on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM is a modular framework using LLMs to generate high-quality synthetic medical data with structured prompts, evaluated for statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted access to real medical data due to privacy regulations hinders healthcare research; synthetic data is a promising but challenging alternative.

Method: SynLLM employs 20 open-source LLMs with four prompt types (example-driven to rule-based) to generate synthetic medical data without fine-tuning, and evaluates it using a multi-dimensional framework.

Result: Rule-based prompts achieve the best privacy-quality balance, demonstrating LLMs can produce clinically plausible and privacy-aware synthetic data.

Conclusion: SynLLM enables safer and more effective data sharing in healthcare research by leveraging well-designed prompts and robust evaluation.

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more

*Zhichao Wang,Xinhai Chen,Qinglin Wang,Xiang Gao,Qingyang Zhang,Menghan Jia,Xiang Zhang,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UGM2N is an unsupervised, generalizable mesh movement network for PDEs, enhancing accuracy and efficiency without pre-adapted meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh movement techniques are computationally complex and inflexible, while supervised learning lacks zero-shot generalization.

Method: UGM2N uses localized geometric feature learning and a physics-constrained M-Uniform loss for mesh equidistribution.

Result: UGM2N outperforms existing methods, generalizing across PDEs and mesh geometries, ensuring error reduction and scalability.

Conclusion: UGM2N offers a robust, equation-agnostic solution for efficient mesh adaptation in PDE simulations.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

*Bo Yang,Yu Zhang,Lanfei Feng,Yunkui Chen,Jianyu Zhang,Xiao Xu,Nueraili Aierken,Yurui Li,Yuxuan Chen,Guijun Yang,Yong He,Runhe Huang,Shijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriGPT is a specialized LLM for agriculture, built with a scalable data engine, Tri-RAG framework, and evaluated on AgriBench-13K, outperforming general LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of domain-specific LLMs, datasets, and evaluation frameworks in agriculture.

Method: Develops AgriGPT using a multi-agent data engine (Agri-342K dataset) and Tri-RAG (dense/sparse retrieval + knowledge graph reasoning).

Result: AgriGPT outperforms general-purpose LLMs in domain adaptation and reasoning.

Conclusion: AgriGPT offers a modular, extensible ecosystem for agriculture, promoting open research and empowering underserved regions.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diminution, a subset of the Herbrand universe, reduces grounding size and time in ASP, improving performance by up to 70% in grounding time and 85% in file size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The grounding bottleneck in ASP, caused by large Herbrand universes, necessitates a formal and generalizable strategy to improve grounding performance.

Method: Introduces diminution, a selected subset of the Herbrand universe, with a formal definition and analysis. Uses an encoding for ASP solvers to evaluate subsets and integrates with existing grounders via domain predicates.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show grounding time reduced by up to 70% and grounding file size by up to 85%.

Conclusion: Diminution is a robust and general-purpose solution to the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel personalized, online, and cost-aware feature selection framework for EHR data addresses sparsity and heterogeneity, optimizing resource use in clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting insights from complex EHR data is challenging due to sparsity, heterogeneity, and feature costs, especially for patient-specific variations.

Method: Proposes an online feature selection framework for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and feature variability costs to manage sparse, multimodal data.

Result: The framework ensures robust, scalable performance in healthcare contexts, aiding physicians in incremental feature acquisition for better diagnostics.

Conclusion: The approach enhances diagnostic confidence and resource optimization in patient screening, addressing key EHR data challenges.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt-and-Check, a lightweight method using open-source LLMs to evaluate procedural communication compliance in simulation-based training, tested in the maritime domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate evaluation of compliance in safety-critical domains is crucial for operational competence, but traditional methods may be resource-intensive.

Method: Uses prompt-based inference with LLMs (e.g., LLama 2 7B, Mistral 7B) to assess checklist fulfillment from transcribed verbal exchanges, tested on an RTX 4070 GPU.

Result: Demonstrates that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without task-specific training, achieving good accuracy and agreement with expert annotations.

Conclusion: Highlights the practical utility of LLMs for automated assessment, debriefing, and performance feedback in training environments.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

TL;DR: A hybrid optimization solver combining machine learning (GNNs) and metaheuristics improves performance for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), scaling to large instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance metaheuristic algorithms' performance for CVRP by integrating machine learning to guide node removal strategically.

Method: Proposes a Node-Destroyer Model using GNNs to identify and select nodes for Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) within metaheuristic frameworks, reducing search space complexity.

Result: Improves solution quality for standard benchmarks and scales to large instances (up to 30,000 nodes) without retraining.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively boosts metaheuristic algorithms, offering scalable and high-quality solutions for CVRP.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Result: Outperforms existing models on JEE and other benchmarks, offering step-by-step reasoning.

Conclusion: Aryabhata is released as an open-source foundation model to improve student learning outcomes.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often

*Chen Li,Han Zhang,Zhantao Yang,Fangyi Chen,Zihan Wang,Anudeepsekhar Bolimera,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision improves VLM reasoning by introducing topology-aware training and Frugal Learning, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex tasks and verbose outputs due to reliance on CoT reasoning, needing diverse topological structures.

Method: Uses TopoAug for synthetic data, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to train Qwen2VL models, with Frugal Learning to reduce output length.

Result: Improves accuracy by 9.7% over base model, outperforms larger models on benchmarks, and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision enhances VLM performance and efficiency, with released datasets and code.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

*Yuwei Yan,Jinghua Piao,Xiaochong Lan,Chenyang Shao,Pan Hui,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theory-informed framework for LLM-based social agents improves generalization and realism in social simulations by integrating motivation, action planning, and learning modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent implementations lack a unified framework, limiting generalization and realism in social contexts.

Method: Proposes a framework grounded in Social Cognition Theory with three modules: motivation, action planning, and learning.

Result: Agents achieve 75% lower deviation from real-world data; ablation studies confirm module necessity (1.5-3.2x error increase without them).

Conclusion: The framework enhances flexibility and realism in social agent behaviors, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-augmented AR agent framework to enhance personalized task assistance by leveraging historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR agents lack the ability to handle complex multi-step scenarios due to their inability to retain and reason over long-term user experiences and preferences.

Method: The framework includes four modules: Perception (multimodal sensor processing), Memory (persistent spatiotemporal storage), Spatiotemporal Reasoning (context synthesis), and Actuator (AR communication).

Result: A conceptual framework and implementation roadmap are presented, along with potential applications and use cases.

Conclusion: The work aims to inspire future research for more intelligent AR systems that integrate user history with adaptive, context-aware assistance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys knowledge editing in LLMs, proposing a function-based taxonomy to complement existing mechanism-focused approaches, and evaluates how editing effectiveness varies with knowledge types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing surveys that focus on editing mechanisms but overlook the function of the knowledge being edited, aiming for a more holistic understanding.

Method: Introduces a function-based taxonomy alongside mechanism-based approaches, reviewing how different editing methods apply to various knowledge types (factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, social).

Result: Provides a comprehensive mapping of the knowledge editing landscape, highlighting strengths and limitations of methods, and formalizes the problem.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for function-aware editing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRainsaCK is a reusable software resource for benchmarking explanations in link prediction tasks on Knowledge Graphs, addressing the lack of standard evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The incompleteness of Knowledge Graphs necessitates link prediction, but existing embedding-based methods lack comprehensibility. Explanation methods exist but lack standardized evaluation.

Method: GRainsaCK streamlines benchmarking tasks, from model training to explanation evaluation, using modular and extensible functions.

Result: GRainsaCK provides a standardized evaluation protocol and extensive documentation, enhancing reusability and comparability of explanation methods.

Conclusion: GRainsaCK fills a critical gap in evaluating explanations for link prediction, promoting modularity, extensibility, and reuse.

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent improves multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG) with dynamic planning and efficient execution, outperforming existing methods by 13% accuracy and reducing redundant searches by 37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information in mRAG systems for real-world applications like news analysis.

Method: Proposes E-Agent, featuring a mRAG planner for dynamic tool orchestration and a task executor for optimized workflows, along with the RemPlan benchmark for evaluation.

Result: E-Agent achieves a 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods and reduces redundant searches by 37%.

Conclusion: E-Agent and the RemPlan benchmark advance mRAG systems by enabling dynamic planning and efficient execution, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

*Mustafa Akben,Vinayaka Gude,Haya Ajjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs outperform humans in individual emotion recognition tasks but are surpassed by collective human intelligence. Human-AI collaboration yields the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's emotional intelligence, particularly MLLMs, and compare their emotion recognition abilities with humans.

Method: Evaluated MLLMs using RMET and MRMET, comparing performance against human participants and simulating collective intelligence.

Result: MLLMs outperformed humans individually, but aggregated human decisions surpassed MLLMs. Human-AI collaboration achieved the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: Collective human intelligence and human-AI collaboration are key for effective emotional AI, despite MLLMs' strong individual performance.

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-agent framework (Reasoning Agent and Code Agent) is proposed to reduce cognitive load interference in mathematical reasoning systems, improving accuracy and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent systems handling both reasoning and code tasks impose cognitive load interference, reducing correctness.

Method: A dual-agent hybrid framework: Reasoning Agent for problem decomposition, Code Agent for code tasks. Training combines imitation and reinforcement learning.

Result: The dual-agent design reduces interference, improves reasoning accuracy, and stabilizes coordination.

Conclusion: Decoupling reasoning and coding roles enhances performance in mathematical reasoning systems.

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Implicit Reasoning Safety, a vulnerability in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and presents a dataset (SSUI) to address it. Simple In-Context Learning with SSUI mitigates these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety challenges in LVLMs due to flawed reasoning triggered by benign inputs.

Method: Developed the Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations (SSUI) dataset and used In-Context Learning to test mitigation.

Result: Demonstrated that In-Context Learning with SSUI significantly reduces implicit multimodal threats.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning in LVLMs for safety.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

### [106] [Prospect Theory Fails for LLMs: Revealing Instability of Decision-Making under Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08992)
*Rui Wang,Qihan Lin,Jiayu Liu,Qing Zong,Tianshi Zheng,Weiqi Wang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Prospect Theory applies to LLMs and how epistemic markers influence their decision-making. It proposes a framework and finds PT modeling unreliable for LLMs under linguistic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if Prospect Theory (PT) applies to LLMs and how epistemic markers (e.g., 'maybe') affect their decision-making, given the lack of research in this area.

Method: A three-stage experiment using economic questionnaires, introducing uncertainty via epistemic markers' probability values, and evaluating LLMs' decision-making under PT.

Result: PT modeling for LLMs is not consistently reliable, especially when uncertainty is expressed linguistically.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations of PT for LLMs and the impact of linguistic uncertainty, providing a framework for future research.

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

*Sizhe Yuen,Francisco Gomez Medina,Ting Su,Yali Du,Adam J. Sobey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intrinsic Memory Agents improve multi-agent LLM systems by addressing memory limitations with structured, role-aligned memory templates, showing a 38.6% performance boost and better task outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM systems struggle with memory consistency and role adherence due to context window limits, hindering complex problem-solving.

Method: Introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, using structured, evolving agent-specific memories to maintain role alignment and task focus.

Result: Achieves a 38.6% performance improvement on PDDL and better outcomes in data pipeline design tasks across 5 metrics.

Conclusion: Structured intrinsic memory approaches enhance multi-agent LLM systems for structured planning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

### [108] [Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019)
*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end system using mechanistic interpretability to detect and mitigate biases in LLMs, involving probes to identify biases and steering vectors to correct them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the risk of LLMs perpetuating harmful biases, the paper aims to move beyond traditional opaque methods to a direct, interpretable approach.

Method: The method involves training probes on model activations to detect biases and using steering vectors to adjust outputs in real-time.

Result: Probes identified biases with near-perfect accuracy, and steering vectors successfully reduced biased outputs.

Conclusion: The system offers a robust, interpretable solution for safer and more accountable LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

### [109] [A First Look at Predictability and Explainability of Pre-request Passenger Waiting Time in Ridesharing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09027)
*Jie Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiXGBoost, a feature interaction-based XGBoost model, to predict pre-request passenger waiting time in ridesharing systems, addressing a gap in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-request waiting time prediction is crucial for trip planning and improving user experience, yet it remains understudied compared to post-request prediction.

Method: The study uses a data-driven approach to analyze demand-supply dynamics, followed by feature engineering and the development of FiXGBoost for prediction.

Result: FiXGBoost performs well on a large-scale dataset (30M+ trips), offering high explainability and accurate predictions.

Conclusion: The work advances pre-request waiting time prediction, demonstrating its feasibility and importance for ridesharing systems.

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deep neural network-based predictive maintenance framework for CVCM track circuits detects anomalies early, achieving 99.31% accuracy and ISO-17359 compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of subtle anomalies in CVCM track circuits is crucial to prevent cascading disruptions and improve maintenance planning.

Method: Uses deep neural networks to classify anomalies before they escalate, validated on 10 CVCM failure cases. Includes conformal prediction for uncertainty estimates.

Result: Achieves 99.31% accuracy, detects anomalies within 1% of onset, and provides 99% confidence with consistent coverage.

Conclusion: The scalable and adaptable framework enhances railway operational reliability and can be applied to other track circuits.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

*Shixuan Sun,Siyuan Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Jianjie Huang,Jingzhi Li,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) to attribute generated content in RAG/MRAG systems, addressing provenance issues and privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to reliably attribute outputs in RAG/MRAG systems, undermining accountability for privacy leaks.

Method: SMA uses zero-order optimization for attribution estimation and cross-modal techniques for image-to-text attribution.

Result: SMA enables fine-grained source attribution and membership inference on image retrieval traces.

Conclusion: SMA shifts focus to content sourcing, offering a new perspective for auditing data provenance in generative systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: OpenCUA is an open-source framework for vision-language models (CUAs) that includes annotation tools, a large-scale dataset (AgentNet), and a scalable pipeline, achieving SOTA performance with a 34.8% success rate on OSWorld-Verified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open frameworks for studying CUAs, their capabilities, limitations, and risks, as commercial systems remain closed.

Method: Proposes OpenCUA, featuring an annotation infrastructure, AgentNet dataset, and a scalable pipeline for state-action pairs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: OpenCUA-32B achieves a 34.8% success rate on OSWorld-Verified, surpassing GPT-4o and setting a new SOTA for open-source models.

Conclusion: OpenCUA provides a robust foundation for further CUA research, demonstrating strong performance and generalization across domains.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowseMaster is a scalable framework using a planner-executor agent pair to balance search breadth and reasoning depth, outperforming existing methods in complex information-seeking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with balancing search breadth and reasoning depth due to slow querying and noisy inputs, limiting their effectiveness in information-seeking tasks.

Method: BrowseMaster employs a programmatically augmented planner-executor pair: the planner adapts search strategies, and the executor retrieves concise evidence, enabling coherent reasoning and broad exploration.

Result: BrowseMaster achieves scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh, outperforming open-source and proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: BrowseMaster effectively addresses the limitations of current agents, demonstrating strong performance in complex, reasoning-heavy information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EndoAgent is a memory-guided AI agent for endoscopic image diagnosis, integrating iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection to outperform existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods lack unified coordination for multi-step clinical workflows, and AI agents' potential in endoscopy is underexplored.

Method: EndoAgent uses a dual-memory design for short-term action tracking and long-term experiential learning, integrating expert-designed tools in a unified reasoning loop.

Result: EndoAgent outperforms general and medical multimodal models, demonstrating strong flexibility and reasoning.

Conclusion: EndoAgent advances endoscopic AI by combining memory-guided reasoning with adaptive tool use, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 for annotating financial argument quality, comparing their consistency with human annotations and testing for gender bias. Findings show higher LLM agreement than humans but lingering bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing argument quality in financial communications is understudied, and LLMs' potential for reliable, cost-effective annotation is unexplored.

Method: Uses the FinArgQuality dataset to evaluate LLM annotation consistency and introduces an adversarial attack to test gender bias across temperature settings.

Result: LLMs achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than humans but display gender bias. Temperature settings affect annotation stability.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' promise for annotation but underscores the need for bias mitigation and methodological improvements.

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel council debate method using LLMs for detecting scientific discourse in tweets, excelling in identifying references to scientific studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of scientific claims, references, and entities in tweets through structured LLM debates.

Method: Three debating methods: single debate, team debate, and council debate (the latter chosen for its superior performance).

Result: Ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies but lower for claims and entities.

Conclusion: Council debate is effective for specific tasks like detecting scientific references, though less so for broader categories.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in cognitive empathy but lag in affective empathy, making them effective for objective emotional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate cognitive and affective empathy in language models compared to humans, given their growing role as virtual assistants.

Method: Standardized psychological tests were used to assess cognitive and affective empathy across small and large language models and human participants.

Result: LLMs surpassed humans in cognitive empathy but showed lower affective empathy.

Conclusion: LLMs' high cognitive empathy and low affective empathy make them ideal for consistent, unbiased emotional support without emotional fatigue.

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time method for grouping news articles into stories by combining text representation, clustering, and online topic modeling, evaluated on Slovene media data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance news monitoring systems by automatically organizing articles into topical stories in real time, focusing on specific events, places, and people rather than general text similarity or predefined topics.

Method: Combines text representation techniques, clustering algorithms, and online topic modeling (e.g., BERTopic, DBStream, TextClust) to assign articles to stories as they are published.

Result: The approach produces sensible results on a Slovene news dataset, validated by human evaluators.

Conclusion: The proposed real-time story identification method effectively groups news articles into stories, improving news monitoring systems.

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

TL;DR: TT-XAI improves clinical language models by distilling EHRs into keywords for better classification and interpretability, validated through multiple evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical language models often fail to provide trustworthy predictions and explanations for lengthy EHRs, necessitating a more effective and interpretable solution.

Method: TT-XAI uses domain-aware keyword distillation to enhance BERT classifier performance and employs keyword-guided prompts with LLMs for chain-of-thought explanations.

Result: Evaluations show keyword-augmented methods outperform in fidelity, self-assessment, and human expert review, confirming improved interpretability.

Conclusion: TT-XAI provides a scalable, trustworthy framework for clinical decision support by enhancing both machine and human interpretability.

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward

### [120] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A transparent method called SCBM uses adjectives as interpretable concepts for hate speech detection, outperforming benchmarks and offering high interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of hate speech on social media necessitates automated, interpretable detection methods.

Method: SCBM maps texts to adjective-based representations via LLMs, then uses a lightweight classifier for tasks.

Result: SCBM achieves a 0.69 average macro-F1 score, outperforming benchmarks on 4/5 datasets, with a 1.8% boost when fused with transformer embeddings.

Conclusion: Adjective-based representations are compact, interpretable, and effective for hate speech detection, with potential for broader NLP applications.

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench is a benchmark for evaluating continual instruction tuning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), offering multidimensional evaluation, comprehensive algorithm comparison, and curated tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of rigorous benchmarks for continual instruction tuning in MLLMs hinders progress, prompting the creation of MLLM-CTBench.

Method: The benchmark combines answer accuracy with reasoning quality assessment, evaluates eight continual learning algorithms, and uses 16 datasets across six domains.

Result: Key findings include stronger models resist forgetting, reasoning chains degrade slower, algorithm effectiveness depends on model capability and task order, and KL-divergence constraints aid reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench sets a standard for continual instruction tuning and provides practical guidance for algorithm design.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to identify causally relevant units in LLMs and VLMs for ToM and math tasks, finding unexpected results that challenge the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To pinpoint causally relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning in large language and vision-language models.

Method: Localized top-activated units using contrastive stimulus sets and assessed their causal role via targeted ablations across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs.

Result: Low-activation units sometimes caused larger performance drops than highly activated ones, and math-localizer units impaired ToM performance more than ToM-localizer units.

Conclusion: The findings question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and suggest the need for broader stimulus sets to better identify task-specific units.

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM integrates LLMs with Behavior Trees and Formal Grammars for natural language control of multi-agent systems, improving syntactic validity and task performance via fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural language control of multi-agent systems in user-defined environments, addressing syntactic validity and semantic relevance.

Method: Uses standardized interfaces for environments/agents and introduces two synthetic dataset methods (A and B) to fine-tune LLMs (Gemma 3 family).

Result: Method B achieves 92.6% syntactic validity and 33% task performance improvement; smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MinionsLLM is effective for multi-agent control, especially with compact models, and is released open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

### [125] [The Illusion of Progress: Re-evaluating Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08285)
*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques ROUGE for misaligning with human judgments in hallucination detection, showing performance drops with human-aligned metrics and advocating for semantically aware evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unreliability of ROUGE in evaluating hallucination detection methods in LLMs, which misrepresents true performance.

Method: Conducted human studies comparing ROUGE with human-aligned metrics (e.g., LLM-as-Judge) and analyzed simple heuristics like response length.

Result: ROUGE has high recall but low precision; performance drops up to 45.9% with human-aligned metrics. Simple heuristics rival complex methods.

Conclusion: Semantically aware evaluation frameworks are crucial for accurate hallucination detection and trustworthy LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiqhQA, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' accuracy and abstention behavior in generating Islamic rulings across Sunni schools of thought in Arabic and English. GPT-4o leads in accuracy, while Gemini and Fanar excel in abstention. Performance drops in Arabic, emphasizing language limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reliability in religious domains, particularly Islamic jurisprudence, where accuracy and abstention are critical but understudied.

Method: Zero-shot and abstention experiments on FiqhQA, evaluating LLMs across languages and legal schools of thought.

Result: GPT-4o is most accurate; Gemini and Fanar handle abstention best. Performance declines in Arabic.

Conclusion: Task-specific evaluation and cautious LLM deployment are needed in religious applications due to varying performance and language limitations.

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning, using competition-level problems and variations to avoid contamination. Top models show significant accuracy drops on unseen variations, indicating memorization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs' mathematical reasoning are saturated and contaminated. A dynamic, contamination-resilient benchmark is needed.

Method: Introduces Putnam-AXIOM with 522 competition problems and 100 functional variants. Uses Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA) to evaluate reasoning traces.

Result: Top model scores 41.9% on original problems but drops 19.6% on variations. Other models show similar trends, suggesting memorization.

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM offers a robust, dynamic framework for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning, addressing contamination and memorization issues.

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE framework enhances LLMs for education using Chain-of-Thought data augmentation, improving pedagogical guidance and resistance to premature answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-the-shelf LLMs underperform in educational settings by revealing answers too readily and lacking adaptivity.

Method: CoDAE augments real-world student-tutor dialogues with CoT prompting, fine-tunes LLMs, and evaluates them in simulated scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned models provide better pedagogical guidance, support reasoning, and resist premature answers.

Conclusion: CoDAE effectively adapts LLMs for educational use, addressing key limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mol-R1 improves reasoning in LLMs for molecule discovery by combining curated datasets and iterative training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of Long-CoT reasoning models in knowledge-intensive domains like molecule discovery due to complexity and lack of expert annotations.

Method: Uses PRID for dataset curation and MoIA (iterative SFT + RPO) to enhance reasoning performance.

Result: Mol-R1 outperforms existing baselines in text-based molecule generation.

Conclusion: Mol-R1 effectively bridges the gap in reasoning performance for molecule discovery tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

*Saketh Reddy Vemula,Dipti Mishra Sharma,Parameswari Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether morphologically aligned tokenization improves language model performance, focusing on Telugu, Hindi, and English. Findings show moderate benefits for syntax tasks but highlight tokenizer algorithms as more impactful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting prior findings on morphological alignment's impact on language model performance, especially for morphologically complex languages, prompted this investigation.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of language models, including tokenizer training, finetuning, and downstream tasks, with a focus on morphological alignment and tokenization quality. A dataset of gold morpheme segmentations was created for Telugu.

Result: Better morphological alignment moderately improves syntax-based tasks, but tokenizer algorithms (e.g., BPE vs. Unigram) are more influential. Hybrid tokenizers with morphological segmentation enhance BPE performance.

Conclusion: Morphological alignment has limited impact compared to tokenizer choice, with hybrid approaches offering the best results for BPE-based models.

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: Proposes two lightweight DPO-based variants (Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero) to improve small LLM alignment with human preferences, showing notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small LLMs struggle with aligning outputs to human preferences, especially under performance gaps.

Method: Introduces margin-based objectives (Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss) and selective update mechanisms (APO-hinge-zero).

Result: APO-hinge-zero improves win rates in AlpacaEval (+2.0 points) and MT-Bench, excelling in STEM and Humanities.

Conclusion: Simple modifications to preference-based objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource constraints.

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

*Lorenzo Tomaz,Judd Rosenblatt,Thomas Berry Jones,Diogo Schwerz de Lucena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies hidden state dynamics in large language models, identifying a conserved "energy" quantity. It introduces Jacobian steering for controlled token generation, improving semantic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control the hidden state dynamics of transformers for better interpretability and alignment with human intent.

Method: Analyzed 20 transformer models, introduced a physics-inspired "energy" metric, and derived Jacobian steering for minimal hidden state perturbations.

Result: Found conserved "energy" in models; Jacobian steering improved semantic quality of outputs while maintaining energy.

Conclusion: The physics-based approach offers a principled framework for interpretability, anomaly detection, and safer model steering.

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a steerable pluralistic model for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse user preferences, using few-shot comparative regression and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods like RLHF use scalar rewards, which average user preferences. The paper aims to capture diverse preferences across multiple attributes, not just helpfulness and harmlessness.

Method: Proposes a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative regression, leveraging in-context learning and fine-grained attributes to compare responses. Evaluated using adapted Moral Integrity Corpus and HelpSteer2 datasets.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods, is interpretable, and compatible with various attributes and LLMs.

Conclusion: The work advances pluralistic alignment, enabling fairer and more representative LLM use, and sets new research directions in ethical AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

TL;DR: DeCAL is a tokenwise compression method using a pretrained encoder-decoder model, achieving high-quality compression with minor performance dropoff up to 8x compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general-purpose compression method for dense representations, balancing quality and compute.

Method: Uses a denoising-pretrained encoder-decoder model with encoder modifications to maximize compression quality.

Result: Matches uncompressed performance at 2x compression, with minor dropoff up to 8x in tasks like QA and summarization.

Conclusion: DeCAL provides significant savings for pre-computed representations and has potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

TL;DR: DepressLLM, a large language model, improves depression prediction using autobiographical narratives and achieves high AUC scores, especially for high-confidence samples. It also shows robustness across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets for depression prediction motivates the development of DepressLLM to enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis.

Method: DepressLLM uses autobiographical narratives and a Score-guided Token Probability Summation (SToPS) module for interpretable predictions and reliable confidence estimates.

Result: DepressLLM achieves an AUC of 0.789, rising to 0.904 for high-confidence samples, and demonstrates robustness on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Interpretable AI like DepressLLM holds promise for early depression diagnosis, though limitations highlight areas for future refinement.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

### [136] [Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Colloquial Cantonese: A LoRA-Based Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08610)
*David Santandreu Calonge,Linda Smail*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The review explores Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in handling Cantonese colloquial expressions. It highlights dynamic LoRA adaptations as effective but notes challenges in linguistic nuance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in RAG systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi, which struggle with Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic variability.

Method: Evaluates LoRA integration in RAG, benchmarks PEFT methods, identifies domain adaptation strategies, and compares fine-tuning techniques. Analyzes studies on LoRA variants, synthetic data, user feedback, and adaptive parameter allocation.

Result: Dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations reduce parameters without losing accuracy, but fine-grained linguistic nuances and scalability remain challenges. User feedback integration and domain-specific data are underdeveloped.

Conclusion: PEFT-enhanced RAG systems show promise for domain-specific tasks but need future work on dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable pipelines.

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InternBootcamp is an open-source framework with 1000+ diverse task environments for LLM reasoning research, enabling automated case generation and evaluation. It improves model performance through task scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in domain-specific benchmarks for real-world reasoning scenarios, which require handling diverse and complex environments.

Method: Developed InternBootcamp with automated agent workflows for task generation and manual validation. Includes configurable difficulty levels and verification modules.

Result: Frontier models underperform in many reasoning tasks, but training with InternBootcamp significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Task scaling over two orders of magnitude leads to consistent performance gains, offering a promising path for capable reasoning generalist models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

### [138] [Quick on the Uptake: Eliciting Implicit Intents from Human Demonstrations for Personalized Mobile-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08645)
*Zheng Wu,Heyuan Huang,Yanjia Yang,Yuanyi Song,Xingyu Lou,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Jun Wang,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFRAgent, a framework to improve mobile-use agents by aligning explicit and implicit human intentions, achieving better performance in intention alignment and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mobile-use agents focus only on explicit human intentions (e.g., step sequences), neglecting implicit ones (e.g., preferences), limiting personalization.

Method: Proposes IFRAgent, which analyzes explicit and implicit intention flows from human demonstrations, constructs SOP libraries and habit repositories, and uses retrieval-augmented generation for personalized queries.

Result: IFRAgent outperforms baselines by 6.79% in intention alignment and 5.30% in step completion rates.

Conclusion: IFRAgent enhances mobile-use agents by better aligning with human intentions, improving both personalization and task performance.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

TL;DR: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs, especially Orca~2, outperform state-of-the-art models in ABSA tasks but struggle in zero-shot and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for ABSA, as their performance in such tasks is currently understudied.

Method: Fine-tune open-source LLMs (LLaMA-based) and evaluate them on four ABSA tasks across eight English datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned Orca~2 achieves state-of-the-art results, but models perform poorly in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs excel in ABSA tasks but require further improvement for zero-shot and few-shot learning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their
performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags
behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA
remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting emotions and identifying trigger words in multilingual tweets, leveraging advanced language models.

Method: Fine-tuning quantized large language models (Orca~2) with LoRA and multilingual Transformer models (XLM-R, mT5), enhanced by machine translation and trigger word switching.

Result: Ranked 1st in numerical trigger words, 3rd in binary trigger words, and 7th in emotion detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively tackles cross-lingual emotion and trigger word detection, demonstrating strong performance in the shared task.

Abstract: This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion
Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an
emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five
languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in
binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning
quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters
(LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5. We
enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent
performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary
trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of prompt-based methods for sentiment analysis in Czech, particularly for aspect-based tasks and limited training data scenarios.

Method: Uses sequence-to-sequence models with prompt-based approaches for aspect-based sentiment analysis and sentiment classification, comparing them to traditional fine-tuning.

Result: Prompt-based methods outperform traditional fine-tuning, especially in zero-shot and few-shot learning, and pre-training on target domain data improves zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Prompt-based approaches are superior for sentiment analysis in Czech, particularly with limited data, and domain-specific pre-training enhances zero-shot results.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first prompt-based methods for aspect-based
sentiment analysis and sentiment classification in Czech. We employ the
sequence-to-sequence models to solve the aspect-based tasks simultaneously and
demonstrate the superiority of our prompt-based approach over traditional
fine-tuning. In addition, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot learning
experiments for sentiment classification and show that prompting yields
significantly better results with limited training examples compared to
traditional fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that pre-training on data from the
target domain can lead to significant improvements in a zero-shot scenario.

*Rajmohan C,Sarthak Harne,Arvind Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation using task decomposition and iterative self-feedback achieves strong results on complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous/domain-specific data, table structure, long inputs, and numerical reasoning in text-to-table tasks.

Method: Proposes breaking tasks into guided sub-tasks and refining tables via iterative self-feedback.

Result: Outperforms baselines on two public text-to-table datasets.

Conclusion: Task decomposition and self-feedback improve table generation, though trade-offs exist between performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

*Armel Zebaze,Benoît Sagot,Rachel Bawden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopXGen improves LLM translation for low-resource languages by generating high-quality, diverse target-side texts for backtranslation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the performance gap of LLMs in translating low-resource languages due to limited parallel datasets.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate high-quality, topic-diverse target-side texts in low-resource languages, which are then backtranslated.

Result: Boosts LLM translation performance in fine-tuning and in-context learning.

Conclusion: TopXGen effectively enhances LLM-based translation for low-resource languages by leveraging synthetic data generation.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates ASR models for older Dutch adults using a chatbot, finding generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned ones, with truncation balancing accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of reliable ASR for underrepresented groups like older adults in clinical contexts.

Method: Benchmarked generic multilingual ASR models and fine-tuned models for Dutch spoken by older adults, evaluating accuracy and processing speed.

Result: Generic multilingual models outperformed fine-tuned ones, showing good generalization. Truncation helped balance accuracy and speed, though some cases had high WER due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: Recent ASR models generalize well without fine-tuning, and architectural truncation can optimize performance, but hallucinations remain a challenge.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey of parallel text generation methods to address the speed limitations of autoregressive LLMs, categorizing approaches and analyzing their trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive generation in LLMs is slow due to sequential token production, prompting exploration of parallel techniques for efficiency.

Method: Systematic categorization of parallel text generation into AR-based and Non-AR-based methods, with analysis of their techniques, trade-offs, and potential combinations.

Result: Identifies core techniques, assesses speed, quality, and efficiency trade-offs, and compares with alternative acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: Highlights advancements, open challenges, and future research directions in parallel text generation.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

*Yuzhuo Bai,Shitong Duan,Muhua Huang,Jing Yao,Zhenghao Liu,Peng Zhang,Tun Lu,Xiaoyuan Yi,Maosong Sun,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IROTE is a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait elicitation in LLMs, addressing superficial mimicry by optimizing self-reflection prompts based on psychological theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trait elicitation in LLMs are superficial and unstable, failing to consistently embody desired traits across tasks.

Method: IROTE generates and optimizes textual self-reflection prompts using an information-theoretic objective to enhance trait-driven behavior without fine-tuning.

Result: IROTE outperforms baselines, enabling stable impersonation of target traits across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: IROTE effectively addresses the superficial elicitation problem, offering a robust method for trait-driven behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture, improves semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA struggles with semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets.

Method: Proposes Magical: asymmetric LoRA with shared matrix A for summarization, isolated matrices B for diverse styles, Semantic Invariance Constraint, and Recommendation-guided Switch.

Result: Magical outperforms prompt-based methods and LoRA variants, reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: Magical effectively addresses LoRA's limitations in MLLG, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature question answering is crucial for discoveries, but existing RAG-LLMs lack exploration of reranker potential and limitations.

Method: Developed SciRerankBench with three Q-C-A pair types (NC, SSLI, CC) to evaluate 13 rerankers across five LLMs.

Result: Systematic evaluation provides insights into reranker strengths and limitations in scientific contexts.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench is the first benchmark for rerankers in RAG-LLMs, offering guidance for future development.

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual translation of unstructured dialogue into structured artifacts is a bottleneck in IT project governance, necessitating automation.

Method: DevNous integrates into chat environments, identifies actionable intents, and manages workflows for tasks like task formalization and progress summaries.

Result: DevNous achieves 81.3% exact match accuracy and a 0.845 F1-Score on a 160-turn benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The work contributes a validated architectural pattern for administrative agents and a public benchmark for the domain.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARoG, a privacy-protected RAG framework, to address challenges of leveraging private KGs in LLMs while preventing privacy leaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face issues like hallucinations and outdated knowledge. RAG integrates external knowledge but risks privacy when using private KGs due to LLMs' black-box nature and insecure data transmission.

Method: Proposes ARoG with two strategies: (1) relation-centric abstraction to convert anonymous entities into retrievable info, and (2) structure-oriented abstraction to align questions with abstracted KG concepts.

Result: ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness on three datasets.

Conclusion: ARoG effectively enables privacy-protected RAG by addressing retrieval challenges while safeguarding KG entity semantics.

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

TL;DR: Proposes an automated pipeline for constructing training environments and a verifiable reward mechanism to enhance LLMs' tool-use performance via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of efficient RL frameworks for tool use in LLMs due to challenges in stable training environments and reward design.

Method: Introduces an automated environment construction pipeline (scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, localized deployment) and a verifiable reward mechanism.

Result: Significantly improves LLMs' tool-use performance without degrading general capabilities, attributed to better context understanding and reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances LLMs' tool-use abilities, driven by updates to lower-layer MLP parameters.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

*Robin Faro,Dongyang Fan,Tamar Alphaidze,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Experts, addresses temporal leakage in LLMs by training experts on disjoint time slices and masking future-knowledge experts during inference, ensuring causal validity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent LLMs from relying on outdated or future information, ensuring predictions are chronologically grounded.

Method: Pre-train GPT-style experts on disjoint two-year time slices (2013-2024) and combine them using TiMoE, which masks experts with future knowledge during inference.

Result: TiMoE matches or exceeds single-period expert performance and reduces future-knowledge errors by up to 15%.

Conclusion: Modular, time-segmented pre-training with causal routing effectively grounds LLMs temporally without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code

*Yuren Hao,Xiang Wan,Chengxiang Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for assessing LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by testing them on linguistically and parametrically varied, mathematically equivalent problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to non-mathematical perturbations and improve understanding of their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created PutnamGAP, a benchmark dataset with varied math problems, and tested 18 LLMs on it.

Result: Performance dropped significantly on variants; OpenAI's O3 model saw a 4-10.5 percentage point decline.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively evaluates LLMs' robustness and provides insights for enhancing their mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to probe and mitigate ideological biases in decoder-based LLMs by analyzing internal model representations, using the Political Compass Test and contrastive pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs encoding and reproducing ideological biases, especially in political and economic contexts, drive the need for deeper analysis and mitigation methods.

Method: The framework uses contrastive pairs to analyze hidden layer activations in models like Mistral and DeepSeek, with a pipeline for layer-wise ideological bias extraction.

Result: Decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be mitigated using steering vectors.

Conclusion: The work offers insights into political bias encoding in LLMs and a principled debiasing approach beyond surface-level fixes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasGym is a framework for injecting, analyzing, and mitigating biases in LLMs, using BiasInject for bias injection and BiasScope for identification and mitigation, showing effectiveness in real-world and fictional scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating subtle biases in LLMs is challenging, requiring systematic analysis and debiasing methods.

Method: BiasGym uses BiasInject to inject biases via token-based fine-tuning and BiasScope to identify and mitigate biased behavior.

Result: The framework effectively reduces real-world stereotypes and probes fictional associations without degrading downstream task performance.

Conclusion: BiasGym is a versatile tool for bias analysis and mitigation in LLMs, useful for safety and interpretability research.

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

*Kaiyu Wang,Lin Mu,Zhiyao Yang,Ximing Li,Xiaotang Zhou Wanfu Gao,Huimao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Sqator, a span-level QA evaluator for radiology reports, to automate QA scoring by analyzing fine-grained text spans, reducing labor costs and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual QA scoring for radiology reports is labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies due to biases and senior doctors' abilities.

Method: Sqator measures QA scores by analyzing the importance of revised spans between junior and senior reports, merging scores for final output.

Result: Sqator achieves competitive QA scores on 12,013 radiology reports, with revised span importance aligning with senior doctors' judgments.

Conclusion: Sqator offers an efficient and accurate automated solution for QA scoring in radiology reports, addressing labor and bias issues.

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Culturescope, a method to analyze cultural biases in LLMs by probing their internal representations, revealing Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs' internal mechanisms lead to cultural misrepresentation, addressing gaps in prior extrinsic evaluations.

Method: Proposes Culturescope, a mechanistic interpretability-based method using patching to extract cultural knowledge and introduces a cultural flattening score.

Result: LLMs exhibit Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, with low-resource cultures less affected due to limited training data.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for mitigating cultural biases and improving LLMs' cultural understanding, with publicly available codes and data.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

TL;DR: ASPD introduces adaptive serial-parallel decoding to improve LLM inference speed by leveraging intrinsic parallelism in autoregressive models, achieving up to 3.19x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inference latency challenges in large language models (LLMs) caused by their sequential autoregressive decoding.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), including a pipeline for extracting parallelizable structures and a Hybrid Decoding Engine for efficient transitions between serial and parallel modes.

Result: Achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) on Vicuna Bench with response quality maintained within 1% difference.

Conclusion: ASPD sets a benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, enabling deployment in latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

TL;DR: A scalable training pipeline combining weakly supervised learning and supervised fine-tuning achieves state-of-the-art Arabic ASR results, addressing data scarcity and dialect diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate ASR for low-resource languages like Arabic is challenging due to limited labeled data and dialectal complexity.

Method: Pretrain on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech (MSA and DA), then fine-tune with filtered weak labels and a small high-quality dataset.

Result: Ranked first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Weak supervision with fine-tuning overcomes data scarcity and improves ASR for dialect-rich, low-resource languages.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: To assess the performance of language models on multi-step reasoning in low-resource languages like Bangla, beyond high-resource languages such as English.

Method: Manually translated a Bangla reasoning dataset from English, evaluated English-centric and Bangla-centric models on both datasets, and analyzed reasoning step utilization.

Result: Models benefit from reasoning context for non-binary questions but struggle with Bangla reasoning steps, showing varied trends across models and languages.

Conclusion: Reasoning steps impact predictions differently across languages, highlighting the need for improved multilingual reasoning capabilities in models.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning in LLMs, using GRPO to gradually tighten token budgets, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed-length training budgets don't leverage the natural learning progression from exploration to compression, limiting efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Proposes curriculum learning with GRPO, starting with generous token budgets and gradually tightening them, balanced by a reward function for correctness, efficiency, and formatting.

Result: Outperforms fixed-budget baselines in accuracy and token efficiency across multiple datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, etc.).

Conclusion: Progressive constraint via curriculum learning enhances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT is a method for jointly generating and faithfully attributing answers in RAG by leveraging token logits, outperforming state-of-the-art models in trustworthiness benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLM hallucination and improving faithfulness in answer attribution by aligning token generation with attribution generation.

Method: LoDIT marks documents with token identifiers, uses their logits to estimate document contributions, and aggregates these into attributions.

Result: LoDIT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on Trust-Align benchmark and shows efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: LoDIT effectively improves faithfulness and efficiency in attributed text generation, enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

*Seonghwan Choi,Beomseok Kang,Dongwon Jo,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetroAttention improves KV cache efficiency in LLMs by revising past attention outputs with new data, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of KV cache in long-context tasks due to linear memory growth and cumulative attention errors.

Method: Introduces RetroAttention, a technique to update KV cache retrospectively using new decoding step data, maintaining a lightweight output cache.

Result: Increases effective KV exposure by 1.6× and accuracy by 21.9% in benchmarks.

Conclusion: RetroAttention offers a superior solution for KV cache compression in long-generation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Motivation: To explore zero-shot code generation for Tabular QA, avoiding the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Modular pipeline with a code generator, column relevance identification, data type analysis, and iterative refinement for failed code.

Result: Ranked 33 out of 53 in the test phase, demonstrating zero-shot code generation's viability for Tabular QA.

Conclusion: Zero-shot code generation is a valid approach for Tabular QA, with potential for improvement through iterative refinement.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: This paper reviews training-free (TF) alignment methods for large language models (LLMs), categorizing them into pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding stages, and discusses their mechanisms, limitations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional fine-tuning (FT) alignment methods, such as resource intensity and knowledge degradation, by exploring TF alternatives that are adaptable and efficient.

Method: Systematic review of TF alignment techniques, categorized by pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding stages, with analysis of mechanisms and limitations for LLMs and MLLMs.

Result: Identifies key challenges and future directions for TF alignment, providing a structured overview of current research.

Conclusion: The survey offers guidance for practitioners and promotes the development of safer, more reliable LLMs through inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more

### [166] [LLM-as-a-Supervisor: Mistaken Therapeutic Behaviors Trigger Targeted Supervisory Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09042)
*Chen Xu,Zhenyu Lv,Tian Lan,Xianyang Wang,Luyao Ji,Leyang Cui,Minqiang Yang,Jian Shen,Qunxi Dong,Xiuling Liu,Juan Wang,Bin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs as supervisors to train therapists by identifying common mistakes and providing targeted feedback, avoiding direct patient-facing use due to ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and safety concerns prevent direct use of LLMs in psychotherapy, but they can be repurposed to train therapists by focusing on identifiable mistakes.

Method: Develop a training paradigm: (1) define mistake guidelines, (2) create a human-in-the-loop dataset with mistake-prone and supervisor agents, (3) fine-tune a supervisor model for therapist training.

Result: The MATE dataset fine-tuned model provides high-quality feedback aligned with clinical guidelines, proving effective for therapist training.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively supervise therapist training by focusing on mistake correction, offering a safer and ethical alternative to direct patient interaction.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

*Zeyu Huang,Juyuan Wang,Longfeng Chen,Boyi Xiao,Leng Cai,Yawen Zeng,Jin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVISU-Bench is a bilingual benchmark for mobile agents, addressing real-world user needs with 404 tasks across 137 apps. Aider, a plug-and-play module, improves success rates by 19.55%, especially for unethical and interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for mobile agents lack real-world relevance and fail to address diverse user requirements, necessitating a more practical evaluation framework.

Method: Developed MVISU-Bench with 404 tasks across 137 apps, identified from user questionnaires. Introduced Aider, a dynamic prompt prompter, to enhance mobile agent performance.

Result: Aider improved overall success rates by 19.55%, with significant gains in unethical (53.52%) and interactive (29.41%) tasks.

Conclusion: The study reveals a gap between current mobile agents and real-world user expectations, emphasizing the need for practical benchmarks like MVISU-Bench and tools like Aider.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

*Maxim Divilkovskiy,Vitaly Malygin,Sergey Zlobin,Sultan Isali,Vasily Kalugin,Stanislav Ilyushin,Nuriza Aitassova,Yi Fei,Zeng Weidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: READER is a novel speculative decoding method for LLMs that leverages self-repetitions and statistical search to enhance inference speed without additional training, achieving over 40% speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sequential nature of LLM inference is slow and hard to accelerate, especially for large batch sizes, which are crucial for industrial applications.

Method: READER uses retrieval-assisted speculative decoding, expanding the decoding tree with tokens from statistical search and optimizing KV cache size for large batches.

Result: READER outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% speedup and 10x speedup in retrieval-augmented tasks, with no extra training required.

Conclusion: READER is a highly efficient, lossless speculative decoding method for LLMs, particularly effective for large batches and search-based tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

### [169] [CPO: Addressing Reward Ambiguity in Role-playing Dialogue via Comparative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09074)
*Xinge Ye,Rui Wang,Yuchuan Wu,Victor Ma,Feiteng Fang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO) and CharacterArena to address challenges in RLFT for subjective tasks like role-playing dialogue, improving evaluation robustness and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward modeling struggles with subjective tasks due to unclear criteria and unstable rewards. Human evaluation combines explicit and implicit judgments, inspiring CPO.

Method: CPO shifts from sample-wise to group-wise comparative scoring. CharacterArena includes multi-turn simulation and trajectory-level comparative evaluation.

Result: CPO reduces reward ambiguity and improves dialogue quality, validated on CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena.

Conclusion: CPO and CharacterArena enhance RLFT for subjective tasks by leveraging comparative evaluation, offering more robust and fair performance assessment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

### [170] [Utilizing Multilingual Encoders to Improve Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09091)
*Imalsha Puranegedara,Themira Chathumina,Nisal Ranathunga,Nisansa de Silva,Surangika Ranathunga,Mokanarangan Thayaparan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel architecture improves multilingual LLM performance by fusing all intermediate layers of multilingual encoders, outperforming baselines on low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on low-resource languages due to English-centric training, necessitating better alignment methods.

Method: Proposes fusing all intermediate layers with Global Softmax and Transformer Softmax strategies, trained only on English data.

Result: Significant improvements in low-resource languages, e.g., Sinhala accuracy rose from 71.66% to 75.86%, and overall XNLI accuracy increased.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, data-efficient solution for enhancing multilingual LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

*Anastasia Zhukova,Thomas Walton,Christian E. Matt,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a record linking (RL) model for fragmented event logs in the process industry, using cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) enhanced with NLI and STS, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented event logs in shift books hinder knowledge management (KM) by disconnecting related records, making it difficult to recommend solutions.

Method: The study adapts CDCR, traditionally used in news, into an RL model for the process industry, incorporating NLI and STS for causal inference.

Result: The RL model outperformed NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% and 27%, respectively.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation of CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning, effectively improves data quality and connectivity in shift logs for the process industry.

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

TL;DR: AutoCodeGen automates multilingual code generation dataset creation, addressing manual annotation and language bias issues. AutoCodeBench evaluates LLMs on diverse, high-difficulty tasks, revealing their struggles with complexity and multilingualism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM code generation are limited by manual annotations, Python bias, and uneven language distribution. AutoCodeGen aims to overcome these by automating dataset creation.

Method: AutoCodeGen uses LLMs to generate test inputs, a multilingual sandbox for outputs, and employs reverse-order problem generation with filtering to ensure quality. AutoCodeBench is created with 3,920 problems across 20 languages.

Result: Evaluation of 30+ LLMs on AutoCodeBench shows difficulties with task complexity, diversity, and multilingualism. AutoCodeBench-Complete is introduced for few-shot capability assessment.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench provides a scalable, high-quality benchmark for multilingual code generation, highlighting LLM limitations and encouraging focus on practical, challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

TL;DR: Extending Llama-3-8B for Sinhala, SinLlama outperforms base models in text classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Sinhala are underserved by open-source LLMs.

Method: Enhanced tokenizer with Sinhala vocabulary and continual pre-training on a 10M Sinhala corpus.

Result: SinLlama outperforms base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B in text classification.

Conclusion: SinLlama is the first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support, showing significant improvement.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

*Weixuan Wang,Dongge Han,Daniel Madrigal Diaz,Jin Xu,Victor Rühle,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OdysseyBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows in office applications, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks focused on atomic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture long-term dependencies and multi-interaction coordination in real-world scenarios, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation tool.

Method: OdysseyBench includes two splits: OdysseyBench+ (300 real-world tasks) and OdysseyBench-Neo (302 synthesized complex tasks). HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework, automates benchmark generation.

Result: OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing a more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex contexts.

Conclusion: OdysseyBench is a valuable resource for advancing LLM agent development and evaluation in real-world productivity scenarios, with the benchmark and framework released for research.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow logic-rich instructions, showing current models struggle with such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well LLMs handle intricate logic structures in instructions, a gap in current research.

Method: Proposes LogicIFGen for generating verifiable logic-rich instructions from code functions and LogicIFEval, a benchmark with 426 such instructions.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly, correctly following fewer than 60% of instructions.

Conclusion: Highlights significant deficiencies in LLMs' instruction-following ability for logic-rich tasks.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to exploit temporal consistency in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to improve text generation by addressing the issue of temporal oscillation, where correct answers are overwritten in later steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding strategies in dLLMs discard intermediate predictions, missing correct answers that appear mid-process. The paper aims to leverage these overlooked temporal dynamics.

Method: Two methods are proposed: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting (training-free, aggregates predictions across steps) and 2) Temporal Consistency Reinforcement (post-training, uses Temporal Semantic Entropy as a reward signal).

Result: Significant improvements are observed: 24.7% on Countdown with TSE reward alone, and combined gains of 2.0% (GSM8K), 4.3% (MATH500), 6.6% (SVAMP), and 25.3% (Countdown).

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and provides effective tools to utilize them, improving generation stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs effectively convert historical land patent descriptions into accurate coordinates, outperforming traditional methods and offering cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of spatial analysis due to narrative land patent descriptions by leveraging LLMs for georeferencing.

Method: Evaluated six OpenAI models across architectures using direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented approaches, compared with baselines like GIS analysts and geoparsers.

Result: Top model achieved a mean error of 23 km, outperforming baselines by up to 70%, with cost-efficient options available.

Conclusion: LLMs are scalable, accurate, and cost-effective for historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical AI struggles with understanding complex medical concepts and text-image relationships due to reliance on foundation LLMs and limited training data.

Method: Doctor Sun combines a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM, using two-stage training (feature alignment and instruction tuning) on diverse medical datasets.

Result: The model is released alongside SunMed-VL, a bilingual medical multimodal dataset, to support biomedical research.

Conclusion: Doctor Sun advances biomedical multimodal AI by improving data integration and interpretation, with open resources for further development.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hat-DFed, a decentralized federated learning framework for edge computing, optimizing topology and energy efficiency while addressing data and resource heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome communication bottlenecks and inefficiencies in decentralized federated learning (DFL) caused by dynamic topology changes, resource heterogeneity, and data heterogeneity in edge environments.

Method: Formulates topology construction as a dual optimization problem (NP-hard), designs a two-phase algorithm for dynamic topology optimization, and includes an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism.

Result: Hat-DFed maximizes model performance and minimizes energy consumption in complex edge environments, mitigating performance degradation from data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Hat-DFed effectively addresses challenges in DFL for edge computing, offering a practical solution for efficient and scalable federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

*Ziqi Wang,Hailiang Zhao,Cheng Bao,Wenzhuo Qian,Yuhao Yang,Xueqiang Sun,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XFMNet is a multimodal fusion network for water quality prediction, integrating remote sensing and adaptive decomposition to handle temporal and spatial dynamics, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water quality prediction is challenging due to complex periodicity, nonstationarity, and spatial dynamics, especially in multi-site scenarios.

Method: XFMNet uses adaptive downsampling, locally adaptive decomposition, and cross-attention gated fusion to integrate temporal, spatial, and ecological data.

Result: XFMNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: XFMNet effectively addresses challenges in water quality forecasting by combining temporal and spatial data, proving robust for multi-site prediction.

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

*Seonyoung Kim,Dongil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSSDA is a novel two-step SSDA framework for time-series classification, using a domain-invariant encoder and mixup-enhanced contrastive learning to achieve robust performance under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in deep learning models due to domain shift, especially in time-series data, by leveraging limited labeled target domain data.

Method: Proposes MoSSDA: a two-step framework with a domain-invariant encoder and a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module using a momentum encoder, trained without data augmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six datasets, validated with three backbones and varying unlabeled ratios.

Conclusion: MoSSDA effectively handles domain shift in time-series data, with each module contributing to improved performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

*Ningning Fu,Shengheng Liu,Weiliang Xie,Yongming Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGSTC is an online cellular traffic prediction method using multi-grained spatial-temporal features to address concept drift and improve accuracy in continuous forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current telecom data analysis relies on manual intervention and overlooks sporadic, bursty traffic characteristics and concept drift, limiting forecasting accuracy.

Method: MGSTC segments historical data, uses coarse-grained temporal attention for trend reference, and fine-grained spatial attention for detailed correlations, with an online learning strategy for real-time concept drift detection.

Result: MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MGSTC effectively addresses concept drift and improves cellular traffic prediction accuracy in continuous forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets transformer attention as Pavlovian conditioning, linking queries, keys, and values to classical conditioning elements, and provides theoretical insights on capacity, error propagation, and biological learning rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the computational principles behind transformer success by drawing parallels to Pavlovian conditioning.

Method: Theoretical framework mapping attention mechanisms to classical conditioning, analyzing linear attention and associative memory formation via Hebbian rules.

Result: Derived a capacity theorem, error propagation analysis, and insights into biologically plausible learning rules for transformers.

Conclusion: Transformer success may stem from implementing biologically optimized computational principles, not just architectural novelty.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

*Joshua R. Tempelman,Kevin Mitchell,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-conditioned generative model is introduced for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification, improving interpretability and avoiding bias by using probabilistic latent-variable modeling and physics-based conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning frameworks for HSI target identification are limited in interpretability and rely on predefined training libraries, restricting their applicability.

Method: The approach uses a physics-conditioned generative model with probabilistic latent variables, incorporating atmospheric and background estimates as conditioning. It employs in-the-loop augmentation and physics-based loss criteria for unbiased, physically consistent mappings.

Result: The model produces emissivity distributions with interpretable uncertainty quantification and enables distribution-based material matching, providing likely material matches for inferred spectra.

Conclusion: This method enhances HSI target identification by incorporating contextual information, capturing material variation, and offering interpretable probability measures for candidate materials.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

TL;DR: DAMP, a recurrent convolutional network with MLP-based channel mixing, outperforms DARC in generalization, suggesting MLPs enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how channel-wise mixing via MLPs improves generalization in recurrent convolutional networks.

Method: Compare DARC (simple recurrent convolutional) and DAMP (DARC with gated MLP) using the Re-ARC benchmark.

Result: DAMP outperforms DARC in in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: MLP-based channel mixing enhances robustness, making DAMP promising for neural program synthesis and hypernetworks.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an open-source benchmark for evaluating and comparing numerical methods in γ-ray spectrometry, comparing state-of-the-art machine learning with statistical unmixing. The statistical approach outperforms machine learning in identification but is sensitive to poorly modeled spectral signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of common benchmarks for evaluating numerical methods in γ-ray spectrometry makes comparison difficult, prompting the creation of an open-source benchmark.

Method: The study uses simulated datasets, codes of different analysis approaches, and evaluation metrics to compare machine learning and statistical unmixing under three scenarios: known, deformed, and shifted spectral signatures.

Result: The statistical approach consistently outperforms machine learning in identification but is less robust to poorly modeled signatures. Machine learning is a viable alternative under uncertain conditions. Quantification is more accurate with the statistical approach.

Conclusion: The statistical approach is best for known or well-modeled spectral signatures, while machine learning is suitable for uncertain conditions. The benchmark facilitates future comparisons.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

TL;DR: HSA-Net addresses the global-local trade-off in molecular representation learning by combining cross-attention and Graph-Mamba projectors hierarchically, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from over-smoothing in deep layers, and existing methods fail to balance global and local feature preservation.

Method: Proposes HSA-Net with Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) for layer-specific feature projection and Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) for adaptive feature merging.

Result: HSA-Net outperforms SOTA methods in molecular representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: HSA-Net effectively resolves the global-local trade-off, enhancing feature quality for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL integrates split learning and hierarchical FL to reduce communication costs and coordination complexity, improving scalability and efficiency in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL frameworks ignore computational heterogeneity and resource limitations, leading to high communication costs and complex model aggregation.

Method: SHeRL-FL combines split learning and hierarchical model aggregation with representation learning at intermediate layers, enabling independent computation by clients and edge servers.

Result: Experiments show SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by over 90% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50% compared to SplitFed, while improving performance.

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL effectively addresses FL challenges by reducing communication overhead and coordination complexity, making it scalable and efficient for resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [190] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a variant of Tsetlin Machines with fuzzy clause evaluation, reducing clauses, memory, and training time while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strict 'all-or-nothing' clause evaluation in Tsetlin Machines requires excessive clauses for accuracy, prompting the need for a more flexible approach.

Method: FPTM employs fuzzy clause evaluation, allowing partial contributions from literals, enabling adaptive sub-patterns and efficient pattern matching.

Result: FPTM achieves significant improvements: 50x fewer clauses, 316x faster training, and higher accuracy on datasets like IMDb and Fashion-MNIST.

Conclusion: FPTM offers a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional Tsetlin Machines, with superior performance in accuracy, speed, and resource usage.

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

*Elon Litman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper justifies the scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism from first principles, linking it to Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) and revealing its forward pass as an optimal inference and backward pass as a manifold-aware learning update.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled mathematical foundation for SDPA, often heuristically motivated, by connecting it to EOT and reinforcement learning.

Method: The forward pass is shown as solving a degenerate EOT problem, while the backward pass is proven equivalent to an advantage-based policy gradient. The Fisher Information Matrix characterizes the geometry of attention distributions.

Result: SDPA's forward pass is optimal inference, and its backward pass is a natural, variance-reduced learning update due to the EOT-induced geometry.

Conclusion: SDPA is a principled mechanism combining optimal inference and rational learning, unified by its EOT foundation and information geometry.

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of FWPs as a novel approach in machine learning, bridging artificial intelligence with biological neural processes.

Method: Review of FWPs' technical foundations, computational characteristics, and comparisons with transformers and state space models.

Result: FWPs demonstrate dynamic weight adaptation and short-term memory capabilities, with parallels to brain synaptic plasticity.

Conclusion: FWPs offer a promising convergence of artificial and natural intelligence, with implications for future AI and neuroscience research.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF provides a scalable, theoretically sound solution for nonlinear cyclic causal discovery with confounders, validated by experiments and consistency guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

TL;DR: A novel method combining 3D U-Net and Bat Algorithm for liver tumor segmentation in CT images, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver cancer's high lethality necessitates early detection, requiring precise and automated segmentation methods.

Method: Integrates 3D U-Net with Bat Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization (e.g., learning rate, batch size).

Result: Achieves high F1-score at lower thresholds, balancing precision and recall, crucial for clinical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Synergy of deep learning and metaheuristic optimization offers effective solutions for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

*Pallabee Das,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiGNNExplainer is a model-level explanation method for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) that synthesizes realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion, addressing gaps in existing post-hoc explanation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HGNN explanation methods lack support for realistic node features and fail to generate faithful explanations, limiting their practical utility.

Method: DiGNNExplainer uses discrete denoising diffusion to synthesize heterogeneous graphs with realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words) in a discrete space, unlike previous continuous-space approaches.

Result: DiGNNExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing realistic and faithful explanations for HGNN predictions.

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer effectively addresses the limitations of current HGNN explanation methods, offering improved realism and faithfulness in generated explanations.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Khang Tran,Khoa Nguyen,Anh Nguyen,Thong Huynh,Son Pham,Sy-Hoang Nguyen-Dang,Manh Pham,Bang Vo,Mai Ngoc Tran,Mai Ngoc Tran,Dung Luong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quadratic Regularized Partial Optimal Transport (QPOT) as a sparsity-inducing alternative to entropic POT, addressing limitations in real-world ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POT solvers use entropic regularization, leading to dense transport plans, which are unsuitable for applications requiring sparsity.

Method: Proposes QPOT, a novel formulation with quadratic regularization to induce sparsity in transport plans.

Result: Experiments on synthetic, CIFAR-10, and real-world tasks (color transfer, domain adaptation) show improved sparsity and performance.

Conclusion: QPOT offers a viable, sparsity-friendly alternative to entropic POT, enhancing its applicability in ML.

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

*Jihyun Lim,Junhyuk Jo,Chanhyeok Ko,Young Min Go,Jimin Hwa,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system-aware local SGD method for efficient neural network training in heterogeneous compute environments, outperforming synchronous SGD in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume homogeneous resources, leading to inefficiencies in heterogeneous systems. The goal is to optimize resource utilization.

Method: A local SGD method allocates workloads proportionally to compute capacity, with biased data sampling and model aggregation to leverage slower resources like CPUs.

Result: Controlled bias accelerates training, achieving comparable or higher accuracy than synchronous SGD within the same time budget.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and adaptable to diverse heterogeneous environments, including cloud and HPC clusters.

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes M3-Net, a graph-free MLP-based model for traffic prediction, addressing limitations of existing deep learning methods by using time series and spatio-temporal embeddings with an MLP-Mixer and MoE mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for traffic prediction rely on complex structures or designs, hindering efficient deployment on large-scale datasets.

Method: M3-Net uses time series and spatio-temporal embeddings with an MLP-Mixer and MoE mechanism, avoiding reliance on traffic network structures.

Result: Experiments show M3-Net outperforms in prediction performance and lightweight deployment.

Conclusion: M3-Net offers a cost-effective, efficient solution for traffic prediction without complex dependencies.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

*Dahai Yu,Dingyi Zhuang,Lin Jiang,Rongchao Xu,Xinyue Ye,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes UQGNN, a Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction, addressing the limitations of deterministic models and single-phenomenon probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal prediction models are either deterministic or focus on single phenomena, lacking uncertainty quantification and ignoring correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena.

Method: UQGNN introduces an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module and a multivariate probabilistic prediction module to capture complex spatial-temporal interactions and quantify uncertainties.

Result: UQGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 5% improvement in prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification on the Shenzhen dataset.

Conclusion: UQGNN effectively addresses the research gap by providing accurate and reliable multivariate spatiotemporal predictions with quantified uncertainties.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

*Keumseo Ryum,Jinu Gong,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHEFL is a federated learning framework addressing computational heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting resource allocation and introducing a bias-aware aggregation scheme, improving fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods struggle with data/system heterogeneity and fail to fully capture model diversity, limiting communication efficiency and fairness.

Method: SHEFL allocates global models based on client resources, introduces bias-aware aggregation, and dynamically adjusts resource ratios to mitigate data bias.

Result: Experiments show SHEFL effectively handles computational heterogeneity, enhancing fairness and overall performance.

Conclusion: SHEFL outperforms existing methods by addressing computational diversity and improving fairness in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning in cross-organizational data collaboration, accommodating diverse communication topologies.

Method: Proposes distributed optimization algorithms based on augmented Lagrangian techniques, incorporating proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, with multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms.

Result: The framework generalizes classical unconstrained optimization methods and demonstrates strong performance in large-scale, statistically heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a versatile and efficient solution for federated learning with rigorous theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

*Hyuntak Shin,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic-rank training framework interleaves full-rank and low-rank epochs to prevent rank collapse, achieving computational efficiency and accuracy comparable to full-rank training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed low-rank training caps weight matrix rank, hindering learning of complex patterns and accelerating rank decline during training.

Method: Interleave full-rank training epochs within low-rank training to dynamically adjust weight matrix rank and prevent collapse.

Result: The framework maintains computational cost similar to SVD-based low-rank training while matching full-rank training accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic-rank training effectively balances efficiency and performance, mitigating rank collapse without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

*Adit Krishnan,Chu Wang,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy for small language models to improve specialized semantic classification tasks, outperforming other methods while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized semantic classification tasks require domain expertise and high inference throughput, making large models impractical. Smaller models finetuned for specific tasks are preferred.

Method: A token-driven sparse finetuning strategy is developed, focusing on a sensitive subset of parameters using task-specific tokens, without adding new parameters.

Result: The method outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and prefix tuning on five tasks, with greater stability and half the training costs.

Conclusion: Token-driven sparse finetuning is effective for specialized semantic classification, offering performance and cost advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

TL;DR: MiGrATe introduces online test-time training (TTT) with GRPO for LLMs, balancing exploration and exploitation without external data, outperforming baselines in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of prior methods in balancing exploration and exploitation in black-box optimization tasks with LLMs, and eliminating the need for hand-crafted training data.

Method: MiGrATe uses GRPO for online TTT, combining on-policy sampling with greedy and neighborhood sampling to adapt LLMs at inference.

Result: MiGrATe outperforms inference-only and TTT baselines in word search, molecule optimization, and ARC tasks.

Conclusion: Online TTT with MiGrATe is a promising solution for complex search tasks without external supervision, improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M²LLM, a multi-view framework combining molecular structure, task, and rules views, leveraging LLMs for superior molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular representation methods like fingerprints and GNNs ignore semantic and contextual knowledge, while LLMs offer rich reasoning and prior knowledge.

Method: M²LLM integrates molecular structure, task, and rules views, dynamically fusing them for task adaptation.

Result: M²LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs enhance molecular representations through encoding and reasoning, proving effective in property prediction.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

*Shibin Su,Guoqiang Liang,De Cheng,Shizhou Zhang,Lingyan Ran,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach using a Global Workspace Model (GWM) and multi-level collaborative distillation improves stability and adaptability in Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) under strict memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCIL faces challenges in balancing stability and adaptability under strict memory constraints, where current methods like replay-based or ensemble approaches fall short.

Method: Proposes a GWM to fuse student model parameters, capturing historical learning, and a multi-level distillation mechanism for peer-to-peer consistency and knowledge alignment.

Result: Significant performance improvement on three OCIL benchmarks across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances stability and plasticity in OCIL, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative bidding method using expert-guided conditional diffusion modeling and skip-step sampling to improve efficiency and performance in auto-bidding, outperforming traditional reinforcement learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auto-bidding methods lack personalized structural information and suffer from timeliness risks in diffusion models. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: Proposes a conditional diffusion modeling method guided by expert trajectories and a skip-step sampling strategy for efficient generation.

Result: Offline experiments and online A/B tests showed an 11.29% increase in conversions and a 12.35% rise in revenue compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances generative bidding by improving planning capabilities and efficiency, validated by significant performance gains.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

*Michael Li,Eric Bae,Christopher Haberland,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the generalization issue of neural network solvers for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by introducing COGS, a method using generative sampling for better data coverage and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks for TSP struggle with generalization beyond synthetic training data, especially in realistic distributions, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes Combinatorial Optimization with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a generative TSP model, and introduces TSPLib50 for real-world testing.

Result: COGS improves distribution robustness, particularly in worst-case scenarios, outperforming existing neural baselines on synthetic datasets and TSPLib50.

Conclusion: COGS offers a promising approach to enhance the robustness of neural solvers for TSP, addressing generalization gaps in real-world applications.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

### [210] [Elucidating Rectified Flow with Deterministic Sampler: Polynomial Discretization Complexity for Multi and One-step Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08735)
*Ruofeng Yang,Zhaoyu Zhu,Bo Jiang,Cheng Chen,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves polynomial discretization complexity for rectified flow (RF)-based models in multi-step and one-step generation, outperforming diffusion models and prior methods like VP and VE-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical works on RF-based models lack analysis of discretization complexity, with prior results either limited to stochastic samplers or exhibiting exponential dependence on parameters.

Method: Under bounded support assumptions, the paper analyzes RF-based models with deterministic samplers, introduces a Langevin process as a corrector for multi-step settings, and compares RF to VP and VE-based models.

Result: RF-based models achieve better polynomial discretization complexity than diffusion models and prior methods, with the first such result for one-step models.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical grounding for the empirical success of RF-based models in generation tasks, marking progress in understanding their performance.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

### [211] [Interpretable Reward Model via Sparse Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08746)
*Shuyi Zhang,Wei Shi,Sihang Li,Jiayi Liao,Tao Liang,Hengxing Cai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARM integrates a Sparse Autoencoder into reward models for interpretable, dynamic, and superior alignment of LLMs with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models lack interpretability and flexibility, hindering effective alignment of LLMs with human values.

Method: SARM uses a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder to map LLM activations into an interpretable feature space, enabling transparent reward scoring.

Result: SARM provides feature-level attribution, adapts to preference shifts, and outperforms conventional reward models.

Conclusion: SARM offers a scalable and interpretable solution for aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

### [212] [Differentiated Information Mining: A Semi-supervised Learning Framework for GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08769)
*Long Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFac is a semi-supervised framework for GNNs that derives differentiated factors from a single source, enforces consistency, and integrates auxiliary textual knowledge to improve robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining mutually independent decision factors in SSL for GNNs, which is difficult due to scarce and unreliable additional information sources.

Method: DiFac extracts differentiated factors from one source, removes conflicting samples, ranks pseudo-labels, and incorporates auxiliary textual knowledge with an accountability scoring mechanism.

Result: DiFac outperforms baselines in low-label regimes, showing improved robustness and generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DiFac effectively mitigates pseudo-label bias and training collapse, enhancing SSL performance for GNNs.

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

### [213] [TechOps: Technical Documentation Templates for the AI Act](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08804)
*Laura Lucaj,Alex Loosley,Hakan Jonsson,Urs Gasser,Patrick van der Smagt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces open-source templates for AI documentation to comply with the EU AI Act, covering data, models, and applications, ensuring traceability and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI documentation lacks coverage of the full lifecycle and compliance with the EU AI Act, necessitating better tools.

Method: Develops and refines open-source templates for documentation, validated through user feedback and real-world scenarios.

Result: Templates improve traceability, reproducibility, and compliance, demonstrated in datasets, models, and applications.

Conclusion: TechOps templates enable regulatory compliance and responsible AI development, validated in practical use cases.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

### [214] [TempOpt -- Unsupervised Alarm Relation Learning for Telecommunication Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08814)
*Sathiyanaryanan Sampath,Pratyush Uppuluri,Thirumaran Ekambaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised technique, TempOpt, is proposed to learn alarm relations in telecommunications networks, improving root alarm identification over existing temporal dependency methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of managing enormous volumes of interconnected alarms in telecommunications networks necessitates accurate and efficient root alarm identification.

Method: Proposes TempOpt, an unsupervised alarm relation learning technique, to overcome limitations of temporal dependency methods.

Result: TempOpt demonstrates improved quality of alarm relations compared to temporal dependency methods in real-world network datasets.

Conclusion: TempOpt offers a practical solution for enhancing root alarm identification in network monitoring.

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

### [215] [Wavelet Mixture of Experts for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08825)
*Zheng Zhou,Yu-Jie Xiong,Jia-Chen Zhang,Chun-Ming Xia,Xi-Jiong Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveTS-B and WaveTS-M, lightweight time series models combining wavelet transforms and MLPs, addressing limitations of Transformers and MLPs in capturing non-stationary and multi-channel dependencies. WaveTS-M, enhanced with a Mixture of Experts framework, achieves SOTA performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of Transformers (parameter-heavy, poor non-stationary feature capture) and MLPs (weak multi-channel dependency handling) in time series forecasting.

Method: WaveTS-B uses wavelet transforms with MLPs for periodic and non-stationary data. WaveTS-M adds a channel clustering strategy with a Mixture of Experts framework for multi-channel dependencies.

Result: WaveTS models achieve SOTA performance on eight datasets, with WaveTS-M excelling in multi-channel scenarios, using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The WaveTS series offers efficient, high-performing solutions for time series forecasting, particularly for multi-channel data.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

*Eric Seng,Hugh O'Connor,Adam Boyce,Josh J. Bailey,Anton van Beek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for creating tailored training datasets for generative models, combined with Bayesian optimization, improves interpretability and design exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming constraints of large datasets and lack of interpretability in generative machine learning for design.

Method: Systematic framework for generating archetypes and integrating generative models with Bayesian optimization.

Result: Validated by designing a flow battery manifold, capturing feasible designs and enabling efficient exploration.

Conclusion: Enhances quality and reliability of generative models in system design.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

*Fuyao Zhang,Xinyu Yan,Tiantong Wu,Wenjie Li,Tianxiang Chen,Yang Cao,Ran Yan,Longtao Huang,Wei Yang Bryan Lim,Qiang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Oblivionis is a framework for federated LLM training that supports selective data removal, addressing privacy and compliance gaps in existing FL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated LLM frameworks lack mechanisms for regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR's right to be forgotten) and struggle with data quality and governance.

Method: Introduces Oblivionis, a lightweight framework unifying FL and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, incorporating 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms.

Result: Oblivionis outperforms local training, balancing forgetting efficacy and model utility, with cross-algorithm insights for future LLM development.

Conclusion: Oblivionis enhances trustworthiness and compliance in federated LLM training, offering a robust solution for selective data removal.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

*Julian Schönberger,Maximilian Zorn,Jonas Nüßlein,Thomas Gabor,Philipp Altmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using genetic algorithms to identify subnetworks in randomly initialized neural networks (Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis) that perform well without training, achieving better accuracy and sparsity than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in deep learning by avoiding overparameterization and training costs, leveraging the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.

Method: Genetic algorithms are used to find high-performing subnetworks in untrained, overparameterized networks.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in binary and multi-class classification tasks in terms of accuracy and sparsity, without gradient information.

Conclusion: Genetic algorithms effectively identify strong lottery ticket subnetworks, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics for complex tasks.

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to improve regularization and uncertainty quantification, addressing challenges through flexible trainable activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance BNNs by embedding intuitive beliefs directly into the model's output for better regularization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making.

Method: Uses optimization techniques with flexible activation models (e.g., Pade functions, piecewise linear functions) to accommodate complex priors and match target distributions.

Result: Empirical results show BNNs with a single wide hidden layer and flexible activations can achieve desired function-space priors.

Conclusion: Flexible trainable activations enable BNNs to effectively incorporate function-space priors, even with simple architectures.

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates for the use of synthetic experiments in evaluating causal machine learning methods, arguing they are essential for precise assessment and understanding, despite criticisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underutilization of causal machine learning due to unreliable evaluations, the paper highlights the necessity of synthetic experiments for robust assessment.

Method: Critically reviews current evaluation practices, identifies shortcomings, and proposes principles for rigorous empirical analyses using synthetic data.

Result: Proposes a framework for comprehensive evaluations to enhance trust and adoption of causal machine learning methods.

Conclusion: Synthetic experiments are crucial for reliable evaluations, and adopting the proposed principles can drive broader, impactful use of causal machine learning.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

TL;DR: APRNet is a deep learning model for time series forecasting that decouples amplitude and phase in frequency domain to better capture stationary information, outperforming SOTAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to explore stationary information from complex frequency components in time series data.

Method: APRNet models amplitude-phase inter-relationships, uses a KLC module for adaptive local function fitting, and represents multivariate time series across sequence and channel dimensions.

Result: APRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in capturing time-varying patterns.

Conclusion: APRNet effectively decouples amplitude and phase, enhancing stationary feature extraction and forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerability to stage-transferred attacks in class-incremental continual learning, revealing high susceptibility and insufficient defense effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlooked vulnerability of continual learning models to adversarial attacks, specifically stage-transferred attacks.

Method: Analyzes stage-transferred attacks, where adversarial examples from earlier stages attack later stages, and evaluates model similarity and robustness degradation.

Result: Continual learning methods are highly vulnerable to stage-transferred attacks, and existing defenses are ineffective.

Conclusion: The study highlights a serious security issue in continual learning and calls for improved defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

TL;DR: LNN-PINN enhances PINNs with a liquid residual gating architecture, improving predictive accuracy without altering the original pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often lack accuracy in complex problems, prompting the need for architectural refinements.

Method: Introduces a lightweight gating mechanism in hidden layers while keeping other components unchanged.

Result: Reduces RMSE and MAE across benchmarks, showing adaptability to varying conditions.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN effectively improves PINN accuracy for complex scientific and engineering tasks.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenCast improves traffic forecasting for regions without sensors by leveraging external knowledge and physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic forecasting is hindered by the lack of sensors in some regions, limiting the generalisability of existing models.

Method: GenCast integrates physics-informed neural networks, an external signal learning module, and a spatial grouping module to enhance generalisability.

Result: GenCast reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the challenge of forecasting in sensor-less regions by incorporating external knowledge and physical principles.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

*Etienne Gael Tajeuna,Jean Marie Tshimula*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAVITY is a graph-based learning framework for vertex classification, inspired by physical systems, using dynamic interactions and potential fields to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance vertex classification by modeling interactions and forces akin to physical systems, enabling dynamic and context-aware learning.

Method: GRAVITY models vertices as exerting influence through learned interactions, creating a latent potential field for energy-efficient positioning and dynamic aggregation.

Result: GRAVITY outperforms in transductive and inductive vertex classification tasks, producing competitive embeddings.

Conclusion: GRAVITY's dynamic, physics-inspired approach effectively sharpens class boundaries and improves semantic coherence in vertex classification.

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-domain-based adversarial attack method for time series forecasting, showing current models' vulnerability and the method's effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting lack sufficient study on adversarial robustness, especially in leveraging frequency domain features for attacks.

Method: Adapts a classification attack method to prediction tasks, optimizing adversarial samples using time-domain and frequency-domain losses.

Result: Demonstrates vulnerability of current models to adversarial attacks; the proposed method performs well on major datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for adversarial robustness in time series forecasting and presents a novel frequency-domain attack approach.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

### [227] [Integrating attention into explanation frameworks for language and vision transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08966)
*Marte Eggen,Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using attention weights in transformers to enhance explainability in AI, proposing two new methods integrating attention into XAI frameworks for NLP and CV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage attention weights for richer model explanations, complementing existing explainability techniques.

Method: Develops two methods: 1) integrating attention into Shapley value decomposition for local explanations, and 2) using attention with concept activation vectors for global explanations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show attention weights meaningfully enrich transformer explainability in XAI frameworks.

Conclusion: Attention weights can effectively enhance transformer explainability when integrated into XAI methods.

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Vinay Sutar,Jaya Prakash Champati,Sharayu Moharir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL) for edge intelligence systems, proposing two policies (HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite) that achieve order-optimal regret and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage in edge intelligence systems by leveraging local and remote ML models effectively.

Method: Model the probability of correct local inference as a function of confidence, and propose HI-LCB and HI-LCB-lite policies based on the UCB framework.

Result: Both policies achieve $O(\log T)$ regret, outperforming existing methods with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret. HI-LCB-lite has $O(1)$ computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed policies are efficient and practical for resource-limited devices, validated by real-world simulations.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

TL;DR: MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model, translates target curves into mechanism designs, outperforming baselines with high accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanism design is complex due to vast search spaces of topologies and parameters. MechaFormer addresses this by treating it as a conditional sequence generation task.

Method: MechaFormer translates target curves into a domain-specific language (DSL) string, determining topology and parameters in a unified process. It includes sampling strategies for improved quality.

Result: MechaFormer achieves state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy, generates diverse novel designs, and provides excellent starting points for traditional optimizers.

Conclusion: MechaFormer offers a hybrid approach combining generative and optimization methods, delivering superior solutions efficiently.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPIAID, a machine learning algorithm for personalized opioid dosage prediction to optimize pain management and reduce adverse events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pain management and minimize opioid-related adverse events (ORADE) by providing personalized dosage recommendations.

Method: Uses causal machine learning trained on EHR data to analyze relationships between opioid dose, patient characteristics, and outcomes.

Result: OPIAID provides personalized opioid dose recommendations based on patient-specific factors and opiate influences.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a promising approach for tailored pain management while mitigating ORADE risks.

Abstract: This paper introduces the OPIAID algorithm, a novel approach for predicting
and recommending personalized opioid dosages for individual patients. The
algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse
events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational
electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning
approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific
patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The
OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence
of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper
outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key
assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

*Bisman Singh,Lucy Van Kleunen,Aaron Clauset*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper systematically evaluates link prediction methods in relational data, comparing model stacking, neural networks, and topological predictors across 550 networks, finding no universal best method but highlighting the role of network characteristics. A meta-learning algorithm is introduced to optimize predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best approach for predicting missing links in networks without node attributes and understand how algorithm choice depends on network characteristics.

Method: Comparison of four stacking algorithms, 42 topological link predictors, and two graph neural networks on 550 diverse real-world networks using AUC and Top-k accuracy measures. Introduction of a meta-learning algorithm for optimal method selection.

Result: No single algorithm performs best across all networks; stacking with random forest is highly scalable and competitive. Performance depends on network traits like degree distribution and triangle density. The meta-learning algorithm outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Algorithm performance is network-dependent, and the proposed meta-learning approach effectively selects the best method for individual networks, improving accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

*Gabrielle Berrada,Jannik Kossen,Muhammed Razzak,Freddie Bickford Smith,Yarin Gal,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active testing is scaled for large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning for cheap surrogate models, reducing data needs and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of active testing for large models, making it feasible for LLM evaluation.

Method: Use in-context learning to create cheap surrogate models, avoid updating them in the loop, and introduce a single-run error estimator.

Result: Effective LLM evaluation with less data and lower computational costs compared to standard practices.

Conclusion: Active testing can be efficiently scaled for LLMs, improving evaluation efficiency.

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

### [234] [Chi-Geometry: A Library for Benchmarking Chirality Prediction of GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09097)
*Rylie Weaver,Massamiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry is a library for generating synthetic graph data to benchmark GNNs' chirality prediction, enabling interpretable testing and guiding new GNN designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a controlled and interpretable way to benchmark GNNs' ability to predict chirality, avoiding confounding factors in real-world data.

Method: Generates synthetic graphs with user-specified geometric/topological traits and randomized node positions/species, labeled for chirality (R/S or N/A).

Result: Used to benchmark SOTA GNNs, leading to two new architectures: one with all-to-all connections (high accuracy but quadratic cost) and one with a virtual node (linear cost, competitive accuracy).

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry effectively guides GNN design, balancing accuracy and computational cost for chirality prediction.

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

*Tianyun Yang,Yunwen Li,Ziniu Li,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GF-Reasoner, a model combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with formal language to improve Geometry Problem Solving (GPS) accuracy by 15%, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models struggle with GPS due to unreliable diagram interpretation and lack of intermediate reasoning.

Method: Integrates CoT with formal language, using supervised fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset and solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 15% accuracy improvement on GPS benchmarks, surpassing peers and larger models.

Conclusion: The hybrid reasoning approach enhances accuracy and clarity, with insights for future research.

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE is a universal neural model for reasoning over heterogeneous structured data, combining a set-based Transformer with semantic grounding to align and predict across disjoint datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is diverse and disjoint, making it hard to build general-purpose models. ASPIRE aims to address this by enabling semantic reasoning across heterogeneous datasets.

Method: ASPIRE uses a permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer and a semantic grounding module incorporating natural language, metadata, and examples to learn cross-dataset dependencies.

Result: ASPIRE generalizes to new tasks without tuning and performs well across benchmarks, also supporting cost-aware feature acquisition.

Conclusion: ASPIRE advances toward universal, semantics-aware inference over structured data.

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

*Jiani Ni,He Zhao,Yibo Yang,Dandan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaC-Cal is a mask-based classifier calibration method using stochastic sparsity to improve DNN confidence alignment with accuracy, addressing underconfidence issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs often have poor calibration, especially in safety-critical fields, leading to unreliable confidence estimates. Existing methods overlook underconfidence errors.

Method: MaC-Cal uses a two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask retention rates based on confidence-accuracy deviation.

Result: MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration and robustness under data corruption.

Conclusion: MaC-Cal provides a practical solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

*Wei Wang,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun,Arnaud Liefooghe,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper extends the homotopic convex (HC) transformation to unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP), constructs a unimodal toy UBQP, and introduces an iterative framework (LSILS) and its parallel variant (PC-LSILS) to improve smoothing and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) like UBQP and TSP have many local optima, making them hard to solve. The paper aims to smooth their solution spaces using HC transformation.

Method: The authors construct a unimodal toy UBQP, prove its unimodality, and use HC transformation to smooth the original UBQP. They introduce LSILS and PC-LSILS for iterative and parallel optimization.

Result: Experiments show LSILS and PC-LSILS improve smoothing and performance on UBQP and TSP instances.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively smooth solution spaces and enhance algorithmic performance, with PC-LSILS offering further improvements.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the
massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various
methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including
homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary
quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy
UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy
UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP
by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing
effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework
incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local
search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances
show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel
cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP
and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the
smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the
overall performance of the algorithm.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of different toy UBQP problems on landscape smoothing in LSILS, finding that the toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 ("+/-i") is most effective, while random construction (^Q3) performs poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different toy UBQP problems affect the rugged landscape smoothing in UBQP optimization, improving the efficiency of LSILS.

Method: Assessed landscape flatness of three toy UBQPs (^Q1, ^Q2, ^Q3) and tested LSILS efficiency with each.

Result: Toy UBQP with ^Q1 had the flattest landscape, while ^Q3 was least flat. LSILS with ^Q2 was most effective, and ^Q3 performed worst.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into landscape smoothing techniques, highlighting the effectiveness of specific toy UBQP constructions in optimizing UBQP.

Abstract: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is
due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,
including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from
other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a
convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our
study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using
different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by
"+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with
matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the
three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different
toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1")
exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3
(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using
the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective,
while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings
contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in
optimizing UBQP.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SafeKV is a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework for LLM inference, balancing performance and security by selectively sharing non-sensitive cache entries and mitigating timing side-channel attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global KV-cache sharing optimizes LLM inference but introduces timing side-channel attacks, while existing defenses like per-user isolation degrade performance. SafeKV aims to address this gap.

Method: SafeKV includes a hybrid detection pipeline, a unified radix-tree index, and entropy-based access monitoring to manage public/private cache entries and mitigate leakage.

Result: SafeKV mitigates 94%-97% of attacks, improves TTFT by up to 40.58%, and boosts throughput by up to 2.66X compared to per-user isolation.

Conclusion: SafeKV combines fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse, reclaiming performance benefits while ensuring robust privacy for LLM inference.

Abstract: Global KV-cache sharing has emerged as a key optimization for accelerating
large language model (LLM) inference. However, it exposes a new class of timing
side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via
shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate
leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),
making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we
introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware
KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries
while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three
components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates
rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and
context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public
and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and
(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual
information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of
timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,
SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across
diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from
50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with
high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of
global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM
inference.

TL;DR: The paper explores mutual information estimators to detect privacy leakage in selectively encrypted images, addressing gaps in quantitative privacy measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy lacks a universal quantitative measure, and information leakage in image data is underexplored. The study aims to bridge this gap using mutual information estimators.

Method: Uses empirical estimator and MINE framework to detect leakage in selectively encrypted images, leveraging probabilistic frameworks for spatial dependencies.

Result: Proposes a promising direction for estimating image information leakage using robust mutual information estimators.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of privacy leakage in images, offering a novel approach for future research.

Abstract: As digital data transmission continues to scale, concerns about privacy grow
increasingly urgent - yet privacy remains a socially constructed and
ambiguously defined concept, lacking a universally accepted quantitative
measure. This work examines information leakage in image data, a domain where
information-theoretic guarantees are still underexplored. At the intersection
of deep learning, information theory, and cryptography, we investigate the use
of mutual information (MI) estimators - in particular, the empirical estimator
and the MINE framework - to detect leakage from selectively encrypted images.
Motivated by the intuition that a robust estimator would require a
probabilistic frameworks that can capture spatial dependencies and residual
structures, even within encrypted representations - our work represent a
promising direction for image information leakage estimation.

Motivation: Existing studies on AI security are fragmented, making it hard to understand relationships and impacts. A holistic approach is needed.

Method: Develop an AI security map with two aspects: Information System Aspect (ISA) and External Influence Aspect (EIA), identifying negative impacts for each element.

Result: The map clarifies relationships, causes, and countermeasures for negative impacts, linking system and stakeholder effects.

Conclusion: The AI security map provides new insights, recommendations, and open problems for future research in AI security.

Abstract: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research
and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However,
existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks,
defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it
extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative
impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the
knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be
holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this
end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes
interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative
impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two
aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence
aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems
are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect
stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,
corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security
map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes
and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative
impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some
findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several
recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities.

### [243] [Generative AI for Critical Infrastructure in Smart Grids: A Unified Framework for Synthetic Data Generation and Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08593)
*Aydin Zaboli,Junho Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection system (ADS) for IEC61850-based digital substations, addressing cybersecurity challenges and data scarcity through advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) and task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital substations face cybersecurity threats due to advanced communication protocols like GOOSE, which introduce vulnerabilities. Traditional ADSs are limited in detecting these threats, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The research leverages GenAI to develop ADSs, using AATM for synthetic dataset generation and ToD processes for improved attack pattern detection. A comparison with ML-based ADSs is conducted.

Result: The GenAI-based ADS outperforms ML-based ADSs, demonstrating enhanced detection capabilities using AATM-generated datasets and standard performance metrics.

Conclusion: GenAI-based ADSs offer a transformative solution for cybersecurity in digital substations, effectively addressing data scarcity and improving threat detection.

Abstract: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the
sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the
implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough
process of anomaly identification and detection in information and
communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and
reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within
digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity
challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart
grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic
object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and
introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the
limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting
threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging
generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include
the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to
generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring
protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to
address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs
incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for
improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based
ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the
outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated
GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies LLM fingerprinting attacks and defenses, using reinforcement learning for optimized attacks and semantic-preserving filtering for defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and security risks posed by fingerprinting attacks on large language models in sensitive environments.

Method: Offensive: Reinforcement learning for query optimization. Defensive: Semantic-preserving output filtering via a secondary LLM.

Result: Attack method improves accuracy with fewer queries; defense reduces fingerprinting accuracy without degrading output quality.

Conclusion: Demonstrates improved fingerprinting tools and practical defenses against such attacks.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive environments,
fingerprinting attacks pose significant privacy and security risks. We present
a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives.
Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize
query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries
compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive
approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM
to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive
method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving
output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve
fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation
strategies against fingerprinting attacks.

TL;DR: A deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed for distributed networks, using CNNs and novel algorithms to enhance transferability of attack knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep learning models' ability to detect unknown attacks by leveraging knowledge from known attacks in a distributed network setup.

Method: Proposes a CNN model with two algorithms: a two-step data pre-processing stage and a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA) algorithm to maximize transferability relationships.

Result: Achieves superior transferability performance and high local detection rates, with generalizability across datasets and backbones.

Conclusion: The system effectively enhances IDS capabilities by improving transferability and maintaining strong detection performance.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected
device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection
system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a
network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown
attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms
to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that
maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data
pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA)
algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability
performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show
that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across
datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found

### [246] [EditMF: Drawing an Invisible Fingerprint for Your Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08836)
*Jiaxuan Wu,Yinghan Zhou,Wanli Peng,Yiming Xue,Juan Wen,Ping Zhong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EditMF is a training-free fingerprinting method for LLMs, embedding imperceptible ownership bits with minimal overhead, ensuring robust and secure verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting LLM intellectual property is critical due to high training costs, but existing methods lack stealth and efficiency.

Method: EditMF maps ownership bits to compact triples from an encrypted knowledge base, uses causal tracing for layer localization, and injects fingerprints with zero-space updates.

Result: EditMF achieves high imperceptibility, negligible performance loss, and robustness surpassing LoRA-based methods, nearing SFT embeddings.

Conclusion: EditMF is an effective, low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and expensive,
making protecting intellectual property (IP) for LLMs crucial. Recently,
embedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for
establishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer
from limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we
propose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly
imperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.
Ownership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from
an encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist
facts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each
triple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing
unrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and
succeeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical
results on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high
imperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering
robustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT
embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditMF is an effective and
low-overhead solution for secure LLM ownership verification.

*Jiayi Li,Chengxi Yan,Yurong Zeng,Zhichao Fang,Huiru Wang*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Topic-Method Composition (TMC) to analyze the interplay between research topics and methods in Digital Humanities, addressing gaps in previous bibliometric studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies lacked depth in understanding the relationship between technological advancements and topic development in DH, leading to superficial conclusions.

Method: The study proposes a TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis to examine knowledge structures.

Result: The workflow provides detailed insights into the intersection of digital technology and humanities, adaptable to other fields.

Conclusion: TMC offers a novel approach to understanding DH's interdisciplinary nature, enhancing interpretability of topic-method relationships.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it
enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable
to other fields.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency of computing π by finding Machin-like arctangent relations with minimal Lehmer measures.

Method: Combines PSLQ integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters from Gaussian integers for tractable large-scale search.

Result: Discovered new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures (λ=1.4572, λ=1.3291).

Conclusion: The constrained PSLQ search and algorithmic extension method is effective for future exploration of low-measure relations.

Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$,
with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a
framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ
integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the
algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable.
Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures
($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered
relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through
algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and
algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high-quality, child-friendly speech generation for low-resource languages in education.

Result: Superior performance in objective metrics and subjective evaluations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MultiAiTutor effectively supports language learning for children in diverse cultural contexts.

Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in
personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world
applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving

particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural
contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual
generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture

integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM
architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through
culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages:

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EGGCodec is a neural framework for EGG signal reconstruction and F0 extraction, using multi-scale frequency-domain and time-domain losses, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve EGG signal reconstruction and F0 extraction accuracy by leveraging reconstructed signals and simplifying the training process.

Method: Uses multi-scale frequency-domain and time-domain loss functions, removes GAN discriminator, and trains on an EGG-inclusive dataset.

Result: Reduces MAE from 14.14 Hz to 13.69 Hz and improves VDE by 38.2%, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: EGGCodec is efficient and effective, validated by ablation studies, and sets a new benchmark for F0 extraction.

Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered
for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We
propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced
relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a
time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike
conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec
leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By
removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training
process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance
degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive
evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0
extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69
Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based framework to model US citizens' evolving attitudes toward China over 20 years, addressing large-scale, cross-border opinion dynamics and media bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model large-scale, long-term opinion evolution across countries, specifically US attitudes toward China, leveraging LLMs for advanced reasoning and debiased media analysis.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating media data collection, user profiling, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates, including debiased media exposure and a devil's advocate agent.

Result: Successfully reproduces real US attitude trends toward China, revealing the impact of media bias and selection bias on opinion formation.

Conclusion: The work pioneers LLM-based modeling of cross-border cognitive behaviors, offering insights into international bias formation and implications for bias reduction.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a
long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to
recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works
focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views
within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution
of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens'
perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we
propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile
creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully
reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period
from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased
media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news
contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a
devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to
positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way
Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond
validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing
and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new
paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,
long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation
of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers
to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately
contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural
tolerance.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for estimating spatiotemporally varying indoor lighting from a single image or video using 2D diffusion priors and MLP representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of estimating spatially and temporally varying indoor lighting from limited input (single image/video) due to its ill-posed nature.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion priors to optimize a light field represented as an MLP. Uses a fine-tuned pre-trained image diffusion model to predict lighting at multiple locations by inpainting chrome balls as light probes.

Result: Superior performance in indoor lighting estimation from single images or videos, with spatiotemporally consistent results on in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of estimating varying indoor lighting, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world scenes.

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

*Dalton Omens,Allise Thurman,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for retargeting facial performances between humans or virtual characters using volumetric morphing and Simon-Says expressions, with a fine-tuning approach to improve animation control semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the retargeting of facial performances between humans or virtual characters by addressing semantic mismatches and control issues.

Method: Uses volumetric morphing and Simon-Says expressions for rig calibration, followed by fine-tuning via implicit differentiation to enhance control semantics.

Result: Calibrated rigs produce desired expressions but may yield undesirable controls during tracking; fine-tuning improves semantic meaningfulness of controls.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-tuning method enhances retargeting efficacy by addressing control issues while maintaining acceptable geometry reconstructions.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

*Dasith de Silva Edirimuni,Xuequan Lu,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Lei Wei,Gang Li,Scott Schaefer,Ying He*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: HybridPF combines short-range and long-range filtering trajectories for point cloud denoising, achieving state-of-the-art results with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud filtering methods often suffer from clustering or noise retention issues, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: HybridPF uses two parallel modules (ShortModule and LongModule) with encoder-decoder pairs for short-range scores and long-range flows, guided by a joint loss function. A dynamic graph convolutional decoder is introduced to address decoder limitations.

Result: HybridPF yields filtered point clouds with good point distributions and faster convergence to clean surfaces, outperforming current methods.

Conclusion: HybridPF effectively combines short and long-range filtering, addressing key weaknesses in existing methods and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance color scheme control in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompts, improving colorization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models lack comprehensive control over color schemes, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not explicitly mentioned in prompts.

Method: The proposed approach integrates color palettes as a guidance mechanism within a diffusion-based framework, exploring various palette representation methods. Specialized datasets are constructed for evaluation.

Result: Incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, offering more refined control.

Conclusion: The method enhances color scheme control in T2I generation, enabling more precise and controlled colorization.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

TL;DR: DiffPhysCam is a differentiable camera simulator for robotics and AI, enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual cameras lack control over settings and fail to capture optical artifacts, limiting sim-to-real transfer.

Method: DiffPhysCam uses a multi-stage pipeline for fine-grained camera control, modeling optical effects, and supporting calibration with real data.

Result: It improves robotic perception in synthetic tasks and enables digital twin creation for autonomous navigation.

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam enhances sim-to-real transfer and supports both forward and inverse rendering for robotics applications.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VertexRegen is a mesh generation framework offering continuous detail levels, outperforming autoregressive methods by enabling valid meshes at any generation step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods produce incomplete structures during generation, lacking flexibility in detail levels.

Method: VertexRegen reverses edge collapse (vertex split) using a generative model, inspired by progressive meshes.

Result: Produces meshes comparable to state-of-the-art, with unique anytime generation capability.

Conclusion: VertexRegen provides flexible, high-quality mesh generation with continuous detail control.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of

*Zixin Yin,Xili Dai,Ling-Hao Chen,Deyu Zhou,Jianan Wang,Duomin Wang,Gang Yu,Lionel M. Ni,Heung-Yeung Shum*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ColorCtrl is a training-free method for text-guided color editing in images and videos, leveraging MM-DiT attention mechanisms for precise control and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise color control and introduce visual inconsistencies, prompting the need for a more accurate and consistent solution.

Method: Disentangles structure and color by manipulating attention maps and value tokens in MM-DiT, enabling word-level attribute intensity control.

Result: Outperforms existing training-free methods and commercial models in edit quality, consistency, and temporal coherence in videos.

Conclusion: ColorCtrl is versatile, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various models and tasks, including instruction-based editing.

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

*Meng Gai,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A learning-based method predicts diffuse indirect illumination in screen space for real-time global illumination, combining it with direct illumination for HDR results. The approach uses a novel neural network with a modified attention mechanism and monochromatic design, outperforming previous methods in handling complex lighting and new scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time rendering with global illumination is essential for realistic virtual environments, but capturing long-range indirect illumination with neural networks is challenging.

Method: A novel neural network architecture with a modified attention mechanism and monochromatic design predicts indirect illumination, aggregating global information via spatial geometry features.

Result: The method outperforms previous learning-based techniques, handling complex lighting, distant indirect illumination, and new scenes effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances real-time global illumination by effectively predicting indirect illumination and generalizing to unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

TL;DR: Capybara is an AI-powered AR tool enabling children to create and program 3D characters, bridging virtual and physical worlds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift children from consumers to creators of AI-enabled AR experiences.

Method: Capybara uses text-to-3D generative AI, auto-rigging, body tracking, and vision-based AI for object recognition.

Result: User studies with 20 children showed Capybara's effectiveness in empowering creative AR experiences.

Conclusion: Capybara successfully empowers children to create personalized AR experiences, blending virtual and physical worlds.

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

TL;DR: StreetViewAI is the first accessible street view tool for blind users, combining AI, navigation controls, and speech to enable virtual exploration of GSV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like Google Street View are inaccessible to blind users, limiting their ability to explore real-world environments virtually.

Method: StreetViewAI integrates context-aware AI, accessible controls, and conversational speech, designed iteratively with a mixed-visual ability team and evaluated with 11 blind users.

Result: The tool effectively supports blind users in POI investigations and remote route planning.

Conclusion: Key guidelines for future work are provided, emphasizing the importance of accessibility in virtual exploration tools.

Abstract: Interactive streetscape mapping tools such as Google Street View (GSV) and
Meta Mapillary enable users to virtually navigate and experience real-world
environments via immersive 360{\deg} imagery but remain fundamentally
inaccessible to blind users. We introduce StreetViewAI, the first-ever
accessible street view tool, which combines context-aware, multimodal AI,
accessible navigation controls, and conversational speech. With StreetViewAI,
blind users can virtually examine destinations, engage in open-world
exploration, or virtually tour any of the over 220 billion images and 100+
countries where GSV is deployed. We iteratively designed StreetViewAI with a
mixed-visual ability team and performed an evaluation with eleven blind users.
Our findings demonstrate the value of an accessible street view in supporting
POI investigations and remote route planning. We close by enumerating key
guidelines for future work.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the environmental harm of widespread Generative AI deployment and critiques tech companies for imposing AI use through deceptive interface designs and narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose how tech companies force AI adoption, contributing to environmental harm, and to align these practices with deceptive design patterns.

Method: Analyzes design strategies like replacing non-AI features and promoting AI narratives, fitting them into deceptive pattern categories.

Result: Identifies two main strategies for imposing AI use and discusses regulatory opportunities to mitigate environmental impact.

Conclusion: Calls for regulation to address the imposed adoption of AI features and their negative environmental effects.

Abstract: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale
that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech
companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and
show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive
pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented
to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

### [263] [Synthesize, Retrieve, and Propagate: A Unified Predictive Modeling Framework for Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08327)
*Ning Li,Kounianhua Du,Han Zhang,Quan Gan,Minjie Wang,David Wipf,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SRP is a predictive modeling framework for relational databases that captures both unary and composite dependencies, improving tabular data prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational databases hinder deep learning due to their structure. Existing methods focus on unary dependencies, leaving composite relations unexplored.

Method: SRP synthesizes features using unary dependencies, retrieves related information for composite dependencies, and propagates messages via a graph.

Result: SRP outperforms on five real-world datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and industrial applicability.

Conclusion: SRP enhances predictive modeling in relational databases by capturing more dependencies, with practical guidelines for future use.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released

### [264] [E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09023)

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite uses LLMs for SQL query rewriting, addressing rule-based limitations with execution-aware prompts and reinforcement learning, achieving faster and more successful rewrites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of rule-based SQL rewriting, which struggles with novel patterns and complex queries, by leveraging LLMs for more adaptable and effective rewrites.

Method: Proposes E3-Rewrite: an LLM-based framework with context construction (execution plans, demonstrations) and reinforcement learning (reward for executability, equivalence, efficiency).

Result: Achieves up to 25.6% faster execution and 24.4% more successful rewrites compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite effectively enhances SQL rewriting by combining LLMs with execution awareness and multi-objective learning, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

*Abrar Rahman Abir,Sajib Acharjee Dip,Liqing Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: CFM-GP is a scalable, cell type-agnostic method for predicting gene perturbation effects using a continuous, time-dependent transformation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is critical for therapeutic discovery and precision medicine, but existing methods lack scalability and generalization.

Method: CFM-GP uses a flow matching objective to model perturbation dynamics continuously, conditioned on cell type, enabling predictions across all cell types with a single model.

Result: CFM-GP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation across five datasets, with pathway enrichment confirming biological fidelity.

Conclusion: CFM-GP provides a robust, scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction, demonstrating superior performance and biological relevance.

Abstract: Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a
central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for
therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable
high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such
data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type.
Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type,
limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell
type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous,
time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression
distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict
across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling,
CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a
scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta
stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta
stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation,
and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.
These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a
scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to generate customized exams, evaluating their psychometric quality in real-world settings through iterative refinement and IRT analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating the quality of AI-generated questions in education and understand generative AI's role in test design.

Method: An iterative refinement strategy for question generation, involving cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision, evaluated in a large-scale field study across 91 classes.

Result: AI-generated questions performed comparably to expert-created ones in standardized exams, based on IRT analysis.

Conclusion: AI can effectively produce high-quality assessments, making them more accessible for educators and students.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized
exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments
more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students.

TL;DR: The study uses Monster theory to analyze AI's conflicting perceptions, comparing AI to monsters in popular culture for deeper insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on AI's advantages and challenges by exploring its representation through Monster theory.

Method: Applies the seven theses of Monster theory to discuss AI perception and development.

Result: AI, like monsters, is complex and context-dependent, with varied interpretations based on societal or cultural context.

Conclusion: The comparison between AI and monsters is valid, offering a unique lens to understand AI's societal impact.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

*David-Doron Yaacov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deliberative moral reasoning system for AI, integrating diverse ethical perspectives and enabling both deep reflection and responsive action through a dual-hybrid architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address complex moral situations in AI by developing a transparent, principled system that aligns with diverse ethical values and supports real-time decision-making.

Method: The framework uses a dual-hybrid structure: a universal moral threshold layer and a local context-sensitive layer, combining top-down and bottom-up learning for moral reasoning.

Result: The system enables AI to handle moral complexity, including conflicting beliefs and multifactorial dilemmas, while ensuring culturally specific norms align with universal thresholds.

Conclusion: The framework advances Machine Ethics and Value Alignment by providing a scalable, transparent approach for morally grounded AI decision-making in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

*Zeyu Tang,Alex John London,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Sanmi Koyejo,Peter Spirtes,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal, quantitative approach to incorporate social determinants into algorithmic fairness, addressing a gap in existing literature. It uses region as a proxy in college admissions to demonstrate practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithmic fairness literature overlooks social determinants, focusing mainly on sensitive attributes. This paper aims to bridge this gap by adding quantitative rigor to qualitative proposals.

Method: The study employs a region-based analysis with Gamma distribution parameterization to model the impact of social determinants on individual outcomes, tested in a college admissions setting.

Result: The method quantitatively aligns with nuanced qualitative insights, revealing that focusing solely on sensitive attributes may introduce new structural injustices.

Conclusion: Incorporating both sensitive attributes and social determinants is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of fairness, ensuring transparency and effectiveness in addressing discrimination.

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes
may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.
Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a
more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by
individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual
environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness
effectively and transparently.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates major AI companies' adherence to voluntary commitments made to the White House in 2023, revealing significant variability in compliance, especially in model weight security. It calls for better disclosure and accountability in AI governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well AI companies fulfill their voluntary commitments and identify gaps in governance to improve future initiatives.

Method: Developed a scoring rubric based on eight voluntary commitments, analyzing publicly disclosed behavior of 16 companies.

Result: OpenAI scored highest (83%), but the average was 52%. Model weight security scored worst (17% average, with 11 companies at 0%).

Conclusion: Future AI governance should enforce verifiable disclosures and accountability. Three recommendations are provided to address governance gaps.

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether synthetic data in healthcare should be classified as personal data under GDPR, analyzing legal and technical risks to advocate for clearer regulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in healthcare needs data, but privacy concerns under GDPR hinder the use of synthetic data, prompting a need for clarity.

Method: Systematic legal analysis and empirical study, including simulating inference attacks to assess identification risks.

Result: Synthetic data is likely anonymous under certain conditions, but uncertainties remain about reasonable risk thresholds.

Conclusion: Clearer regulations are needed to balance privacy and AI innovation in healthcare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

TL;DR: A co-design framework for LLM applications in under-resourced settings, focusing on precise information specification and multi-tier validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the disconnect between LLM developers and domain experts in under-resourced communities to create accurate and useful applications.

Method: A novel co-design framework decomposing tasks into optimizable attributes and refining them through multi-tier cascading validation.

Result: Improved accuracy, comprehensiveness, and verifiability of LLM-generated summaries for social needs.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective co-design in resource-constrained settings, prioritizing precise information specification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

### [274] [AI Agents and the Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08544)
*Mark O. Riedl,Deven R. Desai*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the technical and socio-legal challenges of agentic AI, highlighting gaps in computer science's alignment with legal concepts like loyalty and third-party interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how AI systems executing tasks directly for users must align with socio-legal agency principles to avoid unintended effects.

Method: Combines technical and legal perspectives to compare AI agent theories with legal agency concepts, focusing on under-specification, loyalty, and third-party interactions.

Result: Identifies gaps in AI's alignment with legal agency, particularly in loyalty and disclosure, and proposes improvements for responsible AI development.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a path for integrating legal agency principles into AI to ensure responsible and effective agentic systems.

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

### [275] [Who pays the RENT? Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08573)
*Tasfia Mashiat,Patrick J. Fowler,Sanmay Das*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of AI-powered targeting policies for scarce resource allocation, introducing the RENT metric to compare individual and neighborhood-based approaches in eviction prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile conflicting findings in prior research on the usefulness of targeting policies under varying inequality conditions.

Method: Develops a stylized framework using the Mallows model and introduces the RENT metric, calibrated with eviction court records from a US city.

Result: Individually targeted policies show significant gains in reaching high-risk households, even in highly segregated areas.

Conclusion: Discrepancies in prior literature are explained by deployment costs and risk concentration, guiding AI-based social service deployment.

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

*Farzana Zahid,Anjalika Sewwandi,Lee Brandon,Vimal Kumar,Roopak Sinha*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses cybersecurity risks of using Educational Large Language Models (eLLMs) in education, categorizes 50 attacks, and assesses their severity using the DREAD framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity threats posed by eLLMs in educational settings.

Method: Develops a taxonomy of 50 LLM attacks, categorizing them as targeting models or infrastructure, and evaluates their severity in education using the DREAD framework.

Result: Identifies token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step jailbreak as critical attacks on eLLMs.

Conclusion: The taxonomy and risk assessment aid in building resilient eLLM solutions for education.

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various
organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models
(LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and
institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and
institutions.

### [277] [Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08976)
*Ziyi Guo,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Urban-STA4CLC, a model predicting post-disaster commercial land use changes by integrating urban theories with spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, outperforming baselines by 19% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models fail to capture the complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use changes post-disasters, which urban theories address more effectively.

Method: Urban-STA4CLC combines spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules (resilience, spatial economic, and diffusion theories) to predict land use changes.

Result: The model achieves a 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763) over baselines, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: Embedding urban theories into land use modeling enhances prediction accuracy, aiding research on disaster impacts and economic shifts.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

TL;DR: The study evaluates ten leading LLMs on privacy certification exams, finding some models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 exceed human certification standards, highlighting their potential and gaps in privacy and AI governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can reliably support privacy professionals in regulatory compliance, privacy management, and AI governance.

Method: Benchmarked ten open and closed LLMs using official IAPP certification exams (CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, AIGP) in a closed-book setting.

Result: Several models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5, scored above human certification thresholds, showing expertise in privacy law and AI governance.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong potential for high-stakes privacy roles but have domain-specific gaps, offering insights for professionals integrating AI into regulatory compliance.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent
questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten
leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on
industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the
International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was
tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to
IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such
as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the
standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial
expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results
highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer
practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists
assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This
paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI
advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on
human-centric evaluations.

TL;DR: An AI-driven pipeline optimizes LLM adapter allocation in single-node setups, enhancing performance and resource efficiency, with a Digital Twin validating results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation and overheads in serving diverse LLM adapters by optimizing their allocation.

Method: Developed an analytical pipeline and a Digital Twin to replicate and predict optimal adapter placement based on workload patterns.

Result: Digital Twin achieves ≤5.5% SMAPE difference in throughput; pipeline predicts optimal placement with minimal latency.

Conclusion: The approach improves performance and resource efficiency in LLM adapter serving, scalable to multi-replica deployments.

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

*Kate A. Richardson,Sokratis Trifinopoulos,Mike Williams*

Main category: nucl-th

TL;DR: An AI model for predicting nuclear binding energies achieves high precision and interpretability, revealing insights like a double helix structure in its internal representation and hierarchical factorization of predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-precision nuclear mass predictions, especially where measurements are unavailable, and the challenge of assessing AI model reliability in extrapolation.

Method: Development of an interpretable AI model that hierarchically factorizes predictions and aligns with known symbolic models like the liquid drop.

Result: The AI model achieves cutting-edge precision, with its improvements largely attributed to a historical observation by Jaffe (1969).

Conclusion: The study presents a fully interpretable, data-driven model for nuclear masses, bridging AI and physics insights.

Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently
nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics
research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this
task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However,
the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are
only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires
extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are
largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to
assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision
for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and
explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation
form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link
the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each
isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be
factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms
corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).
Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost
entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result
is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA), an improved version of FMA, which uses subsampled datasets for training to enhance exploration-exploration functionality in black-box optimization problems. SFMA outperforms FMA in speed and accuracy, especially for large-scale problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving complex black-box optimization problems efficiently by combining quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging subsampling to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Developed SFMA by modifying FMA to train on subsampled datasets instead of full datasets, enhancing exploration-exploitation balance. Used numerical benchmarking to compare SFMA with FMA.

Result: SFMA demonstrated superior exploration-exploitation functionality, outperforming FMA in speed and accuracy. Performance further improved with sequential subsampling of varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: SFMA is effective for large-scale black-box optimization problems, offering scalability and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving thermodynamic problems, interprets them for designing quantum states, and introduces stabilizer thermodynamic systems with applications in encoding qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimum energy of quantum thermodynamic systems with non-commuting charge constraints and explore applications in quantum state design and stabilizer codes.

Method: Benchmarking first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms on quantum Heisenberg models and stabilizer thermodynamic systems.

Result: The algorithms converge to global optima and can design ground/thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians. They also enable qubit encoding into stabilizer codes at fixed temperatures.

Conclusion: The hybrid algorithms are effective for thermodynamic problems and qubit encoding, with potential applications in molecular and material design.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSPO, a method for aligning speech durations in video dubbing by treating it as a preference optimization problem, improving synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing audio-video synchronization issues caused by duration mismatches in video dubbing due to varying language information densities.

Method: Proposes Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO), using segment-wise sampling and fine-grained loss for duration alignment.

Result: SSPO outperforms in duration alignment tasks, enhancing synchronization.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively mitigates duration mismatches in video dubbing, improving viewer experience.

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A normalization technique improves ASR performance by aligning feature representations with a clean reference channel, addressing degradation from channel variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR models degrade with different recording channels, often attributed to training-testing mismatches. This study identifies channel-induced speech variations as a fundamental issue.

Method: Proposes a normalization technique to align internal ASR model features with those from a clean reference channel.

Result: Significantly improves ASR performance on unseen channels and languages, demonstrating cross-channel and cross-language generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively mitigates channel variation impact, enhancing ASR robustness across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of single-target attacks by targeting multiple speakers and simulating realistic conditions.

Method: Uses position-independent clicking sounds as triggers, varies signal-to-noise ratios, and selects targets based on cosine similarity.

Result: Achieves up to 95.04% success in identification and 90% in verification for highly similar speaker pairs.

Conclusion: The attack is highly effective, especially when target and enrolled speakers are similar, balancing stealth and success.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a multi-target backdoor attack against speaker
identification using position-independent clicking sounds as triggers. Unlike
previous single-target approaches, our method targets up to 50 speakers
simultaneously, achieving success rates of up to 95.04%. To simulate more
realistic attack conditions, we vary the signal-to-noise ratio between speech
and trigger, demonstrating a trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. We
further extend the attack to the speaker verification task by selecting the
most similar training speaker - based on cosine similarity - as the target. The
attack is most effective when target and enrolled speaker pairs are highly
similar, reaching success rates of up to 90% in such cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The healthcare AI domain faces data scarcity, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, prompting the need for synthetic data to enhance model reliability.

Method: A CNN is trained on the Coughvid dataset, then augmented with synthetic Mel Spectrograms generated by an ACGAN to improve classification accuracy.

Result: The CNN's test accuracy rose from 72% to 75% using synthetic cough data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity in healthcare AI, though challenges in training consistency remain.

Abstract: One of the fastest-growing domains in AI is healthcare. Given its importance,
it has been the interest of many researchers to deploy ML models into the
ever-demanding healthcare domain to aid doctors and increase accessibility.
Delivering reliable models, however, demands a sizable amount of data, and the
recent COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of the rampant and scary nature
of healthcare that makes training models difficult. To alleviate such scarcity,
many published works attempted to synthesize radiological cough data to train
better COVID-19 detection models on the respective radiological data. To
accommodate the time sensitivity expected during a pandemic, this work focuses
on detecting COVID-19 through coughs using synthetic data to improve the
accuracy of the classifier. The work begins by training a CNN on a balanced
subset of the Coughvid dataset, establishing a baseline classification test
accuracy of 72%. The paper demonstrates how an Auxiliary Classification GAN
(ACGAN) may be trained to conditionally generate novel synthetic Mel
Spectrograms of both healthy and COVID-19 coughs. These coughs are used to
augment the training dataset of the CNN classifier, allowing it to reach a new
test accuracy of 75%. The work highlights the expected messiness and
inconsistency in training and offers insights into detecting and handling such
shortcomings.

TL;DR: QAMRO is a framework for evaluating audio generation systems by integrating regression objectives to better align with human perception, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating audio generation systems overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments, limiting accuracy.

Method: QAMRO uses Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization, leveraging pre-trained audio-text models like CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, trained on the AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset.

Result: QAMRO shows superior alignment with human evaluations across dimensions, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: QAMRO effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, improving accuracy in audio generation evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM),
text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the
subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods
treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard
regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address
this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin
Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives
from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and
prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text
models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the
official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment
with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming
robust baseline models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper critiques the rhetoric of democratization in AI music tools, revealing a disconnect between marketing and actual inclusivity, driven by individualist and techno-liberal ideologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ideologies behind generative-AI music tools and assess whether their democratization claims hold true.

Method: Combines autoethnography and digital ethnography to analyze four AI music systems (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, Udio) and their developer rhetoric vs. user reception.

Result: Finds a shared 'total ideology' among producers and consumers: individualist, globalist, techno-liberal, and ethically evasive, reshaping music practice for generative outcomes.

Conclusion: The democratization rhetoric often masks deeper ideological biases, transforming music-making in ways that evade ethical responsibility.

Abstract: AI systems for music generation are increasingly common and easy to use,
granting people without any musical background the ability to create music.
Because of this, generative-AI has been marketed and celebrated as a means of
democratizing music making. However, inclusivity often functions as marketable
rhetoric rather than a genuine guiding principle in these industry settings. In
this paper, we look at four generative-AI music making systems available to the
public as of mid-2025 (AIVA, Stable Audio, Suno, and Udio) and track how they
are rhetoricized by their developers, and received by users. Our aim is to
investigate ideologies that are driving the early-stage development and
adoption of generative-AI in music making, with a particular focus on

TL;DR: The paper surveys WBAN architectures, routing, and security, identifies gaps, and proposes an LLM-driven adaptive framework for 6G-ready medical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating 6G, post-quantum cryptography, and energy harvesting into WBANs for enhanced adaptability, energy efficiency, and security.

Method: Surveys existing WBAN technologies and proposes a novel Large Language Model-driven adaptive framework for real-time coordination.

Result: Identifies gaps in current WBAN designs and outlines a research agenda for future 6G-ready medical systems.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-driven framework aims to enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-gen mobile health.

Abstract: Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) enable continuous monitoring of
physiological signals for applications ranging from chronic disease management
to emergency response. Recent advances in 6G communications, post-quantum
cryptography, and energy harvesting have the potential to enhance WBAN
performance. However, integrating these technologies into a unified, adaptive
system remains a challenge. This paper surveys some of the most well-known
Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) architectures, routing strategies, and
security mechanisms, identifying key gaps in adaptability, energy efficiency,
and quantum-resistant security. We propose a novel Large Language Model-driven
adaptive WBAN framework in which a Large Language Model acts as a cognitive
control plane, coordinating routing, physical layer selection, micro-energy
harvesting, and post-quantum security in real time. Our review highlights the
limitations of current heuristic-based designs and outlines a research agenda
for resource-constrained, 6G-ready medical systems. This approach aims to
enable ultra-reliable, secure, and self-optimizing WBANs for next-generation
mobile health applications.

*Conghao Zhou,Lulu Sun,Xiucheng Wang,Peng Yang,Feng Lyu,Sihan Lu,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agent-driven communication service for edge-assisted MAR, using LLMs to bridge MAR and network domains, and a user-level QoE model for efficient resource management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce communication overhead in MAR while ensuring QoE, addressing gaps between MAR service and network domains.

Method: Uses LLM-powered digital agents and a user-level QoE modeling method for personalized resource management.

Result: Outperforms conventional LLM-based methods in QoE modeling accuracy and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges MAR and network domains, enhancing QoE and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

*Zihan Fang,Zheng Lin,Senkang Hu,Yihang Tao,Yiqin Deng,Xianhao Chen,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DUAL-Health, an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework, improves outdoor health monitoring by addressing noise challenges in sensor data and enhancing multimodal fusion and data recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional outdoor health monitoring methods are limited by noise in sensor data and inefficient multimodal fusion, necessitating a robust solution like DUAL-Health.

Method: DUAL-Health quantifies modality uncertainty, customizes fusion weights based on noise levels, and aligns modality distributions in a common semantic space.

Result: DUAL-Health outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses noise challenges and improves outdoor health monitoring performance.

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: Wireless systems need spatially consistent channel representations for efficient communication tasks. Channel charting provides this, and integrating it with DNTs can enhance performance.

Method: Proposes Chartwin, combining localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic DNTs. Uses semi-supervised learning for spatially consistent radio maps.

Result: Achieves ~4.5m localization error for static DNT and ~6m for dynamic DNT, demonstrating effective DNT-aided channel charting.

Conclusion: Chartwin successfully integrates channel charting with DNTs, improving localization accuracy and fostering DNT-aided wireless communication.

Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the

TL;DR: ReQuestNet is a novel neural architecture for channel estimation in 5G, simplifying the pipeline and outperforming legacy MMSE solutions with up to 10dB gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of legacy linear MMSE solutions and handle practical wireless communication challenges like variable RBs and dynamic transmit layers.

Method: Uses two sub-units: CoarseNet for per-PRG, per-Tx-Rx stream estimation, and RefinementNet to refine estimates by exploiting correlations.

Result: Significantly outperforms genie MMSE, achieving up to 10dB gain at high SNRs and generalizing well to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: ReQuestNet is a robust, unified solution for channel estimation in 5G, excelling in performance and adaptability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

TL;DR: The paper explores a temporal voting model for public chores, analyzing welfare optimization, computational complexity, fairness, and strategic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of voting on public chores with changing preferences and their impact on welfare and fairness.

Method: Investigates computational complexity of utilitarian and egalitarian welfare optimization, examines temporal fairness, and analyzes strategic agent behavior.

Result: Utilitarian welfare optimization is straightforward, while egalitarian welfare is intractable in most cases, though some efficient solutions exist. Fairness enforcement affects welfare, and strategic behavior insights are provided.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in egalitarian welfare optimization, identifies efficient cases, and discusses fairness measures and strategic implications for decision-making.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: OISMA is a novel in-memory computing architecture using quasi-stochastic computing to improve efficiency and scalability for AI workloads, achieving high accuracy and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-memory computing architectures face limitations in performance and energy efficiency, hindering AI model scalability.

Method: OISMA leverages quasi-stochastic computing (Bent-Pyramid system) to convert memory reads into stochastic multiplications, with an accumulation periphery for matrix multiplication.

Result: OISMA reduces Frobenius error significantly (9.42% to 1.81%) and achieves 0.891 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency.

Conclusion: OISMA offers scalable, efficient in-memory computing for AI, with potential for further improvements in advanced technology nodes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant
up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads
representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing
architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both
digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from
various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy
efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing
architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic
computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,
scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory
read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a
negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output
multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.
Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the
accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4
to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average
relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared
to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB
capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house
RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for
energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area
of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a
significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one
order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication
in-memory computing architectures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for tendon-driven robotic hands, addressing challenges in mapping sEMG signals to tendon controls. It also proposes a diffusion-based regression model for accurate tendon control prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tendon-driven robotic hands lack a direct mapping between mocap data and tendon controls, and visual tracking methods are unreliable. sEMG sensors offer a robust alternative, but mapping sEMG to tendon control remains challenging.

Method: The authors extend the emg2pose dataset to include tendon control signals using the MyoSuite MyoHand model. They provide baseline regression models and propose a novel diffusion-based regression model for tendon control prediction.

Result: The dataset includes recordings from 193 subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. The proposed diffusion model demonstrates improved accuracy in predicting tendon control from sEMG signals.

Conclusion: This work advances tendon-driven robotic manipulation by providing a scalable dataset and modeling framework, enabling more accurate and practical tendon control in robotic hands.

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a

TL;DR: SDAX is a learning framework that reduces human effort in training legged robots by using unsupervised skill discovery and bi-level optimization for agile locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training legged robots rely heavily on reward engineering, expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning, limiting generalizability.

Method: SDAX uses unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously learn diverse obstacle-overcoming skills and employs bi-level optimization to regulate exploration.

Result: SDAX enables robots to learn agile behaviors like crawling, climbing, and leaping, and successfully transfers these to real hardware.

Conclusion: SDAX reduces human engineering effort and enhances generalizability, proving effective for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in robotic pick-and-place tasks due to dense arrangements, occlusions, and object variations in convenience stores.

Method: Annotation-guided visual prompting with bounding boxes and ACT for imitation learning to predict chunked action sequences.

Result: Improved grasp accuracy and adaptability in retail environments, validated by success rate and visual analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enhances robotic pick-and-place performance in complex retail settings.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and

*Ben Zandonati,Tomás Lozano-Pérez,Leslie Pack Kaelbling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RIR is a framework for inferring latent programs from few demonstrations, enabling robots to generalize better than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to generalize from few demonstrations, unlike humans who can infer underlying explanations.

Method: RIR uses a hierarchical generative model and Bayesian program induction to infer structured symbolic task hypotheses.

Result: RIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, generalizing to novel settings with just one demonstration.

Conclusion: RIR effectively bridges the gap between human-like generalization and robotic learning by inferring latent programs.

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

TL;DR: SpectraLLM is a large language model for multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation without heavy reliance on prior databases or expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structure elucidation depend on prior databases and expert knowledge, are costly, and struggle with unknown or complex structures.

Method: SpectraLLM integrates continuous and discrete spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, learning substructural patterns for end-to-end structure elucidation.

Result: SpectraLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six chemical datasets, outperforming single-modality approaches and showing robustness in single-spectrum inference.

Conclusion: SpectraLLM offers a scalable, accurate solution for structure elucidation, reducing reliance on expert knowledge and improving multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the
microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various
disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods
often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making
it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures
typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This
process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by
high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these
challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to
support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of
processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing
end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete
spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to
uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across
spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and
fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six
standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches
trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong
robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its
multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural
prediction.

TL;DR: The paper proposes APCIR, an adaptive personalization method for conversational information retrieval, dynamically adjusting personalization levels and ranking fusion weights to improve search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR systems often use a one-size-fits-all personalization approach, which may not suit all queries, leading to sub-optimal performance.

Method: APCIR identifies required personalization levels, integrates personalized queries with reformulations, and uses dynamic ranking fusion weights.

Result: APCIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TREC iKAT datasets, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive personalization in CIR systems enhances performance by tailoring personalization to query needs.

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Nitin Yadav,Changsung Kang,Hongwei Shang,Ming Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReLSum is a reinforcement learning framework that generates query-relevant summaries of product descriptions to improve e-commerce search relevance, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product titles lack detail for accurate relevance predictions, and verbose descriptions are unsuitable for real-time ranking. ReLSum addresses this gap.

Method: ReLSum uses reinforcement learning with relevance scores as rewards to train an LLM for generating concise summaries, which feed into a cross-encoder ranking model.

Result: Significant improvements in offline metrics (recall, NDCG) and online user engagement metrics were observed.

Conclusion: ReLSum offers a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing search relevance in e-commerce systems.

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

TL;DR: LLM-TUP improves content-based recommender systems by modeling short-term and long-term user preferences using LLMs and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user profiling methods are too simplistic and fail to capture nuanced preference dynamics, especially the interaction between short-term and long-term preferences.

Method: LLM-TUP leverages interaction timestamps and LLMs to generate natural language representations of user histories, encodes them into embeddings using BERT, and dynamically fuses them with an attention mechanism.

Result: LLM-TUP outperforms baselines on real-world datasets, showing the effectiveness of temporally aware and semantically rich user profiles.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances personalized recommendations by better modeling user preference dynamics through LLM-driven profiling.

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

### [305] [Using LLMs to Capture Users' Temporal Context for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08512)
*Milad Sabouri,Masoud Mansoury,Kun Lin,Bamshad Mobasher*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for creating time-aware user profiles, focusing on disentangling short-term and long-term preferences for context-aware recommendations. Results show effectiveness varies with interaction history richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional user profiling lacks nuance in capturing temporal contextual factors like transient and enduring preferences, necessitating dynamic user understanding.

Method: Systematic investigation of LLMs for generating semantically rich, time-aware user profiles, adapting short-term and long-term preferences into comprehensive embeddings.

Result: LLM-generated profiles show semantic depth and temporal structure, with notable gains in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV) but limited improvements in sparse ones (e.g., Video Games).

Conclusion: LLMs have nuanced potential for adaptive recommendations, but their effectiveness depends on dataset characteristics, emphasizing the need for rich interaction histories.

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

*Francesco Fabbri,Gustavo Penha,Edoardo D'Amico,Alice Wang,Marco De Nadai,Jackie Doremus,Paul Gigioli,Andreas Damianou,Oskar Stal,Mounia Lalmas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel framework using LLMs as offline judges for podcast recommendations, leveraging profile-aware evaluation to improve scalability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline metrics suffer from exposure bias, and online methods like A/B testing are costly. A scalable, interpretable solution is needed for evaluating personalized recommendations in long-form audio domains.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) constructs natural-language user profiles from 90 days of listening history, summarizing interests and behaviors; (2) uses these profiles to prompt LLMs for fine-grained judgments on recommendation alignment.

Result: In a study with 47 participants, the profile-aware LLM judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed raw listening history-based evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient, profile-aware evaluation for recommender systems, enabling scalable and interpretable testing and model selection.

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

### [307] [SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09090)
*Jialiang Shi,Yaguang Dou,Tian Qi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SPARC is a novel retrieval framework addressing challenges in multi-interest modeling by dynamically evolving user interests and proactive exploration, showing significant improvements in online and offline metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-interest retrieval methods fail to dynamically adapt to users' real-time preferences and lack proactive exploration of new interests.

Method: SPARC uses Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) for discretized interest space and a probabilistic interest module for soft-search during online inference.

Result: Online A/B tests showed +0.9% user view duration, +0.4% page views, and +22.7% PV500 improvement. Offline metrics (Recall@K, NDCG@K) also improved.

Conclusion: SPARC effectively addresses dynamic interest modeling and proactive exploration, validated by significant gains in both online and offline evaluations.

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Multifidelity linear regression methods improve accuracy in high-dimensional output systems with limited high-fidelity data by integrating low-fidelity data via projection-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of surrogate modeling for high-dimensional outputs with costly training data by leveraging multifidelity methods.

Method: Two projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches: (i) direct data augmentation with low-fidelity data, and (ii) data augmentation with linear corrections between fidelities, using weighted least squares.

Result: 3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy over single-fidelity methods in low-data regimes (≤10 high-fidelity samples).

Conclusion: Multifidelity linear regression is effective for high-dimensional outputs with limited high-fidelity data, offering improved accuracy without added computational cost.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for systems with high-dimensional quantities of interest
remains challenging, particularly when training data are costly to acquire.
This work develops multifidelity methods for multiple-input multiple-output
linear regression targeting data-limited applications with high-dimensional
outputs. Multifidelity methods integrate many inexpensive low-fidelity model
evaluations with limited, costly high-fidelity evaluations. We introduce two
projection-based multifidelity linear regression approaches that leverage
principal component basis vectors for dimensionality reduction and combine
multifidelity data through: (i) a direct data augmentation using low-fidelity
data, and (ii) a data augmentation incorporating explicit linear corrections
between low-fidelity and high-fidelity data. The data augmentation approaches
combine high-fidelity and low-fidelity data into a unified training set and
train the linear regression model through weighted least squares with
fidelity-specific weights. Various weighting schemes and their impact on
regression accuracy are explored. The proposed multifidelity linear regression
methods are demonstrated on approximating the surface pressure field of a
hypersonic vehicle in flight. In a low-data regime of no more than ten
high-fidelity samples, multifidelity linear regression achieves approximately
3% - 12% improvement in median accuracy compared to single-fidelity methods
with comparable computational cost.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL) for multiclass classification, deriving tight bounds and showing optimality for transformer-based models and MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical performance of ICL in multiclass classification and identify architectures capable of effective ICL.

Method: Model tasks as sequences of labeled prompts and query inputs, using KL divergence for risk analysis and introducing uniform empirical covering entropy for generalization control.

Result: Tight upper and lower bounds for expected excess risk, showing ICL achieves minimax optimal rate. MLPs also perform optimally under certain conditions.

Conclusion: ICL is theoretically sound for multiclass classification, with transformers and MLPs both capable of optimal performance under specific assumptions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.

*Joseph Paillard,Antoine Collas,Denis A. Engemann,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Hierarchical-CPI is a model-agnostic variable importance measure for medical imaging, addressing interpretability and high correlation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability of complex models in medical imaging is limited, and existing methods struggle with highly correlated data.

Method: Hierarchical-CPI groups variables hierarchically, ensuring computational tractability and error control, and uses tree-based importance allocation for high correlation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in neuroimaging datasets (ADNI and TDBRAIN), identifying biologically plausible variables.

Conclusion: Hierarchical-CPI improves interpretability and robustness in medical imaging, offering a practical solution for variable importance analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly expanded the repertoire of
predictive methods for medical imaging. However, the interpretability of
complex models remains a challenge, which limits their utility in medical
applications. Recently, model-agnostic methods have been proposed to measure
conditional variable importance and accommodate complex non-linear models.
However, they often lack power when dealing with highly correlated data, a
common problem in medical imaging. We introduce Hierarchical-CPI, a
model-agnostic variable importance measure that frames the inference problem as
the discovery of groups of variables that are jointly predictive of the
outcome. By exploring subgroups along a hierarchical tree, it remains
computationally tractable, yet also enjoys explicit family-wise error rate
control. Moreover, we address the issue of vanishing conditional importance
under high correlation with a tree-based importance allocation mechanism. We
benchmarked Hierarchical-CPI against state-of-the-art variable importance
methods. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in two neuroimaging datasets:
classifying dementia diagnoses from MRI data (ADNI dataset) and analyzing the
Berger effect on EEG data (TDBRAIN dataset), identifying biologically plausible
variables.

TL;DR: The paper contrasts backpropagation (BP) with biologically plausible Predictive Coding (PC), offering a tutorial introduction to PC, its formulation, and connections to BP and Kalman Filter, with practical Python examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BP, while effective for ANNs, relies on global error signals, unlike biological systems which use local updates (Hebbian model). PC provides a biologically plausible alternative with local updates and theoretical advantages.

Method: The paper introduces PC through tutorial-style content, covering its mathematical foundations, connections to BP and Kalman Filter, and practical implementation using PyTorch.

Result: PC is presented as a viable alternative to BP, leveraging local updates and automatic gradient scaling, with practical implementation guidance.

Conclusion: PC offers a biologically plausible and theoretically sound alternative to BP, with the paper providing a clear, tutorial-style introduction to its concepts and applications.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) of errors is the backbone training algorithm for
artificial neural networks (ANNs). It updates network weights through gradient
descent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between
predictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss
gradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight
updates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely
on a global error signal generated at the network's output.
  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight
updates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic
neurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.
Recently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically
plausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.
Originating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a
model of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,
linking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely
solely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as
automatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.
  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,
focusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known
optimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter
(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the
mathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python
examples using PyTorch.

TL;DR: A novel multi-agent workflow combining intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized sub-agents improves LLM-based code generation for complex projects, outperforming single-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex, multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes an integrated workflow using GPT-5 for intent translation, Elicit for semantic retrieval, NotebookLM for document synthesis, and Claude Code for multi-agent code generation and validation.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy and reliability in real-world repositories, with higher success rates and better context adherence than single-agent baselines.

Conclusion: The multi-agent system enhances LLM-based coding assistants, with implications for production deployment and future research on context management.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study compares open-source Small Language Models (SLMs) and large commercial LLMs for code generation, focusing on performance and energy efficiency. SLMs often match LLMs in correctness while being more energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the environmental impact of energy-intensive LLMs like ChatGPT drive the need to evaluate smaller, open-source alternatives for code generation.

Method: 150 LeetCode problems of varying difficulty were solved by three SLMs and two LLMs. Performance was measured by run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness, with human-written code as a baseline.

Result: LLMs scored highest in correctness, but SLMs were more energy-efficient in over 52% of cases when correct.

Conclusion: SLMs can be a viable, energy-efficient alternative to LLMs for certain programming tasks, balancing performance and sustainability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OmniLLP improves log level prediction by clustering source files based on semantic similarity and developer ownership, achieving higher accuracy (0.88-0.96 AUC) compared to random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log level choice is critical for system observability and performance, but current ML-based predictors use random in-context examples, ignoring code structure and logging practices.

Method: OmniLLP clusters source files by semantic similarity and developer ownership cohesion, using these clusters to provide coherent prompts for LLM-based predictors.

Result: OmniLLP improves AUC by up to 8% over random methods, achieving 0.88-0.96 AUC.

Conclusion: Integrating code semantics and developer ownership into LLM-based predictors enhances logging accuracy and system maintainability.

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes hallucinations in language models for code-related tasks like commit message and code review comment generation, revealing high hallucination rates and proposing improved detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored issue of hallucinations in structurally complex and context-dependent code change tasks, focusing on commit message and code review comment generation.

Method: Quantifies hallucination prevalence in language models and evaluates metric-based approaches for automatic detection, combining multiple metrics for better performance.

Result: Finds ~50% hallucinations in code reviews and ~20% in commit messages; combining metrics improves detection, with model confidence and feature attribution being effective.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better hallucination detection in code-related tasks and suggests combining metrics for improved performance, with potential for inference-time detection.

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four imputation methods for missing HR data in wearables, using both accuracy metrics and statistical distance measures, revealing gaps in current evaluation frameworks and proposing a new composite metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of imputation methods for missing HR data in wearables, which current metrics fail to assess properly.

Method: Evaluates linear interpolation, KNN, PCHIP, and B splines using predictive accuracy (RMSE, MAPE, MAE) and statistical distance measures (CDT, JS Distance) on HR datasets.

Result: Identifies limitations in existing imputation methods and evaluation frameworks, highlighting the need for better metrics.

Conclusion: Proposes a foundational framework for a composite evaluation metric to improve imputation quality assessment in physiological signals.

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the continuous monitoring
of vital physiological signals, essential for predictive modeling and early
detection of extreme physiological events. Among these physiological signals,
heart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and
managing cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events
such as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from
missing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various
imputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has
been evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,
which assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these
metrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in
physiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a
comprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear
interpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating
Polynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their
performance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance
measures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance
(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab
Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset. The analysis reveals
limitations in existing imputation approaches and the absence of a robust
framework for evaluating imputation quality in physiological signals. Finally,
this study proposes a foundational framework to develop a composite evaluation
metric to assess imputation performance.

Method: Separate model execution between cloud and devices, with the cloud assisting only in the prefill phase. Devices respond immediately after the first token, and a speed controller smooths TPOT. On-device prefill is amortized, and prompts are refined during cloud prefill.

Result: TTFT decreases by at least 60%, TPOT is reduced to tens of milliseconds, and cloud throughput increases by up to 15x.

Conclusion: P/D-Device effectively addresses resource bottlenecks, significantly improving latency and throughput in serving large language models.

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

### [319] [Benchmarking Federated Learning for Throughput Prediction in 5G Live Streaming Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08479)
*Yuvraj Dutta,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Sandip Chakraborty,Basabdatta Palit*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks federated learning (FL) strategies for network throughput prediction in 5G/6G, evaluating algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN) and architectures (LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, Transformer). FedBN excels in non-IID data, while LSTM and Transformers outperform CNNs. LSTM balances accuracy and efficiency, and FL integration improves QoE in streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate throughput prediction is critical for 5G/6G applications, but centralized methods fail in heterogeneous mobile environments with non-IID data. This paper explores FL to address these limitations.

Method: The study evaluates three FL aggregation algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN) and four time-series architectures (LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, Transformer) using five real-world datasets. It analyzes client heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length.

Result: FedBN performs robustly under non-IID conditions. LSTM and Transformers outperform CNNs by up to 80% in R2 scores. Transformers converge faster but need longer history windows. FL-based predictors improve QoE by 11.7% (LSTM) and 11.4% (Transformer) over FedAvg.

Conclusion: FL-based throughput prediction, especially with FedBN and LSTM/Transformer, offers scalable, privacy-preserving solutions for next-gen wireless networks, balancing accuracy, convergence, and context dependence.

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SharpXR is a structure-aware dual-decoder U-Net for denoising low-dose pediatric X-rays, preserving diagnostic details and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pediatric chest X-rays in low-resource settings suffer from noise due to low-dose protocols, compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Method: SharpXR uses a Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder and learnable fusion module, trained on simulated Poisson-Gaussian noise data.

Result: SharpXR outperforms baselines, improving pneumonia classification accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%.

Conclusion: SharpXR is effective for denoising pediatric X-rays, enhancing diagnostic accuracy in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

### [321] [Variational volume reconstruction with the Deep Ritz Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08309)
*Conor Rowan,Sumedh Soman,John A. Evans*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel variational volume reconstruction method using the Deep Ritz method addresses challenges in sparse, noisy slice data, avoiding segmentation and reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical imaging applications like MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) face challenges with noisy data, sparse slices, and computational expense.

Method: Combines regression loss on noisy slice data with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy for regularization, using neural networks and Monte Carlo integration.

Result: Produces high-quality reconstructed volumes quickly, even with sparse and noisy data.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes key challenges in volume reconstruction, offering a fast and reliable solution.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel preprocessing algorithm corrects large-scale spectral variability in hyperspectral unmixing, improving accuracy by up to 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale spectral variability from factors like topography and illumination degrades unmixing performance, necessitating a preprocessing solution.

Method: The algorithm isolates and compensates for multiplicative scale effects, providing a cleaner input for unmixing.

Result: Experimental validation shows error reductions of nearly 50% across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The algorithm is a complementary step for existing unmixing methods, enhancing accuracy and practicality.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

*Yingxue Pang,Shijie Zhao,Haiqiang Wang,Gen Zhan,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FreqSP, a model to predict optimal sharpening levels for videos, balancing quality and bitrate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpening improves video quality but increases bitrate and can cause over-sharpening. Finding the right balance is crucial.

Method: FreqSP uses CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal sharpening level from uncompressed source videos.

Result: Experiments show FreqSP effectively predicts sharpening levels for optimal quality-bitrate tradeoffs.

Conclusion: FreqSP successfully addresses the challenge of balancing video sharpening quality and bandwidth costs.

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

*Conall Daly,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel multi-camera dataset is introduced to fairly compare frame interpolation and view synthesis methods, revealing deep learning doesn't significantly outperform classical methods on real data, but 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in synthetic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets bias comparisons between frame interpolation and view synthesis; a fair evaluation requires a neutral dataset.

Method: A custom-built dense linear camera array creates a dataset for evaluating classical and deep learning frame interpolators against 3D Gaussian Splatting for view in-betweening.

Result: Deep learning methods don't outperform classical ones on real data (3.5 dB PSNR gap), but 3D Gaussian Splatting leads by 5 dB PSNR in synthetic scenes.

Conclusion: Dataset choice impacts method performance; 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in synthetic scenes, while classical methods hold up in real data.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores simple motion field processing methods to create a video quality metric for frame interpolation, proposing a divergence-based metric that correlates with perceptual scores and is computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated video frames is an ongoing challenge, and existing metrics like PSNR or SSIM may not align well with human perception.

Method: The study processes motion fields to develop a quality metric, evaluating it using the BVI-VFI dataset with perceptual scores. The proposed metric measures motion field divergence.

Result: The divergence-based metric correlates reasonably with perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is computationally faster (x2.7 speedup) than FloLPIPS. It favors perceptually pleasing frames over those with high PSNR/SSIM scores.

Conclusion: The proposed motion metric is effective for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms, aligning better with human perception and offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiffVolume, a conditional diffusion model for generating realistic and controllable future limit order book (LOB) volume snapshots, outperforming in realism, counterfactual generation, and downstream prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating high-dimensional LOB volume snapshots with temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns is challenging, despite advances with GANs.

Method: A conditional diffusion model (DiffVolume) is introduced, conditioned on past volume history, time of day, and target liquidity profiles.

Result: DiffVolume excels in realism (statistical properties), counterfactual generation (hypothetical scenarios), and improving downstream liquidity forecasting.

Conclusion: DiffVolume offers a powerful, flexible framework for realistic and controllable LOB volume generation.

Abstract: Modeling limit order books (LOBs) dynamics is a fundamental problem in market
microstructure research. In particular, generating high-dimensional volume
snapshots with strong temporal and liquidity-dependent patterns remains a
challenging task, despite recent work exploring the application of Generative
Adversarial Networks to LOBs. In this work, we propose a conditional
\textbf{Diff}usion model for the generation of future LOB \textbf{Volume}
snapshots (\textbf{DiffVolume}). We evaluate our model across three axes: (1)
\textit{Realism}, where we show that DiffVolume, conditioned on past volume
history and time of day, better reproduces statistical properties such as
marginal distribution, spatial correlation, and autocorrelation decay; (2)
\textit{Counterfactual generation}, allowing for controllable generation under
hypothetical liquidity scenarios by additionally conditioning on a target
future liquidity profile; and (3) \textit{Downstream prediction}, where we show
that the synthetic counterfactual data from our model improves the performance
of future liquidity forecasting models. Together, these results suggest that
DiffVolume provides a powerful and flexible framework for realistic and
controllable LOB volume generation.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SCOPE reduces input space dimensionality in game-playing tasks using DCT and sparsification, outperforming other evolutionary and reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large state spaces in games challenge evolutionary methods due to increased search space and slower convergence.

Method: SCOPE uses DCT to transform input states into sparse coefficient matrices, reducing dimensionality while retaining key features.

Result: SCOPE with CMA-ES outperforms OpenAI-ES, HyperNEAT, DQN, and A3C in Space Invaders, reducing input size by 53%.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively addresses the challenge of large state spaces in games, improving evolutionary learning performance.

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: AI pricing and advertising algorithms can lead to beneficial collusion (lower prices) when consumer search costs are high, but platform profits may require commission adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate concerns of tacit collusion among AI-driven pricing and advertising algorithms in e-commerce.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning calibrated to Amazon.com data, analyzing competition and consumer search costs.

Result: Algorithms can lower prices when search costs are high; platform profits improve with commission adjustments, not reserve prices.

Conclusion: AI algorithms can benefit consumers, sellers, and platforms under certain conditions, alleviating some regulatory concerns.

Abstract: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically
make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When
sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion -
the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically
investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and
advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical
strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,
which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.
Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms
can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,
and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases
the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive
prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower
advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our
second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency
keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our
estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different
product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative
interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage
index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we
analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price
adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission
adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the
potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help
sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate
such algorithms.

*Sourabh Balgi,Marc Braun,Jose M. Peña,Adel Daoud*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A novel copula-based method, $ho$-GNF, for sensitivity analysis in causal inference, accounting for unobserved confounding by modeling it as a Gaussian copula with parameter $ho$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of unobserved confounding in causal inference by providing a flexible and interpretable sensitivity analysis framework.

Method: Proposes $ho$-GNF, a causal graphical normalizing flow, to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $ho$, and introduces a Bayesian version for posterior inference.

Result: Generates $ho_{curve}$ to bound ACE and identify confounding strength needed to nullify ACE; validated with simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The $ho$-GNF method offers a robust and interpretable tool for sensitivity analysis in causal inference, with practical applications demonstrated.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding
in causal inference. The method builds on a copula-based causal graphical
normalizing flow that we term $\rho$-GNF, where $\rho \in [-1,+1]$ is the
sensitivity parameter. The parameter represents the non-causal association
between exposure and outcome due to unobserved confounding, which is modeled as
a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate
the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, accounting for various
confounding strengths. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we term the
$\rho_{curve}$, which provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of
assumed $\rho$ values. The $\rho_{curve}$ also enables scholars to identify the
confounding strength required to nullify the ACE. We also propose a Bayesian
version of our sensitivity analysis method. Assuming a prior over the
sensitivity parameter $\rho$ enables us to derive the posterior distribution
over the ACE, which enables us to derive credible intervals. Finally,
leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the
benefits of our sensitivity analysis method.

Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of\nthese models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of\nrecent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language\nmodels, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A\nDutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in\nDutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463\nsentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation,\nGender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting\nsentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the\nother advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that\nvarious language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and\nMistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using\nthe English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated\nin English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language\nmodels, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas\nDutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that\nassigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.\nThese findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,\nsuggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in\nshaping model biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a Dutch version of the CrowS-Pairs dataset to measure bias in Dutch language models and compares bias levels across Dutch, English, and French language models, finding that bias varies significantly across languages and contexts.", "motivation": "The rapid growth and widespread application of language models necessitates ensuring their safety and fairness, as these models are prone to exhibiting biases that amplify harmful stereotypes.

English models showed the highest bias levels, while Dutch models demonstrated the least bias. French models fell between English and Dutch in terms of bias levels. The study also found that assigning personas to language models affects their bias levels, indicating that context manipulation can influence model behavior.", "conclusion": "The findings reveal significant variability in bias across different languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a crucial role in shaping model biases.

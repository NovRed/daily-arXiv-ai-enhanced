Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across\nvarious benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose\ninformation. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often\nrequires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.\nThese limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such\nmethods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline\npanorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational\nreconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic\ndomain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a\nseamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that\nspans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different\nattention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while\nmodeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose\ninformation, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while\npreserving general performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SecTOW is an iterative defense-attack training method using reinforcement learning to enhance MLLM security by balancing defense and attack modules, improving robustness without over-refusing harmless inputs.", "motivation": "Addressing the sparsity of unsafe image-query pairs and intrinsic vulnerabilities in MLLMs, as existing methods either lack diversity or over-refuse harmless inputs.", "method": "SecTOW employs a defender and auxiliary attacker trained iteratively with GRPO, using reward mechanisms and quality monitoring to refine security and data diversity.", "result": "SecTOW significantly improves security on safety-specific and general benchmarks while maintaining general performance.", "conclusion": "SecTOW offers a robust solution to MLLM security challenges by iteratively refining defense and attack strategies, ensuring balanced performance."}}

### [1] [Towards Reliable AR-Guided Surgical Navigation: Interactive Deformation Modeling with Data-Driven Biomechanics and Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08048)
*Zheng Han,Jun Zhou,Jialun Pei,Jing Qin,Yingfang Fan,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven biomechanics algorithm is proposed for AR-guided surgical navigation, combining FEM-level accuracy with computational efficiency and a human-in-the-loop mechanism for surgeon interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate deformation modeling is critical for AR overlays in surgery, but existing methods are computationally expensive and struggle with large anatomical changes.

Method: A data-driven biomechanics algorithm is developed, integrating a human-in-the-loop mechanism for surgeon prompts to correct misalignments.

Result: The algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm, reduced to 2.78 mm with surgeon interaction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances accuracy and surgeon-algorithm collaboration, improving reliability in computer-assisted surgeries.

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ
models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize
critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling
is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment
between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the
finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high
computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing
algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced
by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical
correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy
while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel
human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables
surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,
thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt
dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available
dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration
error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive
framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our
framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while
enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more
reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

### [2] [ReCogDrive: A Reinforced Cognitive Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08052)
*Yongkang Li,Kaixin Xiong,Xiangyu Guo,Fang Li,Sixu Yan,Gangwei Xu,Lijun Zhou,Long Chen,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCogDrive improves autonomous driving in rare scenarios by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a diffusion planner, addressing domain gaps and action-space mismatches, and outperforms previous methods by 5.6 PDMS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle in rare scenarios due to domain gaps, action-space mismatches, and suboptimal imitation learning.

Method: ReCogDrive uses a three-stage approach: training VLMs on driving Q&A data, diffusion-based imitation learning, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 89.6 PDMS on NAVSIM, surpassing the previous vision-only SOTA by 5.6 PDMS.

Conclusion: ReCogDrive effectively bridges gaps in autonomous driving, enhancing performance in rare scenarios.

Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its
performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent
approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world
knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from
several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data
of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the
discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation
learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which
may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an
autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which
adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a
large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating
the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving
scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform
imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to
continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using
reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model
to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our
approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6
and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA
by 5.6 PDMS.

### [3] [CuRe: Cultural Gaps in the Long Tail of Text-to-Image Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08071)
*Aniket Rege,Zinnia Nie,Mahesh Ramesh,Unmesh Raskar,Zhuoran Yu,Aditya Kusupati,Yong Jae Lee,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuRe is a benchmarking suite for evaluating cultural representativeness in text-to-image systems, addressing biases in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I systems are biased toward Amero and Euro-centric cultures, neglecting the Global South. CuRe aims to measure and address this imbalance.

Method: CuRe uses a hierarchical dataset of 300 cultural artifacts across 32 subcategories, leveraging attribute specification to proxy human judgments.

Result: CuRe shows strong correlation with human judgments across various T2I systems and models, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons.

Conclusion: CuRe provides a scalable, open-source tool to assess and improve cultural diversity in T2I systems.

Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is
heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global
South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable
benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages
the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for
human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy
built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural
artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes
(food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's
categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing
their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling
fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger
correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual
similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders
(SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2,
Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three
variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0,
and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at
https://aniketrege.github.io/cure/.

### [4] [IGraSS: Learning to Identify Infrastructure Networks from Satellite Imagery by Iterative Graph-constrained Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08137)
*Oishee Bintey Hoque,Abhijin Adiga,Aniruddha Adiga,Siddharth Chaudhary,Madhav V. Marathe,S. S. Ravi,Kirti Rajagopalan,Amanda Wilson,Samarth Swarup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGraSS is a novel framework combining semantic segmentation and graph-based refinement to improve canal and road network mapping from noisy ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate canal and road network mapping is crucial for water and infrastructure management, but incomplete ground truth hinders learning approaches.

Method: IGraSS integrates RGB, NDWI, and DEM data in a semantic segmentation module and refines ground truth using graph-theoretic constraints.

Result: IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from 18% to 3% and improves canal identification. It also generalizes to road networks.

Conclusion: IGraSS is a robust framework for refining noisy ground truth and mapping infrastructure networks, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including
irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic
segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,
well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate
ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks
have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or
connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground
truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a
semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,
DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module
processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on
the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show
that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and
training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.
IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and
mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example,
applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

### [5] [Spectral Domain Neural Reconstruction for Passband FMCW Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08163)
*Harshvardhan Takawale,Nirupam Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpINRv2 is an enhanced neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using FMCW radar, addressing phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity at high frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve volumetric reconstruction accuracy under high-frequency regimes where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity are challenges.

Method: Introduces a differentiable frequency-domain forward model with closed-form synthesis and implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous scene modeling, along with sparsity and smoothness regularization.

Result: Outperforms classical and learning-based baselines, especially in high-frequency regimes, setting a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

Conclusion: SpINRv2 advances neural radar-based 3D imaging by preserving spectral fidelity and reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric
reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar.
Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that
allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and
sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully
differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar
response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural
representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike
time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency
spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to
disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions.
Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical
and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes,
establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

### [6] [Surgeon Style Fingerprinting and Privacy Risk Quantification via Discrete Diffusion Models in a Vision-Language-Action Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08185)
*Huixin Zhan,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to model surgeon-specific fingerprints in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework with a vision-language-action pipeline, balancing personalization and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems overlook surgeon personalization, despite distinct operating styles due to training, experience, and motor behavior.

Method: A discrete diffusion framework integrates with a vision-language-action pipeline, using multimodal inputs (video, intent language, privacy-aware embeddings) to predict gestures as a sequence denoising task.

Result: The method accurately reconstructs gesture sequences and learns unique surgeon motion fingerprints, but expressive embeddings increase identity leakage risk.

Conclusion: Personalized embeddings enhance performance but raise privacy concerns, highlighting the need to balance personalization with privacy in surgical AI.

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training,
experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this
personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained,
surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion
framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method
formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task,
conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent
language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill.
Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts
using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual
behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on
the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture
sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon.
To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership
inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task
performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage.
These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve
performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing
the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical
modeling. Code is available at:

### [7] [Open World Scene Graph Generation using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08189)
*Amartya Dutta,Kazi Sajeed Mehrab,Medha Sawhney,Abhilash Neog,Mridul Khurana,Sepideh Fatemi,Aanish Pradhan,M. Maruf,Ismini Lourentzou,Arka Daw,Anuj Karpatne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-World SGG is a training-free framework leveraging pretrained Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot scene-graph generation, eliminating the need for dataset-specific supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGG methods rely on dataset-specific supervision, limiting their adaptability to open-world scenarios with novel objects/relations.

Method: The approach uses multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and pair-refinement for zero-shot structured reasoning, enabling inference on unseen objects/relations.

Result: Experiments on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and PSG show VLMs can perform relational understanding without task-level training.

Conclusion: Open-World SGG demonstrates the potential of pretrained VLMs for zero-shot relational understanding, broadening applicability in open-world settings.

Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and
distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on
dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting
their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or
relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs)
typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG,
a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into
the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional
learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method
combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight
pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies
and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World
evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have
been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual
Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate
the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without
task-level training.

### [8] [Generative Learning of Differentiable Object Models for Compositional Interpretation of Complex Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08191)
*Antoni Nowinowski,Krzysztof Krawiec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study extends the Disentangler of Visual Priors (DVP) to handle multiple objects in scenes, improves training with latent-space loss functions, and introduces a new benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the DVP's capability to decompose multiple objects in scenes and address training challenges caused by image-space reconstruction loss plateaus.

Method: Extends DVP with latent-space loss functions, uses the decoder for additional training samples, and introduces a new benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms baselines (MONet and LIVE) in reconstruction quality and object decomposition, with improved training efficacy.

Conclusion: The extended DVP shows superior performance but highlights limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders, suggesting further research.

Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors
(DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the
perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation,
and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which
control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that
the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In
this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects
in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the
decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative
training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space,
but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is
otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the
image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach,
we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the
previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We
compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and
demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to
decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the
considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training,
and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the
ways in which they can be addressed.

### [9] [GIQ: Benchmarking 3D Geometric Reasoning of Vision Foundation Models with Simulated and Real Polyhedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08194)
*Mateusz Michalkiewicz,Anekha Sokhal,Tadeusz Michalkiewicz,Piotr Pawlikowski,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh,Varun Jampani,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIQ is a benchmark to evaluate geometric reasoning in vision and vision-language models, revealing their shortcomings in tasks like 3D reconstruction and symmetry detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack clear understanding of geometric properties, despite strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Method: GIQ uses synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra, testing tasks like 3D reconstruction, symmetry detection, mental rotation, and zero-shot classification.

Result: Models struggle with basic geometric forms, symmetry detection, and detailed differentiation, while vision-language assistants misinterpret properties like face geometry.

Conclusion: GIQ highlights gaps in geometric intelligence, aiming to improve geometry-aware representation learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs)
demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true
understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric
reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ
comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including
Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and
compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through
systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry
detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we
reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art
reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to
reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models
effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they
falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation,
such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit
remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting
basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is
publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address
critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in
robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

### [10] [A Comprehensive Study of Decoder-Only LLMs for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08210)
*Andrew Z. Wang,Songwei Ge,Tero Karras,Ming-Yu Liu,Yogesh Balaji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models, finding that layer-normalized averaging of embeddings outperforms traditional last-layer embeddings and T5 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models rely on outdated text encoders like T5 and CLIP, prompting investigation into modern LLMs for improved performance.

Method: A standardized pipeline trains 27 models with 12 text encoders, analyzing embedding extraction methods, LLM variants, and sizes.

Result: Layer-normalized averaging of embeddings enhances alignment with complex prompts, outperforming T5 and last-layer embeddings.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs, with optimized conditioning, improve text-to-image generation, especially for complex prompts and visio-linguistic reasoning.

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

*Ioannis Iakovidis,Zahra Kalantari,Amir Hossein Payberah,Fernando Jaramillo,Francisco Pena Escobar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised training with deep clustering and negative sampling improves wetland segmentation in radar images without manual annotations, outperforming supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of satellite images for wetland monitoring is slow and expensive, prompting the need for self-supervised methods.

Method: Combines deep clustering and negative sampling for self-supervised training, with an ensemble approach to reduce variance.

Result: Achieves a 0.02 improvement in Intersection Over Union (IoU) over a fully-supervised model.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ensemble models are effective for wetland segmentation, reducing reliance on costly annotations.

Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite
images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the
remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models
require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow
and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training
methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In
this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to
train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water
from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement
an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance.
Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our
ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the
Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

*Octave Mariotti,Zhipeng Du,Yash Bhalgat,Oisin Mac Aodha,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for learning dense semantic correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a 3D canonical space, outperforming supervised baselines and showing unsupervised methods generalize better across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised semantic correspondence methods are limited by sparse keypoint annotations and poor generalization. The paper aims to improve dense correspondence learning without explicit 3D supervision.

Method: The approach lifts 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation, creating a continuous manifold for object geometry. It also introduces SPair-U, an extended dataset with new annotations.

Result: The model outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints and shows unsupervised methods generalize better across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively learns robust dense correspondences without 3D supervision, demonstrating superior generalization compared to supervised approaches.

Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful
matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how
recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize
beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint
detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense
correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using
monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical
manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D
supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an
extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess
generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly
outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its
effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised
baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different
datasets.

*Vishaal Udandarao,Mehdi Cherti,Shyamgopal Karthik,Jenia Jitsev,Samuel Albanie,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques 17 benchmarks for vision-language models (VLMs), revealing biases and flaws in their design, and suggests improvements for more robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of current benchmarks in measuring compositional understanding in VLMs and identify their shortcomings.

Method: Analyzed 17 benchmarks, examining data sources, curation procedures, and biases. Compared performance of blind heuristics (e.g., token-length) with CLIP models.

Result: Found benchmarks ineffective due to inherent biases and distribution asymmetry between positive/negative examples. Blind heuristics matched CLIP performance.

Conclusion: Proposed recommendations for designing more robust benchmarks to avoid simple attacks and better measure compositional understanding.

Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for
measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data
source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative
images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We
find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language
model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not
effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the
underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative
images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate
these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust
vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less
prone to such simple attacks.

### [14] [Highly Compressed Tokenizer Can Generate Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08257)
*L. Lao Beyer,T. Li,X. Chen,S. Karaman,K. He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 1D image tokenizers compress images into 1D sequences, enabling fine-grained editing and generation via simple token manipulations and gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the expressivity and capabilities of 1D image tokenizers for image editing and generation without training generative models.

Method: Uses a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization for compression, enabling heuristic token manipulations and gradient-based optimization with plug-and-play loss functions (e.g., reconstruction, CLIP similarity).

Result: Demonstrates fine-grained image editing (appearance/semantic transfer) and generation (inpainting, text-guided editing) without training generative models.

Conclusion: 1D tokenizers offer a lightweight, flexible approach for image manipulation and generation, bypassing the need for complex generative models.

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged
tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly
compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find
that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector
quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through
heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude
manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent
representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring
appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D
tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging
gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss
functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is
demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can
generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any
generative model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage is an audio-to-video foundation model that generates realistic, expressive video from audio input, outperforming existing methods in quality and generality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods either ignore sound or focus on narrow domains, lacking a general-purpose solution for harmonious audio-visual integration.

Method: Mirage uses a unified self-attention-based training approach for audio-to-video generation, either from scratch or with existing weights.

Result: Mirage produces high-quality, believable video from audio, especially for speech, and integrates well with text-to-speech systems.

Conclusion: Mirage advances audio-to-video generation with superior quality and generality, enabling compelling multimodal outputs.

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

*Nhat Thanh Tran,Fanghui Xue,Shuai Zhang,Jiancheng Lyu,Yunling Zheng,Yingyong Qi,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEMA introduces a scalable and efficient attention mechanism for vision tasks, avoiding dispersion and outperforming linear attention and Mamba models on Imagenet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of vanilla full attention (quadratic complexity) and linear attention (lack of focus) in vision tasks.

Method: Design SEMA using token localization to prevent dispersion and arithmetic averaging for global attention, inspired by Mamba.

Result: SEMA outperforms linear attention and recent vision Mamba models on Imagenet-1k, especially at larger image scales.

Conclusion: SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative for vision tasks, combining focus and global attention properties.

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic
computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the
inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for
computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized
attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention
within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses,
that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal
weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent
development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba
like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and
maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic
averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on
Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and
effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision
Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter
sizes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for collecting high-quality reflection datasets and presents the OpenRR-1k dataset, which improves reflection removal robustness in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reflection removal techniques lack high-quality in-the-wild datasets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a convenient, cost-effective, and scalable paradigm to collect perfectly aligned, diverse, and high-quality reflection-transmission image pairs, resulting in the OpenRR-1k dataset.

Result: The OpenRR-1k dataset, containing 1,000 image pairs, enhances reflection removal robustness in challenging real-world environments, as validated by benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: The OpenRR-1k dataset addresses the lack of high-quality reflection datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in reflection removal performance.

Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and
computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the
lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our
approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the
collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent
natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a
Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which
contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in
the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and
benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

*Guandong Li,Mengxia Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STNet, a novel network architecture, addresses hyperspectral image classification challenges by decoupling spatial-spectral attention and using gating mechanisms, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like high-dimensional data, sparse ground objects, and spectral redundancy in hyperspectral image classification lead to overfitting and limited generalization.

Method: STNet introduces a Spatial-Spectral Transformer module with decoupled attention and dual gating mechanisms for adaptive feature fusion and transformation.

Result: STNet shows superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, reducing overfitting and enhancing feature extraction.

Conclusion: STNet effectively improves hyperspectral image classification without increasing network complexity, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image
classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground
objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification
overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract
and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called
STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its
Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling
of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information
in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent
regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention
fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This
characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing
overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances
model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets,
outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

*Yuto Kase,Kai Ishibe,Ryoma Yasuda,Yudai Washida,Sakiko Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time method using event cameras to locate tennis ball impact on rackets, addressing limitations of high-speed cameras like memory use and manual digitization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed cameras for measuring impact location in tennis are memory-intensive and time-consuming, limiting prolonged performance analysis.

Method: Uses event cameras to detect brightness changes efficiently. Combines conventional computer vision with event-based processing (PATS) to identify swing time, impact timing, and ball/racket contours.

Result: Experimental results met permissible accuracy for performance measurement, with computation time suitable for real-time use.

Conclusion: The method enables continuous, real-time monitoring of tennis performance with lower memory use and higher efficiency.

Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is
important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in
personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the
impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged
scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming
and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively
capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's
performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the
racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure
brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed
motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to
continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method
consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,
and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are
utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at
impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results
of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis
players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for
real-time applications.

### [20] [How Much To Guide: Revisiting Adaptive Guidance in Classifier-Free Guidance Text-to-Vision Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08351)
*Huixuan Zhang,Junzhe Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Step AG, a simple adaptive guidance strategy for diffusion models, reducing computational costs by 20-30% while maintaining image quality and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance in text-to-vision diffusion models doubles computational steps, increasing costs. Existing adaptive guidance lacks robustness and general applicability.

Method: Introduces Step AG, restricting classifier-free guidance to early denoising steps, validated across models and settings.

Result: Achieves 20-30% speedup without compromising quality or alignment, consistent across models and inference steps.

Conclusion: Step AG is a universally applicable, efficient alternative to traditional classifier-free guidance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models,
classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for
conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps
for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in
significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of
adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making
previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work,
we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step
AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our
evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results
indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several
denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned
images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is
consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various
models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our
method.

*Shivang Chopra,Lingchao Mao,Gabriela Sanchez-Rodriguez,Andrew J Feola,Jing Li,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedMoE is a vision-language framework that dynamically adapts visual representation for medical imaging by using modality-specific experts, improving alignment and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks overlook modality-specific demands in medical imaging, leading to suboptimal feature extraction.

Method: MedMoE uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on report types, routing multi-scale features through specialized branches for modality-specific semantics.

Result: Empirical results show improved alignment and retrieval performance across diverse medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedMoE highlights the importance of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.

Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at
varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained
localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the
medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,
overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a
modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically
adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE
incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,
which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches
trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate
over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling
spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework
produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,
without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results
on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and
retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of
modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language
systems.

*Yanting Mei,Zhilu Zhang,Xiaohe Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DCID, a method using dual-camera fusion (ultra-wide and wide-angle images) to remove moiré patterns from images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moiré patterns degrade image quality, and existing methods struggle with large patterns. Dual-camera setups on smartphones and differing focal lengths inspire the solution.

Method: DCID integrates a lightweight ultra-wide image encoder into a demoiréing network and uses a fast two-stage alignment. A dataset of 9,000 samples is created for validation.

Result: Experiments show DCID outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the constructed real-world dataset.

Conclusion: DCID effectively removes moiré patterns by leveraging dual-camera fusion, validated by a large-scale dataset.

Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured
images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing
methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address
the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing
(DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e
removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the
two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image
generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W
image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an
efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into
an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is
present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse
mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the
dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.

TL;DR: SECOND improves VLMs by reducing object hallucination through selective and contrastive decoding of multi-scale visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from object hallucination, limiting accurate visual understanding.

Method: Proposes SECOND, which selectively integrates and contrasts multi-scale visual information in an object-centric manner.

Result: SECOND reduces hallucinations and outperforms benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-scale visual information, when prioritized and contrasted, enhances VLM performance beyond existing methods.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the
performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a
critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this
issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach
that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with
an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND
progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information,
facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these
visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual
hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical
analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of
multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting
across scales outperforms existing methods.

*Taiqin Chen,Zikun Zhou,Zheng Fang,Wenzhen Zou,Kanjun Liu,Ke Chen,Yongbing Zhang,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RadioDUN, a deep unfolding network for dense radio map estimation, integrating physical propagation models and dynamic reweighting to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for radio map estimation lack integration with physical characteristics, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The paper casts radio map estimation as a sparse signal recovery problem, decomposes it into factor optimization sub-problems, and introduces RadioDUN with a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) and shadowing loss.

Result: RadioDUN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates physical propagation models and deep learning, enhancing radio map estimation performance.

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

*Mingjie Xu,Andrew Estornell,Hongzheng Yang,Yuzhi Zhao,Zhaowei Zhu,Qi Xuan,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE introduces a quality-driven data selection pipeline for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address noisy alignments and ambiguous text in datasets, improving visual instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs rely on large-scale datasets, but noisy alignments and misleading text hinder performance. SCALE aims to enhance data quality and cross-modality alignment.

Method: SCALE uses a cross-modality framework to assign tasks, generate captions, and evaluate alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity.

Result: SCALE identifies limitations in unimodal quality assessment and shows that generated captions can unify multimodal tasks into text modality.

Conclusion: SCALE improves VLM performance by selecting high-quality data and ensuring better alignment between visual and textual content.

Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training
techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with
more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs
is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise
recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1)
noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to
misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual
content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data
quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data
selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE
integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data
entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and
task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates
the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each
entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal
quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,
which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the
lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately
generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text
multimodal task into a unified text modality.

*June Suk Choi,Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Yisol Choi,Jinwoo Shin,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG) to enhance motion dynamics in image-to-video (I2V) generation, addressing static outputs from fine-tuned T2V models. ALG improves dynamicity by 36% without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning T2V models for I2V often results in static videos due to premature exposure to high-frequency details, biasing the sampling process.

Method: ALG adaptively applies low-pass filtering to the conditioning image early in denoising to modulate frequency content.

Result: ALG boosts dynamicity by 36% (VBench-I2V) while maintaining image fidelity and text alignment.

Conclusion: ALG effectively resolves static video issues in I2V generation, enhancing motion dynamics without compromising quality.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability,
recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support
image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses
motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared
to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and
identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in
the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory
that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this,
we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model
sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising
per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency
content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early
stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly
improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image
fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG
achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant
drop in video quality or image fidelity.

*Siyuan Shen,Ziheng Wang,Xingyue Peng,Suan Xia,Ruiqian Li,Shiying Li,Jingyi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARMOT is a masked autoencoder for NLOS transient imaging, pretrained on diverse datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous NLOS transient imaging works lack learned priors from datasets, limiting their performance.

Method: MARMOT uses a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, pretrained on 500K synthesized transients via self-supervised learning with a scanning pattern mask.

Result: MARMOT shows superior efficiency in downstream tasks through direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning.

Conclusion: MARMOT advances NLOS transient imaging by leveraging pretraining and self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities
such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm
in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an
object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved
sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of
hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using
NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or
surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned
from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling
transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a
self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient
datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features
from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the
unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts
full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of
500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature
transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in
comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

*Qilin Yin,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniCaCLF, a context-aware contrastive learning framework for temporal forgery localization (TFL) in videos, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods treat it as a classification task, ignoring partial tampering in videos. TFL for small fake clips in real videos is more realistic but challenging.

Method: Proposes UniCaCLF, using supervised contrastive learning and a context-aware perception layer with heterogeneous activation and adaptive context updater to localize forged segments.

Result: UniCaCLF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five public datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses TFL challenges, enhancing forgery detection precision in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on
detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However,
these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and
ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal
forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real
videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application
scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware
contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages
supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by
means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal
forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer
that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context
updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the
discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine
instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An
efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the
limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants
in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence
to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental
results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLVTG improves video temporal grounding by combining MambaAligner for temporal modeling and LLMRefiner for semantic alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based VTG methods face issues like redundant attention and poor multi-modal alignment, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: MLVTG integrates MambaAligner (Vision Mamba blocks for temporal modeling) and LLMRefiner (frozen LLM layer for semantic alignment) to enhance localization.

Result: MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum datasets.

Conclusion: The dual alignment strategy of MLVTG effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, offering superior video temporal grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips
corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging
task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer
from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key
modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba
blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and
extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner
leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without
fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured
state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more
precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and
TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and
significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: Visual localization is difficult in dynamic environments due to lighting, weather, and moving objects disrupting appearance cues.

Method: Uses a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention and semantic supervision via neural scene representation.

Result: Outperforms existing pose regression methods in dynamic scenarios on TartanAir.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance enhances robustness in real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where
fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance
cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose
regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions.
To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines
multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach
employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric
details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to
environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with
semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding
the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural
information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments
on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression
methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes,
and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with
semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in
real-world dynamic environments.

### [31] [LiftVSR: Lifting Image Diffusion to Video Super-Resolution via Hybrid Temporal Modeling with Only 4$\times$RTX 4090s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08529)
*Xijun Wang,Xin Li,Bingchen Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiftVSR is an efficient video super-resolution framework using diffusion models, reducing computational costs while maintaining long-term coherence via hybrid temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video super-resolution methods lack temporal coherence and are computationally expensive, especially for long videos.

Method: LiftVSR combines Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for short-term modeling and Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term coherence, with an asymmetric sampling strategy to stabilize inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computational costs (4×RTX 4090 GPUs).

Conclusion: LiftVSR balances efficiency and consistency, advancing video super-resolution with practical deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by
enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal
modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually
suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational
costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for
long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that
leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$,
achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To
balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal
modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary
components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal
modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)
Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments
($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token
flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame
contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment
information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal
overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we
introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches
arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on
several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves
impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

TL;DR: TrajFlow is a flow matching-based motion prediction framework for autonomous driving, offering efficient multi-modal forecasts in a single pass, outperforming existing methods on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving under dynamic conditions requires efficient and accurate motion prediction with multi-modal forecasts.

Method: TrajFlow uses flow matching to predict multiple trajectories in one pass, employs a Plackett-Luce ranking loss for uncertainty estimation, and introduces self-conditioning training for better generalization.

Result: TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, demonstrating efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TrajFlow is effective for safety-critical autonomous driving applications, offering scalable and efficient motion prediction.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic
real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce
TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that
addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative
trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that
employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse
outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single
pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence
across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the
Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted
trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique
that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a
second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating
inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical
autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on
the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH) and the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework to explain how deep networks form human-interpretable representations, validated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI transparency and control by understanding how deep networks develop structured, human-interpretable representations, inspired by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH).

Method: Proposes ISLH and the SPP framework to analyze how concept-aligned directions in input space are amplified with depth, and validates this in VLMs.

Result: Demonstrates multimodal robustness of these representations in VLMs, linking theory to empirical evidence.

Conclusion: Advances a structured theory of representation formation, contributing to AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI
transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or
circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable
concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose
the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned
directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with
increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP)
framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear
representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on
this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these
representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical
insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of
representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI
robustness, fairness, and transparency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-branch adversarial neural network for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without calibration, achieving robust performance on unseen users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of inter-subject variability in EMG signals and impracticality of subject-specific calibration.

Method: End-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network disentangles EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios, enabling calibration-free recognition and biometric applications.

Conclusion: Offers a novel approach for cross-subject EMG recognition and highlights potential for broader biometric systems.

Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant
challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode
placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on
subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach
that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world
deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration
requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject
generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network
that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification
by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific
components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern
recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific
components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric
identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various
baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new
perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration
and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as
task-independent biometric systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IOD models struggle with performance and inference time, limiting practicality for real-world object detection.

Method: Leverages Neural Collapse for imbalanced datasets and hierarchical class label relations.

Result: Ensures competitive performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Hier-DETR addresses limitations of current IOD models, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance
improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects
frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually
learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental
Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing
models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged
inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called
Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both
efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for
imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

### [37] [Generating Vision-Language Navigation Instructions Incorporated Fine-Grained Alignment Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08566)
*Yibo Cui,Liang Xie,Yu Zhao,Jiawei Sun,Erwei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCA-NIG, a framework for generating fine-grained cross-modal annotations in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN), addressing the lack of sub-instruction and entity-level alignments in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN datasets lack fine-grained cross-modal alignments (sub-instruction and entity-level), which are crucial for accurate navigation.

Method: FCA-NIG divides trajectories into sub-trajectories, uses GLIP for landmark detection, OFA-Speaker for instruction generation, and CLIP for entity selection, creating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations.

Result: The generated FCA-R2R dataset improves performance of VLN agents like SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT, enhancing state awareness and navigation accuracy.

Conclusion: FCA-NIG effectively generates high-quality training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in VLN.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate
environments by integrating visual perception and natural language
instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of
fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily
focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting
sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate
navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose
FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation
instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this
framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories,
which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted
instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation,
and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs
with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to
form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the
FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise
sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the
performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop,
RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances
agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment
further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results
highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable
training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal
learning in complex navigation tasks.

*Chengchao Shen,Hourun Zhu,Gongfan Fang,Jianxin Wang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGMR method reduces MLP parameters in large vision transformers with minimal performance loss, achieving over 57% parameter and FLOPs reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large transformer models are computationally expensive due to MLP modules dominating parameters. DGMR aims to reduce costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) with Gram-Schmidt pruning to eliminate redundant neurons, preserving weight diversity for performance recovery.

Result: Achieves 57-71.5% parameter and FLOPs reduction with negligible performance loss, requiring only 0.06% of LAION-2B data for recovery.

Conclusion: DGMR effectively compresses large vision transformers near-losslessly, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

Motivation: Transformers are underutilized in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) despite their effectiveness for long-range dependencies. This survey aims to guide researchers in adapting Transformers for HSI.

Method: Reviewed 300+ papers, categorized stages of HSI classification pipelines (pre-processing, tokenization, feature extraction, etc.), and contrasted design choices with HSI properties.

Result: Identified challenges: scarce labeled data, spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and model explainability. Proposed solutions like public datasets and lightweight models.

Conclusion: Outlines a research agenda for next-gen HSI applications, emphasizing practical Transformer adaptations for HSI-specific needs.

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range
dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still
emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the
first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The
study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or
pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction,
multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and
contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral
properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles:
scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead,
and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda
prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models,
illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable
attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining,
or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for
next-generation HSI applications.

*Shiji Zhao,Chi Chen,Ranjie Duan,Xizhe Wang,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABSLD improves adversarial robust fairness by adjusting class-wise smoothness of teacher's soft labels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the robust fairness issue in AT and ARD, where models show uneven robustness across classes.

Method: Proposes ABSLD, which adaptively reduces error risk gaps by adjusting class-wise smoothness of soft labels using varying temperatures.

Result: ABSLD enhances robustness and fairness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ABSLD effectively mitigates robust fairness issues and is adaptable with other methods.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to
enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT,
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in
enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust
fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness
against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial
robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying
factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for
different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical
observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we
propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge
Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.
Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between
different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness
degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment
is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.
Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be
integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate
ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of
robustness and fairness.

Conclusion: The VIPriors workshop highlights the potential of model ensembles, data augmentation, and prior knowledge to improve data efficiency in Deep Learning, especially in data-deficient scenarios.

Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well.
In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which
Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by
organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep

These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for
computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training
models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed
to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of
novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data
efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of
large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data

*Joost van Dalen,Yuki M. Asano,Marc Russwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMSelect is an algorithm for visualizing multispectral images, specifically for marine debris, by selecting optimal band combinations for accurate segmentation and photo-interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine debris is hard to visualize due to compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery, and current methods rely on case-by-case band selection by experts.

Method: SAMSelect uses the Segment Anything Model to choose the best band or index combination for classification accuracy on annotated data, assuming it also aids visual interpretation.

Result: Tested on Sentinel-2 scenes, SAMSelect identified new band combinations (e.g., B8, B2) outperforming literature-based indices.

Conclusion: SAMSelect offers a practical tool for marine scientists, with open-source code provided for broader application in visual photo-interpretation.

Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel
visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use
for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in
Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to
their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these
difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains
a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a
case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect
selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification
accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its
central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most
accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for
photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine
debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets
from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously
unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which
demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We
describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository
that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation,
especially in the marine field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a targeted sampling strategy and a new surface reconstruction loss for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), improving rendering accuracy and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF variants face scalability issues in training due to uniform sampling of pixels and 3D points, limiting accuracy.

Method: Leverages implicit surface representation and models a probability density function for targeted ray sampling, along with a new surface reconstruction loss.

Result: Achieves more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially in regions of interest.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling strategy and loss function enhance current NeRF methods, offering better performance in scene rendering and reconstruction.

Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly
improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D
scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can
train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every
pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability
issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D
points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the
sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage
the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a
probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more
targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved
rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for
improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image
projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space
components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into
current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more
accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering,
especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

Conclusion: ECMNet effectively integrates CNN and Mamba, addressing their weaknesses and achieving high accuracy and efficiency in semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers
have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs
with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context

Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to
improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale
Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial
aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion
Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented
accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6%
mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets limits video-conditioned robotic learning and cross-platform generalization.

Method: RoboSwap segments robotic arms, uses an unpaired GAN for translation, blends with backgrounds, and refines with a diffusion model for coherence and realism.

Result: RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art models in structural coherence and motion consistency on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: RoboSwap provides a robust solution for generating reliable cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis
and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues
to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform
generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic
arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike
previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same
environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired
data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap
introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion
models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic
arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one
robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video
background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion
realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained
independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms
state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of
both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust
solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation, achieving the best accuracy-speed trade-off with lazy query, multi-scale grid, and cross-scale attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between detail and generalization in learning-based surface reconstruction methods, aiming for faster inference without significant performance loss.

Method: Proposes a new implicit representation with lazy query (early-stage feature extraction without query points), parallel multi-scale grid for robustness, and attention across scales for improved reconstruction.

Result: Faster than baselines at optimum resolution with marginal performance loss compared to state-of-the-art, achieving the best accuracy-speed trade-off.

Conclusion: The method offers a balanced solution for surface reconstruction, combining speed and accuracy through innovative feature extraction and multi-scale techniques.

Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for
unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning
methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that
allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized
representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but
lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation
for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum
resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the
state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key
contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to
classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed
up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to
use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel
multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise
levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can
provide improved reconstruction results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces orientation-aligned 3D object generation from single images, addressing misalignment issues in existing models. It presents Objaverse-OA, a dataset for training, and fine-tunes models to achieve consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models produce misaligned objects due to inconsistent training data, limiting usability. The goal is to generate 3D objects with consistent orientations.

Method: The authors construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 aligned 3D models, and fine-tune multi-view diffusion and 3D variational autoencoder models.

Result: The method outperforms post-hoc alignment approaches and generalizes well to unseen objects.

Conclusion: The approach enables downstream applications like zero-shot orientation estimation and efficient object rotation manipulation.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image,
guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative
models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data,
limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce
the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from
single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate
this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D
models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two
representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D
variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize
well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches.
Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object
generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via
analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

*Zhiyi Zhu,Xiaoyu Wu,Youwei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TMCCL, a model for video memorability prediction, and MWCVS, an application for video summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for video memorability prediction underutilize motion cues due to limited labeled data, and applications of memorability prediction are underexplored.

Method: Proposes TMCCL to enhance motion feature representation using text-motion cross-modal contrastive learning and MWCVS for video summarization.

Result: TMCCL achieves top performance on memorability datasets; MWCVS reduces subjectivity in video summarization.

Conclusion: The work advances video memorability prediction and demonstrates its practical utility in video summarization.

Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after
viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable.
Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict
video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The
representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase
of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper,
we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal
video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of
motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature
representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to
establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This
enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for
semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability
predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video
memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video
memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we
present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using
video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization
labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video
memorability prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Neural Physical Model (NPM) for consistent color reproduction across cameras, addressing limitations of existing methods with adaptability, low computational cost, and no need for paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring color consistency across cameras is challenging due to sensor and optic variations, and existing methods have limitations like poor adaptability or high costs.

Method: The Neural Physical Model (NPM) simulates raw images under specified illumination to estimate transformations between devices, supporting training with or without paired data.

Result: NPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB, achieving robust chromatic consistency.

Conclusion: NPM provides a lightweight, adaptable solution for color reproduction across cameras, overcoming key challenges of existing approaches.

Abstract: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential
for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in
modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and
optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor
adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical
requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping
fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight,
physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified
illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively
adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical
measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on
public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across
different sensors and optical systems.

*Wenzhuo Liu,Fei Zhu,Haiyang Guo,Longhui Wei,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve continual learning in multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5, addressing challenges like task balancing and base model degradation, achieving results comparable to multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multitask learning in models like LLaVA-1.5 faces issues like task balancing and catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning is promising but often neglects general capabilities due to overfitting.

Method: The authors introduce spectral-aware consolidation for task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization to prevent base model degradation, evaluated on continual pretraining and fine-tuning.

Result: LLaVA-c improves benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities, matching or surpassing multitask joint learning.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses continual learning challenges, offering a viable alternative to multitask learning with public code release.

Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual
understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling
strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask
learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment
of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic
forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising
alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing
capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance,
neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions,
which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but
effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware
consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization
to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific
performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments
demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance
and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that
task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass
multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS) to improve CLIP's fine-grained vision-language alignment and semantic coherence without extra modules or supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, limiting its effectiveness in dense prediction tasks. Current methods compromise semantic coherence or require additional resources.

Method: ATAS leverages self-distillation on unlabeled images to refine CLIP's vision encoder, enhancing both semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment.

Result: ATAS outperforms baseline CLIP models on open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment is crucial for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction, as demonstrated by ATAS.

Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual
concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level
understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We
identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic
coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation
methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic
coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To
overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel
approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained
alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation
levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal
self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders,
preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail
recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation
benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline
CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and
underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and
fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CanadaFireSat, a benchmark dataset for high-resolution wildfire forecasting in Canada, using multi-modal data and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The severe 2023 wildfire season in Canada highlights the need for better wildfire mitigation tools, especially high-resolution forecasting models to address climate-change-induced fire risks.

Method: The study leverages multi-modal data (Sentinel-2, MODIS, ERA5) and tests two deep learning architectures to create 100 m resolution wildfire probability maps.

Result: Multi-modal inputs outperformed single-modal ones, achieving a 60.3% F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, demonstrating high-resolution forecasting potential.

Conclusion: Multi-modal deep learning models show promise for high-resolution, continental-scale wildfire forecasting, aiding better wildfire management.

Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent
history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting
large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a
climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season
that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower
wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.
Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the
likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future
wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data
has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,
aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and
temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on
coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to
wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim
0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and
baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,
leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite
images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and
environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two
major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal
inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a
peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season
never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of
multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution
and continental scale.

Motivation: LVLMs struggle with complex visual reasoning despite their success in multimodal tasks, prompting the need for improved reasoning techniques.

Method: VReST employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore reasoning steps and a Self-Reward mechanism to evaluate step quality without extra models.

Result: VReST achieves state-of-the-art performance on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: VReST demonstrates the potential of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in
multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still
constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques.
In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances
Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms.
VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search
tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a
comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward
mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of
sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues,
all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting
methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy
of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction
for future research.

TL;DR: A motion-guided self-supervised learning framework for videos improves feature consistency and robustness by clustering dense point tracks, outperforming existing methods by 1%-6% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending dense self-supervised learning to videos is challenging due to motion dynamics, deformations, and occlusions, which existing static augmentation methods fail to address.

Method: The framework uses an off-the-shelf point tracker to extract motion trajectories, optimizes feature clustering via momentum-encoder-based optimal transport, and propagates cluster assignments for temporal coherence.

Result: The method improves state-of-the-art performance by 1%-6% on six datasets and four benchmarks, demonstrating robustness in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: Motion-guided self-supervised learning effectively addresses video representation challenges, offering improved generalization and consistency.

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel-
and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging
due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they
rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,
and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We
propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense
point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By
leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion
trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based
optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster
assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views
despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory
signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,
improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By
initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for
training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video
datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly
available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main

TL;DR: TraGraph-GS improves novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes using a trajectory graph and spatial partitioning, outperforming existing methods in PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for large-scale scene rendering struggle with generalization due to rigid spatial partitioning and Gaussian overlap issues.

Method: Proposes TraGraph-GS, using a trajectory graph for spatial partitioning, regularization for texture/distant object rendering, and progressive rendering to reduce artifacts.

Result: Achieves average PSNR improvements of 1.86 dB (aerial) and 1.62 dB (ground) over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TraGraph-GS effectively addresses challenges in large-scale scene rendering, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a
challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition
large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using
Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view
rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not
generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques
struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions
results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these
challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable
high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a
spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which
incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures
and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate
artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its
superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight
its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86
dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: Current 3DGS methods are limited by evaluations on rendered 2D views and few scenes, hindering holistic 3D understanding. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a benchmark assessing three 3DGS method groups (per-scene optimization-based, optimization-free, and generalizable) on 1060 scenes across multiple datasets. Introduces GaussianWorld-49K, a diverse 3DGS dataset.

Result: The generalizable paradigm outperforms others, enabling fast inference on novel scenes and superior segmentation. GaussianWorld-49K enhances performance by leveraging data priors.

Conclusion: The benchmark and dataset advance generalizable 3DGS research, with public release to accelerate progress in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient
encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding
language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene
understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three
main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene
optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are
evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close
to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D
understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark
that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D
space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor
dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable
paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast
feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation
performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS
dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from
multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could
harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made

TL;DR: The paper proposes an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth using 3D vascular surface data, improving personalized monitoring over current diameter-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAA monitoring relies on maximum diameter, ignoring 3D shape complexities, leading to potentially unfit surveillance intervals. Personalized growth predictions could enhance monitoring.

Method: An SE(3)-symmetric transformer model predicts AAA growth directly on vascular surfaces enriched with local, multi-physical features, preserving anatomical structure. Trained on 113 CTA scans from 24 patients.

Result: Median diameter error of 1.18 mm in growth prediction; 93% accuracy in identifying eligibility for elective repair within two years. Validated on an external dataset.

Conclusion: Local directional AAA growth prediction from vascular surfaces is feasible and may improve personalized surveillance strategies.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the
abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current
clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA
diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet
these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on
the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the
complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized
intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve
monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model
to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with
local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have
parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular
surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using
a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24
AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model
predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of
1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a
patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).
Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set
consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our
results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular
surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InceptionNeXt's limitations in capturing spatial dependencies and global context modeling inspired the development of InceptionMamba.

Method: Replaces one-dimensional strip convolutions with orthogonal band convolutions and introduces a bottleneck Mamba module for global context modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification and downstream tasks with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: InceptionMamba addresses InceptionNeXt's shortcomings and outperforms it, offering a promising backbone architecture.

Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown
excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream
tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it
suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different
dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood.
Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are
detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in
this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip
convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba
to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling
can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced
cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive
evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the
proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior
parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-MTDF, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework for remote sensing, leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to bridge distribution gaps and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing requires costly annotations. Semi-supervised methods face distribution mismatches, prompting the use of VFMs for robust generalization.

Method: RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2, CLIP) as teachers, using feature-level distillation and fusion to enhance student model performance.

Result: RS-MTDF achieves state-of-the-art results on ISPRS Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe datasets, outperforming existing methods in various label ratios and semantic categories.

Conclusion: Multi-teacher VFM guidance significantly enhances generalization and semantic understanding in remote sensing segmentation, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various
applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale,
high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and
time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a
promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS
methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited
labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.
We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and
diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can
effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for
SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and
Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge
embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.
Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and
CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student
features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative
power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.
Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS
Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing
approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in
the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of
multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and
semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

### [61] [Gaussian2Scene: 3D Scene Representation Learning via Self-supervised Learning with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08777)
*Keyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian2Scene is a novel SSL framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient and explicit 3D scene pre-training, outperforming existing methods in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for point cloud pre-training rely on implicit scene representations and 2D reconstruction, limiting geometric understanding and computational efficiency.

Method: Gaussian2Scene employs a two-stage training strategy: a dual-branch masked autoencoder for 2D/3D representations, followed by supervised learning with reconstructed point clouds and Gaussian primitives.

Result: The framework shows consistent improvements in downstream 3D object detection tasks.

Conclusion: Gaussian2Scene enhances geometric understanding and computational efficiency, making it a superior choice for scene-level SSL.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a
cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from
large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often
incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D
images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This
strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model
to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches
are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory
demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in
2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL
framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the
computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct
3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the
backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training
strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D
and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with
reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric
locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process
reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection
tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for Landsat data limits progress in Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM).

Method: Three benchmarks (EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, LC100-L) are adapted from existing datasets, with standardized evaluation methods and SSL4EO-L pretrained models.

Result: SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs outperform ImageNet, with gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench provides a foundation for evaluating GFMs, demonstrating the superiority of SSL4EO-L pretraining for Landsat imagery.

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth
imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress
towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and

*Jongyub Seok,Chanjin Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HomographyAD is a novel deep anomaly detection method for industrial datasets, addressing misalignment issues in real-world scenarios by using homography estimation and self-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods perform well only on fully-aligned datasets, unlike real-world industrial environments.

Method: Proposes HomographyAD: input alignment via deep homography estimation, self homography learning for fine-tuning, and anomaly detection via feature distance.

Result: Shows performance enhancement when applied to various existing AD approaches.

Conclusion: HomographyAD effectively addresses misalignment in industrial anomaly detection, improving performance.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data,
which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing
facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for
industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances.
However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good
performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial
environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep
anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which
is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first
suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method.
In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn
additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly
detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from
the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed
method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement
through extensive experiments.

### [64] [A PDE-Based Image Dehazing Method via Atmospheric Scattering Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08793)
*Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel PDE framework for single-image dehazing integrates atmospheric scattering, nonlocal regularization, and dark channel prior, proving existence/uniqueness of solutions and demonstrating promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve single-image dehazing by combining physical models (atmospheric scattering) with mathematical techniques (PDEs, nonlocal regularization) for better performance and generalizability.

Method: Proposes an improved PDE with edge-preserving diffusion, adaptive regularization, and Gaussian convolution. Uses Lax-Milgram theorem for theoretical guarantees and implements a GPU-accelerated fixed-point iteration.

Result: The method shows promising dehazing performance and potential for integration into deep learning models.

Conclusion: The proposed PDE framework is effective for single-image dehazing and can be extended to deep model paradigms.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for
single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with
nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[
-\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \]
where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving
diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and
$\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map
$t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$
using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration
scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results
demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be
generalized to the deep model paradigm.

*Zhiyuan Ma,Ruixun Liu,Sixian Liu,Jianjun Li,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Discretized-RF introduces momentum fields to improve diversity and multi-scale noise modeling in rectified flow models by discretizing straight paths into variable velocity sub-paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address diversity and multi-scale noise modeling concerns in rectified flow models, which are limited by straight-line paths.

Method: Discretize straight paths into variable velocity sub-paths (momentum fields) and introduce noise on velocity to improve diversity.

Result: Produces diverse and efficient trajectories, consistently generating high-quality and diverse results.

Conclusion: Discretized-RF enhances rectified flow models by expanding the search space and improving noise modeling, leading to better performance.

Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art
among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in
straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a
series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line
connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,
and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,
which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling
space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow
only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two
distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present
Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow
models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random
velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path
into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')
to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution
$p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly
superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the
sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and
multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several
representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by
sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse
and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in HOI video generation, such as reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization, and restricted accessibility.

Method: Uses sparse, decoupled motion guidance and a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT) with dual input space for appearance and motion signals. Includes a HOI adapter and facial cross-attention adapter for efficient training and lip synchronization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision.

Conclusion: Demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly interface.

Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation
-- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to
novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce
HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework.
HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise
inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and
motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer
(MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally
consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we
integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT
weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a
facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in
interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally,
HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and
interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiSin is a diffusion-based framework for efficient high-resolution sinogram inpainting, reducing memory and computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing high-frequency projections in computed tomography can cause artifacts and diagnostic errors, necessitating robust inpainting methods.

Method: HiSin uses resolution-guided progressive inference, frequency-aware patch skipping, and structure-adaptive step allocation for memory-efficient inpainting.

Result: HiSin reduces peak memory usage by 31.25% and inference time by 18.15% without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSin effectively addresses the limitations of diffusion models for high-resolution sinogram inpainting, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography
reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible
artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task
due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their
application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and
computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel
diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via
resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global
structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small
patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates
frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce
redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory
usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains
inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.

Motivation: Current vision-language models lack nuanced spatiotemporal understanding for thorough video analysis.

Method: Developed Video-CoT dataset with 192,000 question-answer pairs and 23,000 CoT-annotated samples, plus a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show VLMs struggle with spatiotemporal tasks, highlighting the dataset's value.

Conclusion: Video-CoT advances research in video comprehension and supports future intelligent systems.

Abstract: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging

a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video
comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing
these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation
metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant
challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the
difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT
dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding
and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video
analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to
encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study quantifies cultural alignment in text-to-image (T2I) models, revealing significant failures in meeting explicit (68%) and implicit (49%) cultural expectations. It introduces CulturalFrames, a benchmark for evaluation, and highlights poor correlation of existing metrics with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about T2I models' ability to represent diverse cultural contexts accurately drive the need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Introduces CulturalFrames, a benchmark with 983 prompts, 3637 images from 4 T2I models, and 10k human annotations across 10 countries and 5 domains.

Result: T2I models miss cultural expectations 44% of the time, with explicit failures at 68% and implicit at 49%. Existing metrics poorly correlate with human judgments.

Conclusion: The study identifies gaps in cultural representation, urging development of culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methods.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual
content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent
diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to
systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with
respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this
end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human
evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10
countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,
3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over
10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet
the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging
explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are
missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit
expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while
implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human
judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.
Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable
directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation
methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual contouring in medical ultrasonography is labor-intensive and inconsistent, while vision-language models face challenges adapting to medical imaging.

Method: Fine-tuning vision-language models using a large language model as a text refiner, with specialized adaptation strategies and task-driven heads.

Result: The method improves performance on six ultrasound datasets for segmentation and classification, surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between natural and medical imaging domains, advancing ultrasound image analysis.

Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining
superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It
employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the
internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of
interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and
often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals.
Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer
vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image
analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences
between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome
these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language
foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for
vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text
refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two
tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our
method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation
models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing
state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models. The source code of

Result: Improves PCC by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% for highly expressed, variable, and marker genes, respectively; preserves gene-gene correlations.

Conclusion: The method enhances gene expression prediction, works with limited samples, and shows promise for cancer tissue localization.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels
at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis
and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into
resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high
cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain
challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based
deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from
whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets
demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes,
highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26%
respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene
correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our
method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamSplat is a feed-forward framework for real-time 3D reconstruction from uncalibrated videos, addressing challenges like dynamic scene modeling and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle uncalibrated inputs, dynamic scene evolution, and long-term stability efficiently.

Method: Uses probabilistic sampling for 3DGS position prediction and a bidirectional deformation field for dynamic modeling.

Result: Outperforms prior works in reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, supporting online reconstruction of long videos.

Conclusion: StreamSplat offers a robust, efficient solution for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from uncalibrated videos.

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: DiscoVLA reduces discrepancies in vision, language, and alignment for video-text retrieval, outperforming prior methods by 1.5% in R@1 on MSRVTT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting CLIP to video-text retrieval focus only on vision, neglecting language and alignment discrepancies.

Method: DiscoVLA integrates image-video features, generates pseudo image captions, and uses image-to-video alignment distillation.

Result: Achieves 50.5% R@1 on MSRVTT, a 1.5% improvement over previous methods.

Conclusion: DiscoVLA effectively addresses all three discrepancies, enhancing video-text retrieval performance.

Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP
for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused
on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands
comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge
in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and
alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting
language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in
Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all
three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to
integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both
vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image
captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment
discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which
leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In
particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous
methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is

Method: Proposes a training-free PoE framework using Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to sample from the product distribution across heterogeneous experts.

Result: Demonstrates practical benefits in image and video synthesis, offering better controllability and flexible user interfaces for visual generation.

Conclusion: The PoE framework effectively combines diverse knowledge sources, outperforming monolithic methods in controllability and user flexibility for visual synthesis.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product

from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WetCat is the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos designed for automated skill assessment, addressing gaps in traditional manual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wetlab training relies on manual evaluations, which are inefficient and subjective. Computer vision can enhance objectivity and efficiency in surgical education.

Method: WetCat includes high-resolution videos of trainee-performed surgeries on artificial eyes, with detailed phase annotations and semantic segmentations for key phases like capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification.

Result: The dataset supports AI-driven skill assessment tools aligned with clinical standards, improving surgical education.

Conclusion: WetCat advances objective, scalable surgical training and sets a benchmark for automated skill assessment in ophthalmology.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab
environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in
ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual
performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often
subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising
avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and
objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic
surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or
isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in
controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat,
the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for
automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of
surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive
phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures.
These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment
during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to
standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these
essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven
evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a
strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets

TL;DR: MIRAGE is a multimodal foundation model for analyzing OCT and SLO images, outperforming existing models in classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current AI models in ophthalmology, which require extensive annotation and underperform on unseen data, by leveraging foundation models.

Method: Proposes MIRAGE, a multimodal foundation model for OCT and SLO image analysis, and introduces a new evaluation benchmark.

Result: MIRAGE outperforms general and specialized foundation models and segmentation methods in classification and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MIRAGE is a robust basis for developing AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting
clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography
(OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and
existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation
models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown
promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for
ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and
focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel
multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO)
images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO
classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and
specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in
both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the
development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE
and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:

### [77] [Hyperbolic Dual Feature Augmentation for Open-Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08906)
*Peilin Yu,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Xiaomeng Fan,Shuo Yang,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment learning, enhancing performance for both seen and unseen classes using neural ODEs and meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic feature augmentation is limited to closed environments with fixed classes, lacking adaptability for open-environment tasks.

Method: Proposes a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method using neural ODEs and meta-learning, with a regularizer to preserve hierarchical structures and a derived loss upper bound.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance in five open-environment tasks, including class-incremental learning and zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment settings.

Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing
an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms
with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to
closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen
classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we
propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment,
which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic
space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for
efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation
module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both
seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the
latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also
derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to
train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks:
class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning,
zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in
open-environment.

*Jiajun Li,Yue Ma,Xinyu Zhang,Qingyan Wei,Songhua Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework for accelerating Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models by addressing step and unconditional branch redundancies, achieving significant speedups without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency components in VAR models contribute disproportionately to latency, but the computational redundancies in these steps are underexplored. The paper aims to analyze and mitigate these inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose automatic step-skipping for step redundancy and unconditional branch replacement for branch redundancy. SkipVAR dynamically selects the best strategy per sample using frequency information.

Result: SkipVAR achieves up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on GenEval, maintaining high quality (0.88 average SSIM).

Conclusion: Frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration is effective for scalable autoregressive image generation, as demonstrated by SkipVAR.

Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that
high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute
disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational
redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In
this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and
identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional
branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic
step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to
improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the
information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.
Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a
technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.
Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies
significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,
a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically
select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate
the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark
datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments
show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall
acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model
quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and

*Ananthu Aniraj,Cassio F. Dantas,Dino Ienco,Diego Marcos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage attention-based method uses binary masks to focus on relevant image regions, improving robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Context can bias object perception, especially in out-of-distribution backgrounds, while many tasks require identifying relevant regions.

Method: A two-stage framework: stage 1 identifies task-relevant regions, and stage 2 uses attention masks to focus on these regions, trained jointly for refinement.

Result: Significant improvement in robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances context use and focused analysis, enhancing object-centric task performance.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention
masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction.
Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased
representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution
backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require
identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this
conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image
to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2
leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these
regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious
information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage
1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and
out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a search-based method using MCTS to elicit hidden reasoning in non-reasoning VLMs without additional training, showing consistent improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether non-reasoning VLMs can produce long reasoning traces without retraining, leveraging search mechanisms.

Method: Uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm to inject subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream.

Result: Achieves a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, with a notable 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Conclusion: Framing reasoning as a search process can enhance non-reasoning VLMs, demonstrating potential without additional training.

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the
possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought
reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via
distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning
models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply
abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden
knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training
or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer
pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a
search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader
inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented
knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We
evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent
improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on
MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Conclusion: OmniBench and OmniEval provide scalable, automated solutions for benchmarking and evaluating MLLM-based virtual agents, paving the way for future advancements.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual
agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks
face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity,
extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of
multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce
OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an
automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through
subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on
the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework
that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive
tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k
graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance
rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently
guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional
evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their
performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future
advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSS, a semi-supervised learning method leveraging SAM-2's feature extraction to enhance medical image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of efficiently using unlabeled medical data while reducing reliance on costly pixel-level annotations.

Method: Introduces SSS, combining SAM-2's features with a Discriminative Feature Enhancement mechanism and a prompt generator for unlabeled data.

Result: Achieves a 53.15 Dice score on BHSD, outperforming previous methods by +3.65.

Conclusion: SSS demonstrates superior performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, validated on ACDC and BHSD datasets.

Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level
annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by
facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of
fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction
in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models
(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised
SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction
capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus
effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image
segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong"
consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative
Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature
discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across
multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across
multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the
features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a
prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a
Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,
fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical
image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably,
SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A ViT model pretrained on visible imagery is adapted for cross-spectral body recognition, focusing on encoding camera information for improved performance. The study also explores occlusions in VI-ReID using a diverse dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-spectral body recognition by adapting ViTs and addressing the underexplored issue of occlusions in VI-ReID.

Method: Integrates Side Information Embedding (SIE) to encode domain and camera information, and evaluates performance on datasets like LLCM and IJB-MDF.

Result: Encoding only camera information achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLCM. The study also highlights the impact of range-induced occlusions.

Conclusion: Camera information encoding is crucial for cross-spectral matching, and occlusions in VI-ReID require further exploration.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a
wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this
work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the
challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching
images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT
architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond
traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side
Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and
camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our
results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly
incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in
visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in
visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because
existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly
feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the
impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain
Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared
images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral
evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEE, a unified method for Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS), leveraging SAM for pseudo-label generation and a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module to address incomplete supervision and intrinsic similarity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISCOS is challenging due to incomplete supervision from weak/semi-annotations and intrinsic similarities between concealed objects and backgrounds. Existing methods lack a unified solution.

Method: Proposes SEE, a mean-teacher framework using SAM for pseudo-label generation, strategies for pseudo-label quality control, and a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module for segmentation coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISCOS tasks and can enhance existing models as a plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: SEE effectively addresses ISCOS challenges, offering robust training and improved segmentation performance.

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Motivation: Small object detection lags behind large objects, posing a key challenge in computer vision.

Method: Uses Fast AutoAugment to find optimal data augmentation policies for small objects.

Result: 20% performance boost on the DOTA dataset.

Conclusion: Optimal data augmentation via Fast AutoAugment effectively enhances small object detection.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an
optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed
method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack diversity and scale for real-world object compositing tasks.

Method: ORIDa includes two data types: factual-counterfactual sets (5 images per scene) and factual-only scenes (single image per context).

Result: ORIDa is the first dataset of its scale and complexity for real-world image composition.

Conclusion: ORIDa advances research in object compositing by providing a comprehensive, real-captured dataset.

Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of
diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the
rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and
scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce
ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale,
real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique
objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa
has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The
factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in
different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background)
image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The
factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific
context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the
first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world
image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of
ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAM is a training-free framework for open-world object labeling, using LLMs and CLIP to generate and refine labels for unknown objects without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of predefined categories in object detection models for open-world scenarios.

Method: Leverages LLMs for contextual label generation and CLIP for visual embeddings, constructs an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR), and uses frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking for label assignment. Includes a self-refinement loop for consistency.

Result: Effectively annotates novel categories on COCO and PASCAL datasets without fine-tuning or retraining.

Conclusion: ADAM provides a robust, unsupervised solution for open-world object labeling.

Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting
their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome
this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model,
a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown
objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene.
These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an
Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category
supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually
similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and
cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance
consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository
labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority
re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate
that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and
contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

*Longyu Yang,Ping Hu,Lu Zhang,Jun Liu,Yap-Peng Tan,Heng Tao Shen,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework to improve range-view LiDAR segmentation robustness in adverse weather by separating geometric and reflectance processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Range-view LiDAR segmentation struggles with generalization in severe weather, limiting real-world reliability.

Method: A modular framework with two branches (GAS for geometric noise, RDC for reflectance correction) is introduced, fusing features for segmentation.

Result: The method enhances generalization to adverse weather with minimal overhead, validated across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is practical and effective for real-world LiDAR segmentation in harsh conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia
experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due
to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time
deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather
conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world
environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that
affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather.
To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework
that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing
models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view
networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance
intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS)
module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a
Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance
distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The
processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation
pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse
weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective
solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALTA improves medical vision-language alignment by adapting pretrained vision models from masked record modeling, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cross-modal contrastive learning methods have suboptimal visual representation, while masked modeling excels in visual representation but struggles with cross-modal matching. ALTA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ALTA adapts pretrained vision models from masked record modeling, using only 8% of trainable parameters and less than 1/5 computational consumption. It also integrates temporal-multiview radiograph inputs for better alignment.

Result: ALTA outperforms counterparts by over 4% in text-to-image accuracy and ~6% in image-to-text retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: ALTA efficiently aligns vision and language in medical tasks, enhancing both modalities' understanding while reducing resource usage.

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

### [90] [Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991)
*Anudeep Das,Gurjot Singh,Prach Chantasantitam,N. Asokan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current concept replacement techniques (CRTs) in diffusion-based models, showing their failure in image-to-image (I2I) scenarios, and introduces AntiMirror, a targeted editing method for better effectiveness and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning generative models to avoid unacceptable content remains challenging, especially in emerging I2I settings where existing CRTs fail.

Method: Uses an I2I model to test CRTs, identifies their shortcomings, and proposes AntiMirror for targeted editing.

Result: Existing CRTs don't erase unacceptable concepts in I2I models, highlighting a gap. AntiMirror shows promise in addressing this.

Conclusion: Targeted editing techniques like AntiMirror are needed for effective and faithful concept replacement in generative models.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models,
have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid
generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted
content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept
replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to
"erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have
started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt
as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are
known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model
to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact
erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in
emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted
concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy
between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing
unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs
to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected
fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of
targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.
We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.

*Fabian Immel,Jan-Hendrik Pauls,Richard Fehler,Frank Bieder,Jonas Merkert,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDTagNet enhances online HD map construction by leveraging SD maps and NLP-derived features, improving far-range detection accuracy by up to 45%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High maintenance costs of HD maps limit scalability, and existing online methods are constrained by sensor range. SD maps offer a cost-effective prior.

Method: SDTagNet integrates polyline SD map data with textual annotations and introduces a point-level encoder with orthogonal element identifiers.

Result: Boosts performance by up to +5.9 mAP (45%) over no-prior methods and +3.2 mAP (20%) over prior SD map methods.

Conclusion: SDTagNet effectively utilizes SD maps and NLP features to improve HD map construction, offering scalable and accurate solutions for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information
to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but
their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.
This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which
generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are
inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To
overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches
have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are
significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map
construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD
maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach
introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we
incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but
additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this
way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the
dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,
we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element
identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on
Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up
to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP
(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained MIL models outperform scratch-trained ones in computational pathology, even across different organs, and pancancer pretraining enhances generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of understanding about MIL model transferability in computational pathology, especially with small datasets.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 11 MIL models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction.

Result: Pretrained MIL models consistently outperform scratch-trained models, with pancancer pretraining showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with MIL models is highly adaptable and beneficial for computational pathology, supported by a standardized resource.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational
pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings
from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly
supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and
conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address
data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of
pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for
morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that
pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target
task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover,
pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs
and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less
pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL
models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost
performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the
implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on
popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab

### [93] [DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09024)
*Felix Wagner,Pramit Saha,Harry Anthony,J. Alison Noble,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in medical imaging, enabling secure comparison of test and training data without sharing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe ML deployment requires OOD detection, but existing methods either discard training data or assume centralized storage, which is impractical due to size, privacy, or proprietary constraints.

Method: Proposes DIsoN, a framework that quantifies separation difficulty between test and training data via binary classification, exchanging only model parameters to avoid data-sharing. Extends DIsoN with class-conditioning for targeted comparisons.

Result: Evaluated on four medical imaging datasets across 12 tasks, DIsoN outperforms existing methods while maintaining data privacy.

Conclusion: DIsoN enables secure, decentralized OOD detection, offering a new service for ML developers to provide remote training data utilization.

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon

*Runqian Wang,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dispersive Loss, a plug-and-play regularizer for diffusion models that improves performance by dispersing internal representations without needing positive sample pairs or additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning by enhancing diffusion models with explicit regularization.

Method: Proposes Dispersive Loss, a self-contained regularizer that disperses hidden representations without interfering with regression-based sampling.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements on ImageNet across various models compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss effectively enhances diffusion models, offering a minimalist and resource-efficient solution.

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between accuracy and diversity in SLAM benchmarks by providing a dataset with precise camera poses and diverse scenarios.

Method: Uses a ground truth collection framework with calibration boards and a 360-camera, collecting synchronized monocular/stereo RGB and IMU data. Introduces a scene scale-aware metric and a Novel View Synthesis benchmark.

Result: A large-scale dataset (Princeton365) with accurate camera poses, diverse scenarios, and new evaluation metrics for SLAM and NVS.

Conclusion: Princeton365 enhances SLAM and NVS research by offering diverse data, precise ground truth, and improved evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We introduce Princeton365, a large-scale diverse dataset of 365 videos with
accurate camera pose. Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data
diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth
collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We
collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular
and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene
scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by
the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new
metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across
scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE),
allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also
propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not
covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with
360-degree camera trajectories. Please visit

### [96] [Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040)
*Dianyi Wang,Wei Song,Yikun Wang,Siyuan Wang,Kaicheng Yu,Zhongyu Wei,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVR introduces autoregressive semantic visual reconstruction to jointly learn visual and textual modalities, improving multimodal understanding without raw image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs overlook fine-grained visual details and struggle with vision-centric content, relying heavily on textual captions.

Method: ASVR uses autoregressive semantic reconstruction of images within a unified framework, avoiding raw visual appearance reconstruction.

Result: ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% across 14 benchmarks, showing stable gains with discrete semantic tokens.

Conclusion: Autoregressive semantic reconstruction enhances multimodal understanding, outperforming raw visual reconstruction.

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cosmos-Drive-Dreams, a synthetic data generation pipeline for creating challenging driving scenarios to aid AV training, addressing data scarcity and edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data collection for AVs is costly and struggles with rare edge cases, which are crucial for training and testing.

Method: The pipeline uses Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models derived from NVIDIA Cosmos, to generate controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view driving videos.

Result: The generated data improves handling of long-tail distributions and enhances performance in tasks like 3D lane/object detection and policy learning.

Conclusion: The open-sourced pipeline and tools provide a scalable solution for generating diverse, high-quality synthetic driving data.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI
systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is
especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role
in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline
that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such
as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is
Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation
model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity,
multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We
showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale
the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and
challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data
helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization
in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving
policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights
through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagCache introduces a magnitude-aware caching strategy for video diffusion models, achieving significant speedups without compromising visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants, risking inconsistent outputs and requiring extensive calibration.

Method: Leverages a unified magnitude law to adaptively skip unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy.

Result: MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, with superior visual fidelity.

Conclusion: MagCache outperforms existing methods in efficiency and quality metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) under comparable computational budgets.

Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on
uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse
cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with
curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific
overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a
unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts.
Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases
monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several
steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache)
that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism
and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of
curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for
calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x
speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior
visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM,
and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

TL;DR: Cognitive Weave is a novel memory framework for LLMs, using a spatio-temporal resonance graph to enhance learning, reasoning, and adaptation, outperforming existing methods by 34% in task completion and 42% in query latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory systems for LLMs lack flexibility, temporal awareness, and higher-level insight synthesis, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic tasks.

Method: Introduces a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG) with insight particles (IPs) and a semantic oracle interface (SOI) for dynamic enrichment and relational structuring.

Result: Achieves 34% better task completion and 42% lower query latency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Cognitive Weave significantly advances LLM memory systems, with ethical considerations and future research directions highlighted.

Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates
memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous
learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems
often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal
awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw
interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory
framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph
(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles
(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and
situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs
are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving
knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive
refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of
insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived
from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental
results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing
approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering
scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable
34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean
query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this
paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory
systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines
promising future research trajectories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle complex industrial SOPs, revealing significant performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex, structured workflows like SOPs, lacking public benchmarks for such tasks.

Method: Developed a synthetic data generation framework for realistic SOPs and created SOP-Bench with 1,800 tasks across 10 domains. Evaluated Function-Calling and ReAct Agents.

Result: Average success rates were 27% and 48%, with incorrect tool usage near 100% in larger tool registries.

Conclusion: Highlights the gap in LLMs' SOP automation capabilities and the need for domain-specific benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning
and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex,
long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.
Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the
complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we
present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data
generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously
test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.
Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800
tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and
human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent
architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing
average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the
tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools
nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between
current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world
SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the
need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before
deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at
http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the
prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new
domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench
with SOPs from their industrial domains.

Motivation: The exponential growth in ML manuscript submissions is overwhelming human reviewers, risking review quality and consistency. AI assistance is seen as a solution to maintain integrity and scalability.

Method: Proposes leveraging LLMs for tasks like factual verification, reviewer guidance, author assistance, and AC support, requiring structured peer review data.

Result: Outlines a research agenda to develop and validate AI assistants, addressing technical and ethical challenges.

Conclusion: Calls for proactive community efforts to integrate AI into peer review, ensuring scalability while upholding high standards.

Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML),
is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions
to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite
capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality,
consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted
peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We
advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated
collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose
specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer
performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in
decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems
hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer
review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative
experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss
significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to
proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and
scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer

Motivation: To handle durations and deadlines in ASP while maintaining scalability despite fine-grained timing constraints.

Method: Extends ASP with difference constraints to manage time-related aspects externally, decoupling metric ASP from time granularity.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates quantitative temporal constraints into ASP without compromising scalability.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and
deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with
fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's
grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with
difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle
time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP
from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by
time precision.

TL;DR: AstroCompress introduces neural lossless compression for astrophysics data, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing observatory data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote observatories face data transmission bottlenecks; improved compression can unlock additional scientific value from costly instruments.

Method: AstroCompress benchmarks seven lossless compression methods (three neural, four classical) on diverse astrophysics datasets.

Result: Neural compression techniques show promise for improving data collection efficiency at observatories.

Conclusion: Neural compression can enhance scientific data handling, with potential for future exploration of lossy methods.

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.

(iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully
autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via
successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is
identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for
incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The
feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a
pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate
our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the
Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each
natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically
equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of
tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30%
of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs,
LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

*Amur Ghose,Andrew B. Kahng,Sayak Kundu,Zhiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent, improves parameter tuning in hardware design flows, outperforming Bayesian optimization with 13% better wirelength and clock period, and 40% fewer iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for automating and optimizing high-dimensional parameter tuning in integrated circuit design, addressing challenges in performance, power, and area.

Method: Introduces ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that adaptively explores parameter configurations in hardware design flows.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ORFS-agent improves routed wirelength and clock period by over 13% and uses 40% fewer iterations than Bayesian optimization.

Conclusion: ORFS-agent provides a flexible, interpretable, and modular framework for multi-objective optimization in hardware design, compatible with any frontier LLM.

Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering
workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design,
modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical
layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small
changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired
outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning
within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce
ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter
tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores
parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard
Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final
design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and
a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed
wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer
optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to
trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and
interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent
is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM
without any further fine-tuning.

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Pengyu Zeng,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FloorplanMAE is a self-supervised learning framework that predicts complete floorplans from partial ones, improving design efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floorplan design is iterative; predicting complete plans from partial ones can save time and reduce workload.

Method: Uses Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) to reconstruct missing parts of floorplans, trained on FloorplanNet dataset.

Result: Generates high-quality complete floorplans from incomplete ones, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: FloorplanMAE offers a scalable solution for floorplan generation with broad applications.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and
iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan
according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining
throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete
floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process.
Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs,
improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated
modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised
learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones.
First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet,
specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor
plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which
reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a
lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy
of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally,
we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of
architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can
generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This
framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad
application prospects.

*Leheng Sheng,An Zhang,Zijian Wu,Weixiang Zhao,Changshuo Shen,Yi Zhang,Xiang Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) pre-plan reasoning strength via activations, controlled by a directional vector's magnitude, enabling performance modulation and practical applications like overthinking detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underlying mechanism of LRMs' automatic reasoning strength allocation, which improves task performance but remains poorly understood.

Method: Analyze model activations, use linear probes to predict reasoning tokens, and manipulate a pre-allocated directional vector to modulate reasoning strength.

Result: LRMs encode reasoning strength in activations via a directional vector; modifying this vector affects reasoning token count and performance.

Conclusion: The study reveals LRMs' internal reasoning mechanisms and offers tools for controlling reasoning behaviors, with applications in efficiency and detection.

Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can
automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning
tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task
performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has
been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To
this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of
model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths
in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength
causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.
Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely
based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs
estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs
encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector
embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude
modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced
reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to
increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further
reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length
prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to
affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications
of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient
reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal
mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling
their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from VLMs in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios is challenging.

Method: SafeCoT leverages rule-based chain-of-thought supervision to help models reason about safety risks and make context-aware refusals.

Result: Experiments show SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances generalization, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: SafeCoT offers a scalable solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

### [110] [Single-Node Trigger Backdoor Attacks in Graph-Based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08401)
*Runze Li,Di Jin,Xiaobao Wang,Dongxiao He,Bingdao Feng,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel graph backdoor attack method is proposed to covertly expose target items to users without disrupting the recommendation system's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shilling attacks are not stealthy and highly destructive, prompting the need for a more covert and controlled attack method.

Method: A single-node trigger generator is designed to expose target items by inserting one fake user node, with constraints to minimize impact on unrelated nodes.

Result: The method achieves ≥50% exposure for 99% of target users while limiting system performance impact to ~5%.

Conclusion: The proposed backdoor attack effectively balances exposure and stealth, offering a refined approach to manipulating recommendation systems.

Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to
effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However,
these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The
prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results
by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack
strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack
method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in
a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we
design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple
target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node.
Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and
irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation
system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target
items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on
the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework combining LLMs with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization automates taxonomy alignment, achieving high accuracy (F1-score 0.97) and outperforming human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual taxonomy alignment is costly and subjective, while automated methods struggle with nuanced semantics and transparency.

Method: Integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human validation to guide LLMs in generating taxonomy linkages and rationales.

Result: Achieved an F1-score of 0.97, surpassing the human benchmark of 0.68 in a domain-specific mapping task.

Conclusion: The framework effectively scales taxonomy alignment, ensuring high-quality mappings and expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge
representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to
be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy
alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective
interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods
for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling
nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different
domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept
mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework
that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and
iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method
integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human
validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting
rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of
concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding
the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings
and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

*Yong Liang Goh,Zhiguang Cao,Yining Ma,Jianan Zhou,Mohammad Haroon Dupty,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHIELD introduces a novel model for the Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, leveraging sparsity and hierarchy principles for improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for routing problems overlook complex real-world customer distributions, prompting the need for a more realistic and adaptable solution.

Method: SHIELD uses a deeper decoder with Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) for sparsity and a context-based clustering layer for hierarchical structures.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Conclusion: SHIELD's adaptive computation and hierarchical learning significantly improve generalization for unseen tasks and distributions.

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown
great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they
overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we
advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet
challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce
SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles.
Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both
efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes
to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively
allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared
representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits
the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local
representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key
features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to
significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9
real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing fundamental challenges and proposing future research directions.

Method: Review of methods including pretraining, fine-tuning (supervised and reinforcement learning), and techniques like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and test-time scaling.

Result: Notable progress in LLMs' mathematical reasoning, but challenges remain in capacity, efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: Promising directions include advanced pretraining, formal reasoning frameworks, and meta-generalization to further improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and
challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years,
large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area.
This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in
LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain
mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer
generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical
reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such
as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work
on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental
challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To
address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including
advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning
frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This
survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques
to other domains.

TL;DR: CIPHER is a hybrid AI framework for industrial control, combining vision-language-action capabilities with expert knowledge and quantitative precision, enabling autonomous, transparent decision-making in unpredictable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial processes need adaptable, robust control systems, but current AI solutions lack generalization and precision. CIPHER aims to bridge this gap by integrating human-like reasoning and expert knowledge.

Method: CIPHER uses a hybrid architecture with a process expert, regression model, and retrieval-augmented generation for physics-informed reasoning. It processes visual/textual inputs and generates precise machine instructions without explicit annotations.

Result: CIPHER demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, interprets inputs, explains decisions, and autonomously generates precise instructions.

Conclusion: CIPHER provides a foundation for autonomous industrial systems with precision, contextual reasoning, and transparent communication, enabling safe and trusted deployment.

Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks
are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult
to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend
on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their
ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings.
Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but
rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications.
Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise
and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming
to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a
commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model
enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for
engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to
access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought
reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to
out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process
monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine
instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the
foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with
context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted
deployment in industrial settings.

TL;DR: RHealthTwin is a framework for responsible AI-powered digital twins in healthcare, addressing hallucination, bias, and ethical concerns through structured prompts and feedback loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks like hallucination and bias in LLM-based healthcare applications, aligning with WHO recommendations for ethical AI use.

Method: Uses a Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE) to dynamically structure inputs, ensuring context-aware, fair, and explainable responses, with adaptive feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (BLEU=0.41, ROUGE-L=0.63, BERTScore=0.89) and over 90% ethical compliance in evaluations.

Conclusion: RHealthTwin provides a responsible foundation for LLM-based healthcare applications, ensuring safety and reliability.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for
digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in
consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,
bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations
from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose
Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and
governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin
processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,
relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the
Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional
LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the
system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of
hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to
structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses
that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for
well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a
feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We
evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental
support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE
achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and
BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical
compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,
outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking
foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

TL;DR: FedTAIL is a federated domain generalization framework addressing class imbalance and conflicting objectives via sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DG methods struggle with long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives, limiting generalization.

Method: FedTAIL uses gradient coherence regularization, class-wise sharpness minimization, and curvature-aware dynamic weighting to harmonize optimization and align distributions.

Result: FedTAIL outperforms benchmarks, especially under domain shifts and label imbalance, in both centralized and federated settings.

Conclusion: FedTAIL effectively unifies optimization, regularization, and alignment, proving robust in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

TL;DR: A novel UAV trajectory planning framework combines DRL with LLM reasoning to address urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy and UAV adoption highlights challenges in trajectory planning, such as urban constraints and efficiency, which current studies often overlook.

Method: The proposed framework integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with large language model (LLM) reasoning for optimized UAV path planning.

Result: The method excels in data collection, collision avoidance, landing success, compliance, and energy efficiency, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses UAV trajectory planning challenges in low-altitude economy contexts, validating its practical viability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread
adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents
new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments.
However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace
constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude
economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising
solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low
learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV
trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM)
reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate,
collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy
efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in
addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the
low-altitude economy networking.

TL;DR: HGformer, a hierarchical graph Transformer framework, improves resource allocation in two-stage Colonel Blotto games by combining graph Transformer encoders and reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sequential dependency and graph topology constraints in two-stage Colonel Blotto games challenge traditional methods, necessitating a novel approach for globally optimal strategies.

Method: HGformer uses a graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, enhanced by a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: HGformer significantly boosts resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, outperforming existing hierarchical and graph neural network methods.

Conclusion: HGformer effectively addresses the challenges of two-stage Colonel Blotto games, offering superior performance in dynamic adversarial environments.

Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource
allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate
resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource
deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The
sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed
by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a
globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a
hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an
enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent
hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation
in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer
feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from
lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy,
thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical
decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly
improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving
superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

*Douwe Geurtjens,Xixi Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoldA, a technique for computing partial-order alignments using directed Petri net unfoldings to address state space explosion and better represent concurrency in process mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods in conformance checking suffer from state space explosion and fail to accurately represent concurrent behavior in real-world processes.

Method: The proposed technique, FoldA, computes partial-order alignments on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings.

Result: Evaluation on synthetic and real-life datasets shows FoldA reduces queued states and better represents concurrency, though it requires more computation time.

Conclusion: FoldA offers a more accurate and efficient solution for conformance checking in processes with high concurrency, despite increased computational demands.

Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which
quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a
normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by
exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process
model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly
when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as
alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully
represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing
partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named
FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare
it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6
benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it
requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states
and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

TL;DR: A modular recurrent architecture improves generalization for multi-robot control by inferring partially observable contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving universal control for any robot morphology to enhance computational and data efficiency.

Method: Implemented a modular recurrent architecture to infer contextual information through interactions, evaluated on MuJoCo robots.

Result: Substantial performance improvement on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies across four environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively generalizes to new robot contexts, advancing multi-robot control.

Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve
computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about
the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in
the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made
towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however,
remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual
information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through
interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during
training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and
evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The
results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics,
kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

TL;DR: A self-rewarding RL framework (CoVo) enhances LLM reasoning by leveraging consistency in intermediate reasoning states, eliminating the need for external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of RL's reliance on external supervision for training in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces CoVo, an intrinsic reward mechanism combining Consistency and Volatility metrics with a curiosity bonus for exploration.

Result: CoVo achieves performance comparable to or better than supervised RL on diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoVo provides a scalable, unsupervised method for improving LLM reasoning through self-rewarding RL.

Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential
in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external
supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a
novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language
Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning
states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct
responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model
likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their
own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other
candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo,
an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a
robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to
promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a
self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason
without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning
benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing
supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

*Boyang Sun,Yu Yao,Xinshuai Dong,Zongfang Liu,Tongliang Liu,Yumou Qiu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sample-efficient CI test for latent continuous variables without binarizing discretized data, using GMM and nodewise regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct CI tests on discretized data yield incorrect results, and binarization causes information loss, degrading test performance.

Method: The method leverages GMM to address over-identifying restrictions and uses nodewise regression to derive a test statistic.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show the test's superiority and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed test avoids binarization, preserving information and improving CI test accuracy.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as
discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional
Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to
incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to
infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through
binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of
information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this
paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the
binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent
continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying
restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this
insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic
distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression.
Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate
that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test. Our code
implementation is provided in https://github.com/boyangaaaaa/DCT

### [123] [Paths to Causality: Finding Informative Subgraphs Within Knowledge Graphs for Knowledge-Based Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08771)
*Yuni Susanti,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve knowledge-based causal discovery, outperforming baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for causal discovery are unstable and inconsistent, necessitating a more reliable approach.

Method: The approach uses KGs to identify metapath-based subgraphs, refines them with Learning-to-Rank models, and incorporates them into zero-shot prompts for LLMs.

Result: The method achieves superior performance, with up to 44.4 points improvement in F1 scores across diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: Integrating KGs with LLMs enhances causal discovery reliability and effectiveness, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

*Irene Testini,José Hernández-Orallo,Lorenzo Pacchiardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper surveys LLM assistants and agents in data science, highlighting gaps in evaluation, such as limited focus on data management, lack of intermediate human-AI collaboration, and overemphasis on human substitution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the current state and gaps in evaluating LLM assistants and agents for data science tasks.

Method: Survey of existing evaluations of LLM assistants and agents in data science.

Result: Identified three key gaps: narrow focus on goal-oriented tasks, lack of intermediate collaboration levels, and neglect of task transformation potential.

Conclusion: Calls for broader evaluation frameworks to address overlooked aspects of LLM use in data science.

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making
processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as
assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code
snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation
of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents,
i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such
as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions
and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation
of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on
a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management
and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully
autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI
collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting
the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

TL;DR: The study examines the neural and behavioral effects of using LLMs for essay writing, revealing cognitive costs like weaker brain connectivity and reduced ownership, compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive and behavioral impacts of LLM-assisted writing versus traditional methods (search engines or no tools).

Method: Participants were divided into groups (LLM, Search Engine, Brain-only) and assessed using EEG, NLP, and human/AI scoring. Session 4 involved reassigning groups.

Result: LLM users showed weaker brain connectivity, lower essay ownership, and underperformance. Brain-only users had stronger neural engagement and higher ownership.

Conclusion: LLM reliance may have long-term cognitive and educational costs, warranting further research into AI's role in learning.

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted
essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,
and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same
condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group
(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition
(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18
completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive
load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring
essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,
n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG
revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants
exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed
moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.
Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,
LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,
indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall
and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search
Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group
and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately
quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings
highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently
underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results
raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and
underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

*Mingfeng Fan,Jianan Zhou,Yifeng Zhang,Yaoxin Wu,Jinbiao Chen,Guillaume Adrien Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POCCO is a plug-and-play framework for multi-objective combinatorial optimization, using adaptive model selection and preference-driven optimization to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all subproblems equally with a single model, limiting solution space exploration and performance.

Method: POCCO uses conditional computation blocks to route subproblems to specialized architectures and a preference-driven optimization algorithm.

Result: POCCO shows significant superiority and strong generalization across four MOCOP benchmarks.

Conclusion: POCCO effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success
in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by
decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific
weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally
and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the
solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the
limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables
adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently
optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values.
Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems
to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven
optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and
losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying
it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results
across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority
and strong generalization.

*Yash Ranjan,Rahul Sengupta,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study proposes data-driven traffic simulators using deep generative models to mimic real-world driving behavior at intersections, introducing new evaluation metrics and a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rule-based traffic simulators fail to accurately mimic real-world driving behavior, especially at intersections, which are critical for safety and efficiency.

Method: The study uses deep generative modeling for trajectory prediction, introduces traffic engineering metrics, and develops a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline. A multi-headed self-attention-based model incorporating signal information is also proposed.

Result: The proposed model outperforms previous models on the new evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Data-driven simulators with deep generative models and tailored metrics can better mimic intersection dynamics, improving traffic simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

*Yash Ranjan,Rahul Sengupta,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tool to evaluate deep generative models for traffic intersection dynamics using traffic-specific metrics, revealing rule-breaking behaviors despite low trajectory errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for traffic intersection dynamics focus on trajectory reconstruction errors but lack evaluation in live simulations and ignore traffic engineering concerns like red-light violations.

Method: The authors train a multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on real-world intersection data and evaluate it online in a microsimulator under unseen conditions.

Result: Despite low trajectory errors, the model generates behaviors violating traffic rules, highlighting the need for better evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: New metrics are introduced to assess undesired behaviors, providing deeper insights into model performance from a traffic engineering perspective.

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the
movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting
trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic
dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities
better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are
evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory
reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live'
microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider
traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed
stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to
train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into
model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a
state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset
collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection.
We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a
microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using
ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory
reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break
traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors
and present our results.

TL;DR: A survey on link prediction in N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs), covering methods, performance, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NKGs represent complex facts with more than two entities, and link prediction is crucial for completing NKGs and enhancing downstream applications.

Method: Systematic categorization and analysis of existing link prediction methods in NKGs.

Result: Overview of the field, performance evaluation of methods, and identification of application scenarios.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of link prediction in NKGs and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph
designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional
knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can
capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs
aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential
for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications.
This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present
the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an
overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and
analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline
promising directions for future research.

*Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AbstentionBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to abstain from answering uncertain or unanswerable queries, revealing it as an unsolved problem even for advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLMs can reliably abstain from answering uncertain or flawed queries, a systematic evaluation framework is needed.

Method: AbstentionBench evaluates 20 LLMs across diverse datasets with unanswerable, underspecified, or subjective questions.

Result: Scaling models doesn't improve abstention; reasoning fine-tuning worsens it by 24%. System prompts help but don't resolve core uncertainty reasoning issues.

Conclusion: Abstention remains a challenge, requiring further research to enhance LLM reliability.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and
high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as
answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified,
ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about
uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively.
However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation
framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a
large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse
datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false
premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20
frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling
models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive
results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning
fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and
science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that
while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it
does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We
release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

TL;DR: VIKI-Bench is a hierarchical benchmark for embodied multi-agent cooperation, and VIKI-R is a two-stage framework that outperforms baselines by combining VLM fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments, particularly the lack of support for diverse embodiment types in existing VLM-based approaches.

Method: Introduces VIKI-Bench with three levels (agent activation, task planning, trajectory perception) and VIKI-R, a framework combining VLM fine-tuning (using Chain-of-Thought demonstrations) and reinforcement learning.

Result: VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines across all task levels and enables compositional cooperation among heterogeneous agents.

Conclusion: VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R provide a unified testbed and method for advancing visual-driven multi-agent cooperation in embodied AI.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core
challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven
reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have
begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However,
these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse
embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical
benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three
structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception.
VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations,
and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual
inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a
two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM)
using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement
learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that
VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels.
Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of
compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together,
VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing
multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI performance in algorithm engineering for complex optimization tasks like routing, scheduling, and planning, where exact solutions are unknown.

Method: ALE-Bench uses real tasks from AtCoder Heuristic Contests, supports iterative refinement, and includes interactive agent architectures with feedback and visualizations.

Result: Frontier LLMs show high performance on specific problems but lag behind humans in consistency and long-term problem-solving.

Conclusion: ALE-Bench is essential to drive future AI advancements in solving hard optimization problems.

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization
problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory
production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new
benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming
contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench
presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known
exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench
encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software
framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run
feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that
while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap
remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and
long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this
benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

### [133] [Conservative Bias in Large Language Models: Measuring Relation Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08120)
*Toyin Aguda,Erik Wilson,Allan Anzagira,Simerjot Kaur,Charese Smiley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show conservative bias in relation extraction, often choosing 'No_Relation' to avoid errors, but this leads to information loss. The study evaluates this trade-off, introducing 'Hobson's choice' to describe safe but uninformative labels. Conservative bias is twice as common as hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the conservative bias in LLMs during relation extraction tasks, which causes information loss despite preventing incorrect assignments.

Method: Systematic evaluation across prompts, datasets, and relation types, using SBERT and LLM prompts to measure semantic similarity between conservative bias behaviors.

Result: Conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination, and the study quantifies its impact using semantic similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The conservative bias in LLMs, while preventing errors, significantly reduces informative output, highlighting a trade-off between safety and usefulness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation
extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an
appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect
relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant
information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We
systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and
relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios
where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our
findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination.
To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic
similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and
labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QA-LIGN decomposes rewards by principles for transparent AI alignment, matching or outperforming DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reward-based alignment methods obscure feedback by collapsing it into a single scalar, limiting interpretability.

Method: QA-LIGN uses principle-specific evaluation questions to derive separate reward components, preserving structure.

Result: QA-LIGN enhances transparency and adaptability while performing on par with or better than DPO.

Conclusion: QA-LIGN advances interpretable and controllable alignment without compromising performance.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as
helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and
reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically
collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple
objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In
this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition
approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within
the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs
a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions
and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in
reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language
model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers
greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same
time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO
baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and
controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing
end-task performance.

Motivation: To address the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning and fidelity to authoritative data sources, unlike prior work.

Method: Tasks are generated by prompting LLMs, followed by human curation for clarity and feasibility. The benchmark evaluates multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyzing failure cases and conducting ablation studies.

Result: Substantial performance gaps are revealed, highlighting challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: EconWebArena serves as a rigorous testbed for advancing economic web intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on
complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark
comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains
such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task
challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual
content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive
data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting
multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by
rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.
Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data
sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a
diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure
cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,

*Muhammad Usman,Muhammad Ahmad,M. Shahiki Tash,Irina Gelbukh,Rolando Quintero Tellez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trilingual dataset for hate speech detection in English, Urdu, and Spanish, using attention layers and transformer models to improve performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech on social media is a growing concern, but Urdu remains underexplored. The study aims to fill this gap and enhance multilingual detection.

Method: A trilingual dataset was created and benchmarked using transformer models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, Qwen 2.5 72B) and traditional ML (SVM, BERT). Attention layers were integrated for feature extraction.

Result: The approach achieved high macro F1 scores (0.87 for English, 0.85 for Spanish, 0.81 for Urdu, 0.88 for multilingual), outperforming SVM baselines by 5-9%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for multilingual hate speech detection, improving online safety.

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

*Lijing Zhu,Qizhen Lan,Qing Tian,Wenbo Sun,Li Yang,Lu Xia,Yixin Xie,Xi Xiao,Tiehang Duan,Cui Tao,Shuteng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT-CKGE introduces task-driven tokens for efficient continual knowledge graph embedding, improving scalability and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CKGE methods struggle with efficiency and scalability due to suboptimal knowledge preservation and high computational costs.

Method: ETT-CKGE uses learnable task-driven tokens to capture task-relevant signals, eliminating explicit node scoring or traversal, and enables efficient token-masked embedding alignment.

Result: ETT-CKGE achieves superior or competitive performance on six benchmark datasets while significantly reducing training time and memory usage.

Conclusion: ETT-CKGE is a scalable and efficient solution for continual knowledge graph embedding, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge
while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with
efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge
preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation
importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream
task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation
importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To
address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven,
Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE
method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective
knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable
tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for
explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and
reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding
alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved
through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and
memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive
performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability
compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces GrAImes, a literary theory-based protocol for evaluating AI-generated microfiction, focusing on thematic coherence, clarity, depth, and aesthetics, validated by experts and enthusiasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI advancements in generating coherent fiction, assessing literary merit, especially aesthetics, lacks attention. This paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: Proposes GrAImes, an evaluation protocol grounded in literary theory, validated by literature experts and enthusiasts.

Result: GrAImes provides an objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction, validated by both experts and enthusiasts.

Conclusion: GrAImes serves as a foundational tool for evaluating the literary value of AI-generated microfictions.

Abstract: Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large
language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent
short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such
outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has
received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating
AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of
literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic
coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To
facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in
literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an
objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we
report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by
both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a
foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing
their literary value.

*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-BT is a back-translation framework using LLMs to automate and standardize technical terms across languages, achieving high consistency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-driven standardization struggles with rapid growth of technical terms, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and quantum computing. Manual methods lack multilingual consistency.

Method: LLM-BT employs term-level consistency validation, a multi-path verification workflow, and conceptualizes back-translation as dynamic semantic embedding.

Result: Achieves over 90% exact/semantic matches, strong cross-lingual robustness (BLEU > 0.45, 100% accuracy in Portuguese), and transparent path-based embeddings.

Conclusion: LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for multilingual standardization, enabling human-AI collaboration for semantic fidelity and cultural interpretation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional
expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and
quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency.
We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization
via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1)
Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate
language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term
consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies
showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path
Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize''
pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw
$\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese
$\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong
cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%).
\textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as
dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike
static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by
model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for
multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration:
machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This
infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and
technological fields worldwide.

*Chupei Wang,Jiaqiu Vince Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with intra-context interference, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates, revealing a working memory bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intra-context interference affects LLM retrieval, inspired by cognitive science's proactive interference (PI) paradigm.

Method: Introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation streaming related key-value updates and querying final values, measuring retrieval accuracy.

Result: LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly with interference; prompt engineering mitigates poorly.

Conclusion: LLMs face a working memory bottleneck, needing better methods to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly
recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup.
While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of
intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the
proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier
information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such
interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce
PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value
updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are
clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines
log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from
retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via
prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield
limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs'
ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information,
suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls
for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content
during retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using writing process data (keystroke logs and snapshots) improves LLM feedback for student essays, making it more relatable and useful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM feedback lacks context on how essays are written. This study explores if incorporating writing process data can enhance feedback quality.

Method: A digital writing tool captured student writing processes. LLM feedback was generated using final essays and writing traces, then evaluated via student surveys.

Result: Students preferred process-aware feedback, finding it more aligned with their thinking. Certain edits (e.g., adding content) correlated with higher scores.

Conclusion: Incorporating writing process data into LLMs can make feedback more meaningful, personal, and supportive for learners.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for
supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the
final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this
paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through
keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that
better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital
writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve
over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were
then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final
essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed
surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results
show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in
tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like
adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher
scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that
making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels
more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

Motivation: The increasing complexity of compound AI systems necessitates new optimization methods beyond traditional approaches like SFT and RL.

Method: Systematic review and formalization of compound AI system optimization, classifying methods and identifying challenges.

Result: Highlights advancements and gaps in optimizing interactions between AI components, with a focus on non-differentiable systems.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for continued research to address challenges in optimizing complex AI workflows.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led
to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By
integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly
adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in
complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components
but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain
foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new
approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper
provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI
systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We
formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing
methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges
and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers

TL;DR: CLAIM-BENCH evaluates LLMs' ability to extract and validate scientific claims and evidence, revealing limitations and performance gaps between closed-source and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation, particularly in linking claims and evidence, which remains underexplored.

Method: Developed CLAIM-BENCH, a benchmark comparing three divide-and-conquer approaches across six LLMs, tested on 300+ claim-evidence pairs.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4, Claude) outperform open-source ones in precision and recall. Three-pass and one-by-one prompting improves accuracy but increases computational cost.

Conclusion: CLAIM-BENCH provides a diagnostic tool for LLMs' scientific comprehension, highlighting the need for improved reasoning in full-length papers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research
tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper
analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate
relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between
claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task
that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We
systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and
conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific
strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation
involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we
reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific
content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and
Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall
across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed
three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs'
abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this
comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for
evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool
and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable
reasoning across full-length papers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy of inference types for reading comprehension (RC) and uses GPT-4o to generate diagnostic RC questions, achieving high quality but lower accuracy in matching targeted inference types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reading instruction by providing targeted diagnostic RC questions and exploring automated generation methods.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of inference types, analyzed an RC item bank, and experimented with GPT-4o for generating bridging-inference RC items using few-shot prompting.

Result: GPT-4o produced 93.8% good-quality questions, but only 42.6% matched the targeted inference type. High inter-rater agreement (>0.90) was achieved.

Conclusion: Combining automatic item generation with human judgment is promising for scalable, high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension
(RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some
rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly
written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more
effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age
students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to
analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we
present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for
given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and
without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three
aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning,
achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o
produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade
3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately
matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item
generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable,
high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a high-quality dataset of public domain books from Harvard Library, addressing the scarcity of training data for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of LLMs highlights the need for sustainable, high-quality datasets with clear provenance.

Method: Extracted, analyzed, and processed Harvard Library's digitized public domain books, totaling 983,004 volumes (242B tokens).

Result: Released a well-documented dataset of historic texts, including OCR-extracted text and metadata.

Conclusion: The project aims to improve accessibility and usability of historical collections for both humans and machines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to
produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale,
quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to
support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality.
The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into
focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and
revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in
sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical
report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain
books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the
Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we
extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented
dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard
Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning
1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of
approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the
OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata
(bibliographic, source, and generated) of the 983,004 volumes, or 242B tokens,
identified as being in the public domain have been made available. This report
describes this project's goals and methods as well as the results of the
analyses we performed, all in service of making this historical collection more
accessible and easier for humans and machines alike to filter, read and use.

Motivation: Large reasoning models often produce redundant outputs due to overthinking, hindering efficiency. This study explores if explicit self-reflection is necessary for advanced reasoning.

Method: Proposes NoWait, which disables self-reflection tokens during inference. Evaluated on ten benchmarks across textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks.

Result: NoWait reduces reasoning trajectory length by 27%-51% in R1-style models without compromising utility.

Conclusion: NoWait is a plug-and-play solution for efficient, utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step
reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose
and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether
explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is
necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective
approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens
during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual,
visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought
trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without
compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for
efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: To explore underexplored capabilities of LLMs across different cognitive levels in the medical domain.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating medical datasets and tasks targeting three cognitive levels, evaluating six LLM families.

Result: Performance declines with higher cognitive complexity; model size is more critical at higher levels.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to enhance LLMs' higher cognitive capabilities for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive
levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a
multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical
domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and
introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,
comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using
this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical
LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.
Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity
increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role
in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to
enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides
insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper advocates for shifting text embedding research focus from surface-level to implicit semantics, highlighting current limitations and proposing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text embedding models focus on surface-level semantics, neglecting implicit meaning shaped by pragmatics, intent, and context, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The paper critiques current models, presents a pilot study showing their shortcomings, and proposes a paradigm shift in research priorities.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on implicit semantics tasks, barely outperforming simple baselines.

Conclusion: The paper calls for prioritizing diverse training data, better benchmarks, and framing implicit meaning as a core objective to align embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the text embedding research community should
move beyond surface meaning and embrace implicit semantics as a central
modeling goal. Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,
powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research
attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level
semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often
implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.
Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth
and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a
result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker
stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that
even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic
baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm
shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically
grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic
understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling
objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A causal-attribution framework identifies behavior-relevant attention heads in LLMs using VQ-AE and binary classification, improving inference-time steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current module selection methods for LLMs rely on superficial cues, leading to suboptimal outcomes. A principled approach is needed.

Method: Train VQ-AE on attention activations, partition latent space, and assess relevance via binary classification of behavior-aligned vs. violating responses.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in truthfulness-steering tasks and shows zero-shot generalization in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework provides accurate, generalizable module selection for behavior steering in LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large
language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A
critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within
LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches
to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics,
which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose
a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant
attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized
autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space
into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a
shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by
quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus
behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields
a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity
with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance
weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five
behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate
inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the
truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach
exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering
scenarios.

TL;DR: CC-RAG improves LLMs' causal reasoning by integrating structured causal chains into RAG, outperforming standard methods in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' limitations in causal reasoning, especially in specialized domains where flat context retrieval is insufficient.

Method: Introduces CC-RAG, combining zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining to build a DAG for structured multi-hop inference.

Result: CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity, validated by human and LLM evaluations.

Conclusion: Modeling causal structure explicitly enhances LLMs' accuracy and interpretability, proving effective where flat retrieval fails.

Abstract: Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where
reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat
evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal
dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that
integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the
RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific
corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation,
effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer
generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations
and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot
LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both
LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate
more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains
where flat retrieval fails.

*Zikai Xiao,Ziyang Wang,Wen Ma,Yan Zhang,Wei Shen,Yan Wang,Luqi Gong,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance degradation in LLMs for long contexts, proposing a training-free method (PCD) to mitigate it by leveraging positional contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs degrade in performance for long contexts, and existing solutions are costly. The study explores statistical behaviors and cost-effective approaches.

Method: Introduces Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD), contrasting logits from long-aware and local-aware attention to focus on gains from short-to-long training.

Result: PCD alleviates attention score degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

Conclusion: PCD is an effective, training-free solution for improving LLM performance in long-context scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with
performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur
prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective
approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the
Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio
correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the
attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding
space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive
Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with
those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the
gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of
long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates
attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves

*Kevin Galim,Ethan Ewer,Wonjun Kang,Minjae Lee,Hyung Il Koo,Kangwook Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework using small draft models to optimize LLM inference by predicting token and KV pair importance, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers in long-context LLMs necessitate efficient inference methods. Existing approximations rely on rough predictions, lacking accuracy.

Method: Proposes SpecKV (for KV cache dropping) and SpecPC (for prompt compression), leveraging draft models to predict importance more accurately.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than baselines while maintaining improvements in memory, latency, and throughput.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of draft models in approximate LLM inference, extending their utility beyond speculative decoding.

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory
complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value
(KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely
on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel
framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to
more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we
introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which
leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair
for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft
model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt
tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft
models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility
beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with
theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the
attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on
long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher
accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in
memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at

*Tao Zou,Xinghua Zhang,Haiyang Yu,Minzheng Wang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EIFBENCH is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in multi-task, constrained scenarios, revealing performance gaps and proposing SegPO for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack complexity for real-world LLM applications, necessitating a more robust evaluation tool.

Method: Developed EIFBENCH for multi-task, constrained scenarios and proposed SegPO to enhance LLM performance.

Result: Evaluations showed significant performance gaps in LLMs under complex instructions.

Conclusion: Ongoing optimization is needed to address the challenges of complex LLM applications.

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of large language models
(LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands
higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise
workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks.
However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited
constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following
Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and
robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that
enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but
also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational
environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO)
algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task
workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance
discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex
instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization
to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSTEB, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on low-resource languages, revealing performance gaps compared to high-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for low-resource languages in LLMs.

Method: Introduces mSTEB, a benchmark covering tasks like language identification, text classification, QA, and translation across speech and text. Evaluates models like Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o (Audio), Qwen 2 Audio, and Gemma 3 27B.

Result: Shows significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially in African and Americas/Oceania languages.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more investment to improve LLM coverage for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

TL;DR: TACTIC is a cognitively informed multi-agent framework for machine translation, leveraging LLMs and human cognitive strategies to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent translation frameworks lack insights from cognitive translation studies, which could enhance translation quality by mimicking human strategies.

Method: Proposes TACTIC, a framework with six specialized agents (drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, knowledge gathering) to simulate human cognitive processes.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1 on FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks, with significant improvements in XCOMET and COMETKIWI-23 scores.

Conclusion: TACTIC effectively integrates cognitive insights with LLMs, demonstrating superior translation quality and setting a new benchmark for multi-agent translation systems.

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language
processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there
has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing
the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies
have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into
collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation
quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing
multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from
cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators
employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free
translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating
outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed
multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with
Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six
functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in
human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,
evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By
simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC
effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.
Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24
benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by
an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it
further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at

*Ziyang Ma,Qingyue Yuan,Zhenglin Wang,Deyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMeco and MIRA to evaluate and improve LLM meta-cognition, showing effectiveness on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack step-level analysis of LLM meta-cognition, crucial for reliability.

Method: Proposes AutoMeco for benchmarking meta-cognition lenses and MIRA for improving them.

Result: AutoMeco is validated against Best-of-N; MIRA enhances meta-cognition evaluation.

Conclusion: AutoMeco and MIRA advance LLM meta-cognition assessment and improvement.

Abstract: Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze
mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the
meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors),
which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation
present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer
correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level
analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM
meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses.
Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation
framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free
Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost
current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical
reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by
comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability
of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Know-MRI, an open-source tool to systematically analyze knowledge mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) by integrating diverse interpretation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretation methods for LLMs vary in input formats and outputs, limiting their practical use. Know-MRI aims to unify these methods for broader applicability.

Method: Developed an extensible core module that auto-matches input data with interpretation methods and consolidates outputs, enabling flexible analysis of LLM knowledge mechanisms.

Result: Know-MRI allows users to choose interpretation methods freely, facilitating comprehensive diagnosis of LLM knowledge from multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: Know-MRI addresses limitations of current tools by providing a unified, extensible framework for interpreting LLM knowledge mechanisms.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing
urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms.
Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the
knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current
interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs.
The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with
specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To
address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms
Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms
within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core
module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation
methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely
choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier
to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from
multiple perspectives. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAF-I is a multi-agent LLM framework for sarcasm detection, addressing single-perspective limitations, lack of understanding, and interpretability. It outperforms baselines with a 4.98% Macro-F1 improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with irony detection due to limited perspectives, insufficient understanding, and poor interpretability.

Method: CAF-I uses specialized agents (Context, Semantics, Rhetoric) for multidimensional analysis, collaborative optimization, and a Decision Agent with Refinement Evaluator for feedback.

Result: CAF-I achieves SOTA zero-shot performance (76.31 Macro-F1), a 4.98% improvement over prior baselines.

Conclusion: CAF-I's human-like multi-perspective analysis enhances accuracy and interpretability in sarcasm detection.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of
sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony
detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient
comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper
introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven
multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized
agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional
analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent
then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent
providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark
datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving
SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of
76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This
success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective
analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how numerical precisions and data parallelization affect LLM training efficiency and accuracy, aiming to make domain adaptation more accessible in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and cultural biases in LLM training hinder accessibility, especially for groups without large-scale infrastructure.

Method: Evaluates the impact of numerical precisions and data parallelization on training speed and model accuracy.

Result: Findings suggest strategies to balance efficiency and accuracy, aiding low-resource domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for energy-efficient and accessible LLM training, addressing hardware and cultural challenges.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

### [160] [Olica: Efficient Structured Pruning of Large Language Models without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08436)
*Jiujun He,Huazhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Olica is a pruning framework for LLMs that avoids retraining by using PCA and SVD to compress models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods for LLMs require costly retraining, which Olica aims to eliminate.

Method: Olica uses PCA on MHA layers and SVD-based linear calibration for FFN layers to prune without retraining.

Result: Olica reduces computational costs and maintains accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Olica offers an efficient, retraining-free pruning solution for LLMs.

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: U-CoT+ is a framework for harmful meme detection using a meme-to-text pipeline and zero-shot CoT prompting for resource efficiency, flexibility, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for harmful meme detection lack resource efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Develops a meme-to-text pipeline for textual descriptions, then uses zero-shot CoT prompting with human-crafted guidelines for classification.

Result: Validated on seven datasets, showing effectiveness for explainable and low-resource detection with small-scale LLMs.

Conclusion: U-CoT+ offers a flexible, explainable, and efficient solution for harmful meme detection, adaptable across platforms and regions.

Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online
environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource
efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment
in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely
on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity
meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual
descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme
classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual
content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general
large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we
further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide
models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows
for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across
platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and
explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and
low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are

*Chihiro Taguchi,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval dynamically selects context size for QA, outperforming fixed methods with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimal context retrieval in QA, where fixed sizes waste tokens or miss evidence, and existing adaptive methods struggle with aggregation QA.

Method: Adaptive-$k$ retrieval selects passages based on similarity scores, requiring no fine-tuning or extra LLM inferences.

Result: Matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines, uses 10x fewer tokens, and retrieves 70% of relevant passages. Improves accuracy across models.

Conclusion: Dynamic context adjustment enhances QA efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs)
both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering
(QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem:
fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence.
Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM
prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA,
where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present
Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that
adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the
similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not
require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing
retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks,
Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x
fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant
passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models,
highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient
and accurate QA.

TL;DR: The paper critiques current text-to-image evaluation frameworks for lacking reliability and proposes improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations focus on human agreement but miss other critical properties for trustworthy assessment.

Method: Identifies key aspects of reliable evaluation and tests current frameworks against them.

Result: Current frameworks fail to fully meet these properties across metrics and models.

Conclusion: Recommends improvements for better image-text alignment evaluation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match
textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of
image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations
primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical
properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first
identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then
empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to
fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models.
Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment
evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper conducts a large-scale audit of instruction-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) to assess ethical risks, revealing insights on fairness, bias, and trade-offs in resource-constrained deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of SLMs for on-device and resource-constrained deployments has outpaced understanding of their ethical risks, necessitating a comprehensive audit.

Method: The study evaluates nine open-source SLMs (0.5 to 5B parameters) using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, analyzing utility and fairness in ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.

Result: Key findings include: 1) Phi models achieve high F1 scores (90%+) with minimal bias; 2) Qwen 2.5 models show vacuous neutrality, while LLaMA 3.2 exhibits stereotypical bias; 3) 4-bit AWQ quantization improves F1 but increases bias in some cases.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for responsible SLM deployment, emphasizing fairness and efficiency for small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and
resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their
ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale
audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an
overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our
evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma
3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we
analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.
This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need
not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while
exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable.
Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may
appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or
evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2
models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather
than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ
quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but
increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points.
These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of
SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting
small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources for evaluating LLMs' understanding and bias regarding region-specific etiquettes.

Method: Introduces EtiCor++, a global corpus of etiquettes, and tasks/metrics to evaluate LLMs.

Result: Experiments reveal inherent biases in LLMs towards certain regions.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for culturally sensitive LLMs and provides tools for evaluation.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity
of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research.
Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a
region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However,
there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and
bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++,
a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating
LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we
introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation
with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consistency-driven prototype-prompting framework for Generalized Intent Discovery (GID), improving performance by integrating old and new knowledge while outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised intent detection struggles with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, and existing GID methods neglect domain adaptation.

Method: A prototype-prompting framework transfers old knowledge, and hierarchical consistency constraints learn new knowledge from target domains.

Result: The method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and generalizable, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs,
where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and
struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical
applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging
unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation.
However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while
neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven
prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old
and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for
transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical
consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We
conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method
significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of
our methods. Our source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for knowledge conflicts in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a benchmark (CONFLICTS) to evaluate how models handle such conflicts. Experiments show LLMs struggle with resolving conflicts, though reasoning prompts help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of conflicting information in retrieved sources for RAG and improve model behavior in handling such discrepancies.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of knowledge conflict types and introduces CONFLICTS, a benchmark with expert annotations. Tests LLMs on this benchmark with and without reasoning prompts.

Result: LLMs often fail to resolve conflicts appropriately, but explicit reasoning prompts improve response quality.

Conclusion: While progress is made, significant room for improvement remains in handling knowledge conflicts in RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned TTS models improves engagement and compatibility, leveraging advanced LLM reasoning without extra components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs like DeepSeek R1 and V3 enhances reasoning and persuasion, making them ideal for social deduction games like Werewolf.

Method: Proposes an LLM-based system with tuned TTS models for better compatibility and engagement, eliminating the need for extra components.

Result: Improved user engagement and compatibility with various LLM models.

Conclusion: Advanced LLM reasoning can replace additional components in Werewolf games, simplifying the system while enhancing the experience.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: Introduces CoMuMDR, a code-mixed multi-modal multi-domain corpus for discourse parsing, highlighting challenges for SoTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discourse parsing datasets are limited to single-domain written English dialogues, lacking diversity.

Method: Presents CoMuMDR, a Hindi-English code-mixed corpus with audio, text, and nine discourse relations, tested with SoTA models.

Result: SoTA models perform poorly, indicating challenges in multi-domain code-mixed settings.

Conclusion: Better models are needed for realistic, diverse discourse parsing tasks.

Abstract: Discourse parsing is an important task useful for NLU applications such as
summarization, machine comprehension, and emotion recognition. The current
discourse parsing datasets based on conversations consists of written English
dialogues restricted to a single domain. In this resource paper, we introduce
CoMuMDR: Code-mixed Multi-modal Multi-domain corpus for Discourse paRsing in
conversations. The corpus (code-mixed in Hindi and English) has both audio and
transcribed text and is annotated with nine discourse relations. We experiment
with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models
highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards
the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight post-training framework refines latent reasoning in LLMs using contrastive feedback and residual embedding refinement, achieving a 5% accuracy gain on MathQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Chain-of-Thought prompting (token overhead, fixed reasoning) and challenges in updating reasoning embeddings post-training.

Method: Proposes two strategies: contrastive reasoning feedback (compares embeddings against baselines) and residual embedding refinement (stabilizes updates with historical gradients).

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on five reasoning benchmarks, notably a 5% accuracy improvement on MathQA without extra training.

Conclusion: The framework successfully refines latent reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency in LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language
Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit
intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed
reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in
latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning
processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit
outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning
embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate
solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training
framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel
strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning
embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update
directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which
stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical
gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and
case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA
without additional training.

### [171] [Being Strong Progressively! Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05695)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a curriculum learning framework (POCL) for Knowledge Distillation (KD) in large language models (LLMs) to address distribution shifts, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for LLMs often cause distribution shifts, leading to issues like catastrophic forgetting and training-inference mismatch.

Method: POCL introduces a difficulty measurer to rank samples and a training scheduler to progressively introduce harder samples with rising loss temperatures.

Result: Experiments show POCL consistently improves student model performance across various KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: Sorted training samples enhance KD stability and performance, demonstrating the value of structured training data in LLM distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

*Tuukka Törö,Antti Suni,Juraj Šimko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses ML-derived speech embeddings to analyze relationships among 106 languages, finding alignment with traditional measures and highlighting potential for scalable linguistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore linguistic relationships globally using data-driven methods, complementing traditional approaches.

Method: Employs embeddings from a fine-tuned XLS-R model and LDA to cluster languages, comparing results with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances.

Result: Embedding-based distances align with traditional measures, capturing typological patterns, though visualization challenges persist.

Conclusion: The approach offers scalable analysis of language variation, with future work targeting underrepresented languages and sociolinguistic integration.

Abstract: Investigating linguistic relationships on a global scale requires analyzing
diverse features such as syntax, phonology and prosody, which evolve at varying
rates influenced by internal diversification, language contact, and
sociolinguistic factors. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer
complementary alternatives to traditional historical and typological
approaches. Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic
features, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation
through embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for
large-scale, data-driven analyses.
  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised
language identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze
relationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and
compared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances. The results
demonstrate that embedding-based distances align closely with traditional
measures, effectively capturing both global and local typological patterns.
Challenges in visualizing relationships, particularly with hierarchical
clustering and network-based methods, highlight the dynamic nature of language
change.
  The findings show potential for scalable analyses of language variation based
on speech embeddings, providing new perspectives on relationships among
languages. By addressing methodological considerations such as corpus size and
latent space dimensionality, this approach opens avenues for studying
low-resource languages and bridging macro- and micro-level linguistic
variation. Future work aims to extend these methods to underrepresented
languages and integrate sociolinguistic variation for a more comprehensive
understanding of linguistic diversity.

*Yahan Li,Jifan Yao,John Bosco S. Bunyi,Adam C. Frank,Angel Hwang,Ruishan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CounselBench evaluates LLMs in mental health counseling, finding they often outperform human therapists in quality but raise safety concerns. Human experts flag issues LLM judges miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test LLM behavior in realistic mental health counseling scenarios, addressing gaps in current evaluations.

Method: Developed CounselBench with 100 professionals, including CounselBench-EVAL (2,000 expert evaluations) and CounselBench-Adv (120 adversarial questions).

Result: LLMs outperform human therapists in perceived quality but show safety concerns. LLM judges overlook issues flagged by humans.

Conclusion: CounselBench provides a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking and improving LLMs in mental health.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental
health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains
largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed
with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in
single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000
expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human
therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six
clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level
annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in
perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety
concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that
LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues
identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct
CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling
questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880
responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns.
Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for
benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

*Liyan Xu,Zhenlin Su,Mo Yu,Jiangnan Li,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of text encoders in recognizing fine-grained entities or events, introduces a Chinese dataset (CapRetrieval) for evaluation, and proposes data generation strategies to improve performance, identifying a granularity dilemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and improve the ability of text encoders to recognize fine-grained semantics, which current embeddings often fail to capture.

Method: Introduces CapRetrieval, a Chinese dataset with image captions and queries. Evaluates encoders zero-shot, then finetunes them using proposed data generation strategies.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation shows encoders fail on fine-grained matching. Finetuning with proposed strategies achieves the best performance on CapRetrieval.

Conclusion: The work highlights the granularity dilemma in embeddings and provides a dataset and methods to address fine-grained semantic recognition.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in
this work are publicly released at https://github.com/lxucs/CapRetrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how MBTI-based personality traits influence hate speech detection in LLMs, revealing significant variations and biases in model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored impact of personality traits on LLM performance in subjective tasks like hate speech detection.

Method: Conducted a human annotation survey to confirm MBTI influence, then prompted four open-source LLMs with MBTI personas and evaluated their outputs on three hate speech datasets.

Result: Found substantial persona-driven variations, including inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level biases.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for careful persona prompt design in LLM workflows to ensure fairness and alignment with human values.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task,
with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has
examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of
personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona
prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human
annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling
behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI
personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our
analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including
inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level
biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts
in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment
with human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAISE is a retrieval-augmented framework for scientific reasoning, outperforming baselines by retrieving logically relevant documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific reasoning involves complex processes and domain-specific knowledge, requiring adaptive solutions.

Method: RAISE uses problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval to retrieve relevant documents.

Result: RAISE consistently outperforms baselines on scientific reasoning benchmarks by retrieving logically relevant documents.

Conclusion: RAISE effectively enhances scientific reasoning by combining domain knowledge with logical relevance.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but
also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated
findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce
RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically
relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps:
problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We
observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific
reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves
documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also
documents logically more relevant.

*Son The Nguyen,Theja Tulabandhula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEMETRON is a task-agnostic framework for LLM decoding, using metaheuristic algorithms to optimize responses without retraining, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM decoding strategies lack control and task-specific optimization, limiting performance and alignment with objectives.

Method: MEMETRON formulates decoding as black-box optimization, using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms (GENETRON, ANNETRON) guided by reward models and LLM operations.

Result: MEMETRON significantly outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, especially in human preference alignment.

Conclusion: MEMETRON offers a modular, efficient solution for improving LLM alignment and performance without retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and
structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated
by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking.
These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for
task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that
formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON
leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the
response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by
the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward
responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework
is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward
function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the
critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly
outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential
to improve alignment without model retraining.

*Mingyu Zheng,Zhifan Feng,Jia Wang,Lanrui Wang,Zheng Lin,Yang Hao,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableDreamer is a progressive, weakness-guided framework for synthesizing table instruction tuning data, addressing diversity and efficiency issues in LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based data synthesis methods lack diversity and ignore model weaknesses, leading to suboptimal table understanding performance.

Method: TableDreamer synthesizes diverse seed data and iteratively explores input space guided by identified weaknesses to create effective training data.

Result: The framework improves Llama3.1-8B-instruct's accuracy by 11.62% (49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K synthetic data, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: TableDreamer effectively enhances table instruction tuning by focusing on diversity and model weaknesses, achieving superior performance with less data.

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study interactions in the low-resource biomedical domain of the intestinal microbiome using generative RE.

Method: Leverages LLM summarization to refine context before extracting relations via instruction-tuned generation.

Result: Summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise, but BERT-based RE still outperforms.

Conclusion: Generative methods show promise for specialized, low-resource domains, though further development is needed.

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the
study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource
biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language
models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via
instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show
that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and
guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform
generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative
methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RuleReasoner, a reinforced rule-based reasoning method, outperforms large reasoning models (LRMs) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, offering computational efficiency and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of small reasoning models (SRMs) learning rule-based reasoning effectively across diverse tasks and domains, given the success of large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning (RL).

Method: Introduces RuleReasoner, which uses domain-aware dynamic sampling to resample training batches based on historical rewards, enabling domain augmentation and flexible RL learning schedules.

Result: Outperforms frontier LRMs by 4.1% on in-distribution tasks and 10.4% on out-of-distribution tasks, with higher computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RuleReasoner demonstrates that SRMs can achieve robust generalization and efficiency in rule-based reasoning, surpassing LRMs without relying on pre-engineered training recipes.

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses energy inefficiency in LLM inference by analyzing and reducing response length through prompt engineering, achieving 25-60% energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy consumption in LLM inference is high, and output compression is understudied. The paper aims to optimize energy use by reducing unnecessary response length.

Method: Benchmarked 12 decoder-only LLMs on 5 datasets, analyzed response quality, and tested prompt-engineering strategies for length reduction.

Result: Prompt engineering reduced response length significantly, achieving 25-60% energy savings without compromising response quality.

Conclusion: Simple prompt-engineering strategies can effectively optimize LLM energy use by reducing redundant information in responses.

Abstract: A significant portion of the energy consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
arises from their inference processes; hence developing energy-efficient
methods for inference is crucial. While several techniques exist for inference
optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few
preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12
decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce
responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a
comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six
information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend
to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To
address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and
intuitive prompt-engineering strategies. Empirical evaluation shows that
appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information
content can achieve significant energy optimization between 25-60\% by reducing
the response length while preserving the quality of LLM responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClimateViz is the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using charts, featuring 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations. Current models struggle with chart-based reasoning, performing below human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fact-checking focuses on text and tables, neglecting scientific charts, which are crucial for quantitative evidence.

Method: Introduces ClimateViz, a dataset with expert-curated charts and claims, evaluated using multimodal language models in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Result: Best models (Gemini 2.5, InternVL 2.5) achieve 76.2-77.8% accuracy, below human performance (89.3-92.7%). Explanation-augmented outputs help some models.

Conclusion: Chart-based fact-checking remains challenging for models, highlighting the need for improved multimodal reasoning. Dataset and code are publicly released.

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking
scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and
statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark
for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz
contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support,
refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example
includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,
and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,
including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:
even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to
77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3
and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some
models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

*Hee Suk Yoon,Eunseop Yoon,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Sungwoong Kim,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfPO is a lightweight, model-free method for preference learning in LLMs that optimizes preference-critical tokens based on training policy confidence, outperforming uniform methods like DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods like DPO adjust all token probabilities uniformly, leading to inefficiency and overoptimization. ConfPO aims to improve alignment by focusing on impactful tokens.

Method: ConfPO identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens using only the training policy's confidence, avoiding auxiliary models or extra compute.

Result: ConfPO outperforms uniform DAAs on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, achieving better alignment without additional computational cost.

Conclusion: ConfPO offers a simple, efficient, and scalable solution for preference learning in LLMs, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language
Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based
solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

*Fariz Ikhwantri,Dusica Marijan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EXCLAIM, an NLI-based approach for explainable compliance detection in assurance cases, addressing challenges like complex texts and limited data by using LLMs for case generation and multi-hop inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in validating assurance cases include complex legal/technical texts, need for explanations, and limited data access.

Method: EXCLAIM uses NLI for multi-hop inference, generates assurance cases with LLMs, and introduces coverage/consistency metrics.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with GDPR requirements, showing potential for automating compliance.

Conclusion: NLI-based approaches like EXCLAIM can automate and improve regulatory compliance processes.

Abstract: Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the
validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some
challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and
technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to
assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on
Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with
Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the
claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference
for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited
number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models
(LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural
consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case
from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our
results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the
regulatory compliance process.

*Mehedi Hasan Bijoy,Dejan Porjazovski,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel language-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation method improves multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) performance across English, Finnish, and French, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending monolingual SER to multilingual systems is challenging, necessitating a unified model for improved human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses Wav2Vec2.0 for monolingual teacher models and distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model.

Result: Achieves 72.9 weighted recall (English) and 63.4 unweighted recall (Finnish), outperforming baselines. Excels in sad/neutral emotions but struggles with anger/happiness.

Conclusion: The method advances multilingual SER but needs further improvement for certain emotions.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for improving human-computer
interaction. Despite strides in monolingual SER, extending them to build a
multilingual system remains challenging. Our goal is to train a single model
capable of multilingual SER by distilling knowledge from multiple teacher
models. To address this, we introduce a novel language-aware multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method to advance SER in English, Finnish, and French.
It leverages Wav2Vec2.0 as the foundation of monolingual teacher models and
then distills their knowledge into a single multilingual student model. The
student model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with a weighted recall
of 72.9 on the English dataset and an unweighted recall of 63.4 on the Finnish
dataset, surpassing fine-tuning and knowledge distillation baselines. Our
method excels in improving recall for sad and neutral emotions, although it
still faces challenges in recognizing anger and happiness.

*Nelvin Tan,Zian Seng,Liang Zhang,Yu-Ching Shih,Dong Yang,Amol Salunkhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of traditional critic agents in LLMs for financial numerical QA without oracle labels, introduces an improved critic agent and calculator agent, and studies their interaction effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with numerical QA in financial documents, especially without oracle labels, prompting the need for improved methods.

Method: The paper examines traditional critic agents, introduces an improved critic agent and calculator agent, and analyzes their interactions.

Result: The improved critic agent and calculator agent outperform the state-of-the-art program-of-thought method and are safer.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of agent interaction and presents a superior approach for financial numerical QA in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous
natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical
question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual
data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e.,
self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this
framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic
agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that
this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in
mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent
which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought)
and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each
other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

*Dror Kris Markus,Fabrizio Gilardi,Daria Stetsenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines AI research papers to assess the integration of ethical and societal values, finding that interdisciplinary teams still lead but technical teams are increasingly contributing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ethical and societal values are integrated into AI research and whether interdisciplinary collaboration drives this shift.

Method: Analyzed over 100,000 AI-related papers on ArXiv (2014-2024) using a classifier to identify societal content.

Result: Interdisciplinary teams produce more societally-oriented research, but technical teams are now contributing significantly, addressing fairness, safety, healthcare, and misinformation.

Conclusion: The findings challenge assumptions about societal AI drivers and raise questions about AI governance and the role of non-technical disciplines.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday
life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have
intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key
pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether
interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice.
This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between
2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are
integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify
societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these
considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain
more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only
teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output.
These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers
and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare
and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the
drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the
implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most
societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical
teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a
technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive
perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

TL;DR: A domain-specific LLM for nuclear applications, trained on a small dataset from the Essential CANDU textbook, shows promise in capturing nuclear vocabulary but needs improvements in coherence and dataset richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an in-house LLM for nuclear applications that adheres to cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards, addressing the need for specialized vocabulary and domain accuracy.

Method: Uses a compact Transformer-based architecture trained on a single GPU with a small dataset from the Essential CANDU textbook.

Result: The model captures specialized nuclear vocabulary but lacks syntactic coherence; early text generation shows utility for specialized tasks.

Conclusion: Feasibility of domain-specific LLMs is demonstrated, but future work requires richer corpora, better preprocessing, and fine-tuning for real-world nuclear applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nuclear industry has unstructured text data that is unusable for LLMs, which need structured Q&A pairs for tasks like training and evaluation.

Method: Uses synthetic data generation to convert existing text into Q&A pairs by leveraging LLMs to analyze, extract, and evaluate data.

Result: Enables robust LLM development for the nuclear domain, improving information retrieval, knowledge sharing, and decision-making.

Conclusion: Synthetic data unlocks LLM potential in the nuclear industry, solving data scarcity and privacy challenges.

Abstract: The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away
in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for
advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured
question-answer pairs for tasks like model training, fine-tuning, and
evaluation. This paper explores how synthetic data generation can bridge this
gap, enabling the development of robust LLMs for the nuclear domain. We discuss
the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear
industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing
text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text,
extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality
of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the
nuclear industry, synthetic data can pave the way for improved information
retrieval, enhanced knowledge sharing, and more informed decision-making in
this critical sector.

Result: Provides insights into the in-context learning abilities of LLMs for DST.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable findings on how demonstration selection and prompt context impact DST performance in LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores the application of in-context learning (ICL) to the
dialogue state tracking (DST) problem and investigates the factors that
influence its effectiveness. We use a sentence embedding based k-nearest
neighbour method to retrieve the suitable demonstrations for ICL. The selected
demonstrations, along with the test samples, are structured within a template
as input to the LLM. We then conduct a systematic study to analyse the impact
of factors related to demonstration selection and prompt context on DST
performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses
primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and

*Mishca de Costa,Muhammad Anwar,Dave Mercier,Mark Randall,Issam Hammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using function-calling LLMs instead of direct NL-to-SQL for nuclear plant data retrieval to improve accuracy and trust by leveraging pre-approved functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NL-to-SQL methods risk inaccuracies and lack transparency in critical nuclear plant data retrieval due to complex legacy databases.

Method: A hybrid approach using LLMs to invoke pre-approved functions with validated SQL logic, reducing direct NL-to-SQL risks.

Result: Improved accuracy and maintainability compared to direct NL-to-SQL, with expert-validated queries.

Conclusion: Balancing accessibility and safety, the function-based framework offers a robust solution for critical data retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks reasoning-focused LLMs, especially DeepSeek models, on Arabic NLP tasks, showing significant performance boosts with in-context examples and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLM performance on Arabic data, which is underexplored due to its complexity, and evaluate reasoning abilities across tasks.

Method: Uses zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning strategies on fifteen Arabic NLP tasks, comparing models like DeepSeek and GPT-4-mini.

Result: Key findings include a 13 F1 point boost with few-shot examples, DeepSeek outperforming GPT-4-mini by 12 F1 points, and LoRA fine-tuning adding 8 F1/BLEU points.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of in-context learning and fine-tuning for improving LLM performance on complex Arabic NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning
abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their
performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects,
and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis
on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP
tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on
datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for
linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments
reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context
examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification
tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection
from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures
outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on
complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning
yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent
increases in model scale. The code is available at

*Francisco Vargas,Alejandro González Coene,Gaston Escalante,Exequiel Lobón,Manuel Pulido*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-step method for extracting traffic accident details from legal documents outperforms classic methods, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving the highest accuracy (86.1%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting entities like disability percentages and compensation amounts from legal documents is complex and error-prone, even for experts.

Method: Proposes segmenting documents using regex or token blocks with semantic vectorization, then applying LLMs (LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, GPT-4 Turbo) for entity extraction, including fine-tuning with LoRA.

Result: Fine-tuning reduces hallucinations in LLaMA-2 7b. LLaMA-2 70B (79.4%) and LLaMA-3 8B (76.6%) perform well, but GPT-4 Turbo leads (86.1%).

Conclusion: The method improves accuracy significantly over classic approaches, with GPT-4 Turbo being the most effective, highlighting rapid advancements in LLMs.

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is
crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as
percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved
compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the
subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is
proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant
segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two
methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a
second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are
then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches
(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models
(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to
the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning
is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a
significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important
contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these
hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The
performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent
use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an
accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning
achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.
Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned
LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model
development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swiss German lacks standardized written form, and existing STT models struggle with spontaneous speech. The SRB-300 dataset addresses this gap by providing real-world conversational data.

Method: The authors fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset, which includes diverse Swiss German dialects and spontaneous speech.

Result: Fine-tuning improved WER by 19-33% and BLEU scores by 8-40%, with the best model achieving a WER of 17.1% and BLEU of 74.8.

Conclusion: The SRB-300 dataset and fine-tuned models advance STT systems for Swiss German and other low-resource languages in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Swiss German is a low-resource language represented by diverse dialects that
differ significantly from Standard German and from each other, lacking a
standardized written form. As a result, transcribing Swiss German involves
translating into Standard German. Existing datasets have been collected in
controlled environments, yielding effective speech-to-text (STT) models, but
these models struggle with spontaneous conversational speech.
  This paper, therefore, introduces the new SRB-300 dataset, a 300-hour
annotated speech corpus featuring real-world long-audio recordings from 39
Swiss German radio and TV stations. It captures spontaneous speech across all
major Swiss dialects recorded in various realistic environments and overcomes
the limitation of prior sentence-level corpora.
  We fine-tuned multiple OpenAI Whisper models on the SRB-300 dataset,
achieving notable enhancements over previous zero-shot performance metrics.
Improvements in word error rate (WER) ranged from 19% to 33%, while BLEU scores
increased between 8% and 40%. The best fine-tuned model, large-v3, achieved a
WER of 17.1% and a BLEU score of 74.8. This advancement is crucial for
developing effective and robust STT systems for Swiss German and other
low-resource languages in real-world contexts.

TL;DR: The paper exposes a geometric blind spot in LLM alignment, introduces ALKALI (an adversarial benchmark), and proposes GRACE (a mitigation framework) to reduce attack success rates by 39%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial threats against LLMs are outpacing defenses, exploiting latent camouflage to evade detection.

Method: Introduces ALKALI benchmark and GRACE framework, which enforces latent space constraints via geometric regularization.

Result: Evaluation shows high attack success rates; GRACE reduces ASR by up to 39%.

Conclusion: GRACE and AVQI offer effective tools to mitigate latent camouflage and improve LLM safety.

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant science lacks domain-adapted language models, unlike biomedical and clinical NLP. PlantBert addresses this gap.

Method: Built on DeBERTa, PlantBert combines transformer modeling with rule-enhanced post-processing and ontology-based normalization.

Result: PlantBert shows strong generalization and precision in capturing biologically meaningful relationships.

Conclusion: PlantBert bridges a gap in agricultural NLP, enabling scalable, reproducible knowledge extraction and fostering innovation in plant science.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed
breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however,
plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In
this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model
specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant
stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its
disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned
on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary
focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic
stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with
rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity
normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful
relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is
annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology,
encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of
plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across
entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in
low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible
framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical
gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems
in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is
publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary
innovation in computational plant science.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using LLMs transforms legal texts into Defeasible Deontic Logic, showing promising results in formalizing legal norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate semantic analysis of legal texts and scale legal informatics using LLMs.

Method: A structured pipeline segments legal texts, extracts deontic rules, and evaluates coherence, tested across LLM configurations.

Result: LLMs, especially with effective prompting, align well with expert-crafted formalizations.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly aid scalable legal informatics when properly utilized.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts
using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal
representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured
pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets,
extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic
coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations,
including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage
pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications
Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment
between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs
- particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to
scalable legal informatics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dialect-to-standard normalization method combining rule-based transformations and LLMs with few-shot prompting, applied to Greek dialects and evaluated on proverbs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of low-resource languages and dialects by enabling standard-language tools to process dialectal text.

Method: Combines rule-based linguistically informed transformations and LLMs with few-shot prompting, requiring no parallel data.

Result: Human evaluation shows effectiveness; downstream experiments reveal previous reliance on superficial linguistic information, with new semantic insights possible.

Conclusion: The method successfully normalizes dialectal text, uncovering deeper semantic insights beyond orthographic artifacts.

Abstract: Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages,
including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard
normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so
that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we
tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines
rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models
(LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data.
We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of
regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use
this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results
regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information,
including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made
through the remaining semantics.

TL;DR: PropMEND, a hypernetwork-based approach, improves knowledge propagation in LLMs for multi-hop reasoning, outperforming existing methods on RippleEdit and Controlled RippleEdit datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge editing techniques for LLMs fail to propagate injected knowledge for reasoning tasks, limiting their utility.

Method: PropMEND meta-learns gradient modifications to enable multi-hop reasoning with injected knowledge, extending MEND's meta-objective.

Result: PropMEND achieves nearly 2x accuracy on multi-hop questions in RippleEdit and performs well on unseen relations in Controlled RippleEdit.

Conclusion: PropMEND advances knowledge propagation but shows room for improvement in generalizing to unseen relations, suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the prohibitive computational resources typically required for training large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning, making high-performance AI research more accessible.

Method: Integrates reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques to train a 1.5B parameter model on a single gaming GPU (RTX 3080 Ti).

Result: The model performs comparably or better than larger models on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, despite limited hardware.

Conclusion: Challenges the notion that state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning requires massive infrastructure, democratizing access to high-performance AI.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end
hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming
GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating
reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing
access to high-performance AI research.

### [201] [FaithfulRAG: Fact-Level Conflict Modeling for Context-Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08938)
*Qinggang Zhang,Zhishang Xiang,Yilin Xiao,Le Wang,Junhui Li,Xinrun Wang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FaithfulRAG is a new framework addressing unfaithfulness in retrieval-augmented LLMs by modeling knowledge conflicts and integrating conflicting facts before response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suppress LLMs' parametric knowledge to enforce faithfulness, risking misinterpretation and undermining internal knowledge.

Method: FaithfulRAG identifies fact-level conflicts and uses a self-thinking process to reason and integrate conflicting facts.

Result: FaithfulRAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively resolves knowledge conflicts while preserving LLMs' parametric knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have
demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating
outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it
with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases
of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s
parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict
context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding
strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve
faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which
undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of
misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a
novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling
discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context.
Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level
and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and
integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is
available at https:// github.com/DeepLearnXMU/Faithful-RAG

*Clara Lachenmaier,Judith Sieker,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs handle common ground in political discourse, especially when dealing with misinformation, and finds challenges in their ability to correct false beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' role in conversational grounding and their effectiveness in mitigating misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive contexts.

Method: Evaluated LLMs' responses to direct knowledge questions and loaded questions with presupposed misinformation, assessing their grounding behavior and political bias.

Result: LLMs struggle with active grounding and correcting false beliefs, indicating limitations in their ability to combat political misinformation.

Conclusion: The study raises concerns about LLMs' effectiveness in political discourse and their potential to propagate misinformation.

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing
interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect
knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper
investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases
where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain
where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the
ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that
presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to
engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to
their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight
significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false
user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in
political discourse.

*Marek Kadlčík,Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel probing technique reveals that pretrained LMs accurately represent numbers, and aligning embeddings with this pattern can reduce arithmetic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained LMs often make arithmetic errors, and existing probing methods fail to capture the sinusoidal patterns in number embeddings.

Method: Proposed a new probing technique to decode numeric values from embeddings with high accuracy, revealing precise number representations in LMs.

Result: The probe achieves near-perfect accuracy, showing LMs represent numbers precisely post-pre-training. Embedding precision explains arithmetic errors.

Conclusion: Aligning embeddings with the discovered pattern mitigates arithmetic errors, proving the effectiveness of the new probing method.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

*Yuan Guo,Tingjia Miao,Zheng Wu,Pengzhou Cheng,Ming Zhou,Zhuosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UI-NEXUS is a benchmark for evaluating mobile agents on compositional tasks, revealing performance gaps. AGENT-NEXUS, a proposed scheduling system, improves task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on atomic tasks, neglecting compositional tasks crucial for real-world applications.

Method: UI-NEXUS benchmark evaluates agents on three compositional operations. AGENT-NEXUS dynamically decomposes tasks into atomic subtasks.

Result: Existing agents struggle with compositional tasks. AGENT-NEXUS improves success rates by 24% to 40%.

Conclusion: AGENT-NEXUS effectively addresses the atomic-to-compositional generalization gap in mobile agents.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been
developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work
has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks
and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to
compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This
work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile
agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,
Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in
20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online
Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates
with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a
range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that
UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents
generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting
representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and
attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.
Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient
scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS
extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing
long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS
achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on
compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without
significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study language variability in bilingual speech from phonetic and technological perspectives.

Method: Creation of the FROST-EMA corpus with 18 bilingual speakers producing L1, L2, and fake accent speech, followed by two case studies.

Result: Demonstrated impact of L2 and fake accent on speaker verification and articulatory patterns.

Conclusion: The FROST-EMA corpus is a valuable resource for bilingual speech research, with applications in both phonetics and technology.

Abstract: We introduce a new FROST-EMA (Finnish and Russian Oral Speech Dataset of
Electromagnetic Articulography) corpus. It consists of 18 bilingual speakers,
who produced speech in their native language (L1), second language (L2), and
imitated L2 (fake foreign accent). The new corpus enables research into
language variability from phonetic and technological points of view.
Accordingly, we include two preliminary case studies to demonstrate both
perspectives. The first case study explores the impact of L2 and imitated L2 on
the performance of an automatic speaker verification system, while the second
illustrates the articulatory patterns of one speaker in L1, L2, and a fake
accent.

*Yuejiao Wang,Xianmin Gong,Xixin Wu,Patrick Wong,Hoi-lam Helene Fung,Man Wai Mak,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel language-related fMRI task was developed for early detection of cognitive decline in older adults, achieving high accuracy (AUC 0.86) using machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of neurocognitive disorder (NCD) is vital for timely intervention, especially in aging populations.

Method: A naturalistic language-related fMRI task was tested on 97 non-demented Chinese older adults, with machine learning models analyzing fMRI features and demographics.

Result: The model achieved an AUC of 0.86, with key features from language-processing brain regions like the superior temporal gyrus.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of language-related fMRI for early NCD detection.

Abstract: Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and
slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and
significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has
suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for
this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented
Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning
classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and
demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under
the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as
NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test).
Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected
by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with
language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the
naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related
cognitive decline and NCD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, is used with transformer models to classify child vocalizations, outperforming previous datasets and achieving human-like accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of child speech recognition due to limited training data and unique speech characteristics.

Method: Applied transformer models to the SpeechMaturity dataset, which includes diverse, ecologically-valid child vocalizations from multiple languages and regions.

Result: Models achieved high classification accuracy, comparable to humans, and robustness across urban and rural settings.

Conclusion: The SpeechMaturity dataset and transformer models significantly improve child vocalization classification, surpassing prior benchmarks.

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child
speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech
pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer
models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child
vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally
ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample,
comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu,
Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004
labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were
trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and
immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset
outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved
classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and
urban settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SWE-Flow is a TDD-based data synthesis framework that generates incremental development steps from unit tests, creating verifiable TDD tasks and a benchmark (SWE-Flow-Eval).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software engineering data relies on human-submitted issues, lacking automation and structure. SWE-Flow addresses this by inferring development steps directly from unit tests.

Method: SWE-Flow constructs a Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG) to capture function interactions, generating structured development schedules with partial codebases, tests, and modifications.

Result: The framework produced 16,061 training and 2,020 test instances, improving TDD-based coding performance when fine-tuning models.

Conclusion: SWE-Flow automates TDD task generation, enhances model performance, and provides open resources for further research.

Abstract: We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in
Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that
rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental
development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate
high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a
Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions,
enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*.
At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit
tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD
tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020
test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval**
benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset
significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further
research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at
[Github](https://github.com/Hambaobao/SWE-Flow).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the consistency and accuracy of morphosyntactic annotations in L2 Korean by aligning XPOS and UPOS categories.

Method: Introduces a semi-automated framework for XPOS-UPOS alignment, expands the L2-Korean corpus with 2,998 sentences, and evaluates impact using NLP toolkits.

Result: Aligned dataset improves annotation consistency and enhances tagging and parsing accuracy, especially with limited data.

Conclusion: XPOS-UPOS alignment significantly benefits L2 Korean morphosyntactic analysis, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations
for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that
identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those
constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing
L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays.
To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean
morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these
alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned
dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also
enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly
in cases of limited annotated data.

TL;DR: A compact LLM called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA) is trained to aggregate multiple samples for improved accuracy, outperforming other test-time scaling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance gains in LLMs by leveraging multiple samples more effectively than heuristic aggregation methods.

Method: Train SSA to concatenate and analyze multiple samples, optimizing for accuracy using reinforcement learning.

Result: SSA outperforms methods like reward model-based re-ranking and generalizes well across tasks and model scales.

Conclusion: SSA offers an efficient way to aggregate samples, compatible with black-box models, and improves reasoning task performance.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large
language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically
aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using
verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in
math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple
sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that
takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer,
optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments
on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time
scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows
a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model
families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs
to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the
outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the effectiveness and consistency of human and LLM proofreading in enhancing second language writing intelligibility.

Method: Examined lexical and syntactic interventions in identical second language writings by humans and three LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b).

Result: Both human and LLM proofreading improved bigram lexical features. LLMs were more generative, using diverse vocabulary and complex sentence structures. Outcomes were consistent across LLMs.

Conclusion: LLM proofreading is effective and consistent, offering generative improvements over human proofreading in certain aspects.

Abstract: This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM
proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second
language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs
(ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and
LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to
better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,
LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking
vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and
sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective
modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in
major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

*Haozhen Zhang,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Router-R1 is an RL-based framework for multi-LLM routing, leveraging sequential decision-making to optimize performance-cost trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routers lack the ability to handle complex tasks requiring multiple LLMs' complementary strengths.

Method: Router-R1 uses reinforcement learning, interleaving deliberation and dynamic model invocation, with a lightweight rule-based reward system.

Result: Outperforms baselines on QA benchmarks, balancing performance and cost.

Conclusion: Router-R1 offers robust generalization and cost-effective multi-LLM routing.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance gap between visual and textual tasks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), attributing it to disjoint circuits and late alignment of image representations. A simple intervention—patching visual tokens from later layers into earlier ones—reduces the gap by a third.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs perform better on textual tasks compared to analogous visual tasks and to explore ways to bridge this gap without additional training.

Method: Identifies and compares task-specific circuits (computational sub-graphs) in VLMs for different modalities. Proposes patching visual data tokens from later layers into earlier layers to improve alignment.

Result: The intervention closes a third of the performance gap between modalities on average, as demonstrated in experiments with multiple tasks and models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and offers a training-free method to mitigate it by aligning visual and textual representations earlier in processing.

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions
on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher
accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a
text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the
\textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different
modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between
modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences
lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a
text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they
become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations
only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence
subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual
data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with
multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the
performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on
the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach
for reducing it.

*Fei Li,Song Liu,Weiguo Wu,Shiqiang Nie,Jinyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVmix is a mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache in LLMs, dynamically allocating precision based on importance, achieving high memory compression and speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high memory demands of KV Cache in LLMs limit deployment in resource-constrained platforms, necessitating efficient quantization methods.

Method: KVmix uses gradient-based importance analysis for layer-specific bit-width allocation and dynamic long-context optimization to prioritize critical KV pairs.

Result: Achieves near-lossless performance with 2.19bit Key and 2.38bit Value, 4.9x memory compression, and 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

Conclusion: KVmix effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, enabling efficient LLM deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

Motivation: To identify localized displacement patterns obscured in broader regional/national statistics.

Method: Integrates UNHCR ProGres data, Google Open Buildings, and OpenStreetMap Populated Places with a label spreading algorithm.

Result: 92.9% accuracy in placing refugee observations, enabling high-resolution displacement pattern analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a foundation for deeper understanding of displacement drivers.

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics
from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan
African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with
satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location
coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm
creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This
methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee
observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of
localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and

*Zi-Ying Chen,Chuan-Xian Ren,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to address partial domain adaptation by simultaneously characterizing sample-wise and class-wise relations, improving outlier identification and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weighting frameworks for partial domain adaptation inadequately explore cluster structures and are sensitive to inaccurate predictions, leading to confusion with outlier classes.

Method: The BUOT model integrates sample-level and class-level transport in a unified framework, using a cooperation mechanism to enhance structure and discriminative information for alignment and outlier identification.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show BUOT's competitiveness in addressing partial domain adaptation.

Conclusion: BUOT effectively tackles the limitations of existing methods by unifying sample-wise and class-wise relations, providing a robust solution for partial domain adaptation.

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational costs of traditional CFD methods and limited transferability of existing deep learning models in flow field prediction.

Method: Integrates POD dimensionality reduction with fine-tuned pretrained LLM, using fluid dynamics-oriented text templates for enriched context.

Result: Outperforms conventional models in few-shot learning, generalizes well across conditions, reduces prediction time to seconds with >90% accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers rapid, accurate fluid dynamics prediction, with potential applications in aerodynamics and engineering.

Abstract: This study proposes a universal flow field prediction framework based on
knowledge transfer
  from large language model (LLM), addressing the high computational costs of
traditional
  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and the limited cross-condition
transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates
Proper Orthogonal
  Decomposition (POD) dimensionality reduction with fine-tuning strategies for
pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while
the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's
adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that
improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot
learning scenarios while
  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and
airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT
architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation,
our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed
knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction,
with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other
engineering domains.

*Chenxi Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Ruibo Chen,Yihan Wu,Junfeng Guo,Tianyi Zhou,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MBPO addresses modality imbalance in LMMs by generating hard negatives and using online responses with verified rewards, improving performance and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs suffer from modality imbalance, favoring language over vision, limiting generalization and causing hallucinations. Existing methods don't address LLM biases or dynamic data shifts.

Method: MBPO creates an offline dataset with hard negatives via adversarial image perturbations and uses online responses with verified rewards, combining them with GRPO for training.

Result: MBPO improves LMM performance on vision-language tasks and reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: MBPO effectively balances modalities in LMMs, enhancing their reasoning and reducing biases.

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

*Asit Mishra,Dusan Stosic,Simon Layton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Precision scaling with MX formats improves GPU efficiency but requires careful rounding modes for LLM pre-training. An improved rounding mode (round-to-infinity) enables successful MXFP8 pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of numeric stability and convergence in precision scaling for LLM pre-training using MX formats.

Method: Analyzed the impact of rounding modes in MXFP8, proposing round-to-infinity for scaling factors.

Result: Demonstrated successful pre-training of an 8B model on 15T tokens using the improved rounding mode.

Conclusion: Careful selection of rounding modes is critical for successful precision scaling in LLM pre-training.

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

TL;DR: ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network, predicts AV crash severity with 97.74% accuracy using coarse-grained spatial aggregation and multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AV crash severity dynamics is crucial for urban safety and infrastructure planning.

Method: Uses fine-grained and coarse-grained spatial graphs with multimodal data (e.g., geospatial, temporal, textual embeddings) and evaluates GNN architectures like GCN, GAT, and DSTGCN.

Result: ST-GraphNet (DSTGCN on coarse-grained H3 graph) achieves 97.74% test accuracy, outperforming fine-grained models (64.7%).

Conclusion: Spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multimodal integration effectively capture spatio-temporal patterns in AV crash severity.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV)
crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and
infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV
crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs.
Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from
Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE
automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary
graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as
nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a
coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical
Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal
adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including
semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from
crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various
graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN
(DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our
proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3
graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the
best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal
feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns
underlying AV crash severity.

*Yiming Wang,Hao Peng,Senzhang Wang,Haohua Du,Chunyang Liu,Jia Wu,Guanlin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAMImputer is a novel SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of Experts network for traffic data imputation, addressing block-wise missing data and dynamic spatial correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with block-wise missing data and static graph structures, limiting flexibility for nonstationary traffic data.

Method: Proposes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework for spatio-temporal feature extraction and a dynamic LrSGAT mechanism for adaptive spatial correlations.

Result: STAMImputer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four traffic datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively handles missing data and dynamic spatial relationships, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at

*Asankhaya Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) capabilities in large language models can be approximated using inference-time techniques like in-context learning (ICL), without modifying model parameters, under idealized and practical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational intensity of SFT by showing that similar capabilities can be achieved through inference-time methods, making deployment more resource-efficient.

Method: Theoretical analysis under idealized assumptions (unbounded resources, full dataset access) and extension to practical scenarios (finite context, partial dataset). Mathematical bounds are derived for dataset sizes required to approximate SFT behavior.

Result: For text generation and linear classification tasks, specific dataset sizes suffice to approximate fine-tuned behavior within error bounds, leveraging the Turing completeness of transformers.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical basis for efficient deployment of large language models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging theory to real-world use.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairDICE is the first offline MORL framework optimizing nonlinear welfare objectives, outperforming baselines in fairness-aware performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear scalarization in MORL fails to address fairness-oriented goals like Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, especially in offline settings.

Method: FairDICE uses distribution correction estimation for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, avoiding explicit preference weights.

Result: FairDICE achieves strong fairness-aware performance across offline benchmarks.

Conclusion: FairDICE successfully unifies and optimizes nonlinear welfare criteria in offline MORL, offering stable and sample-efficient learning.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: Lite-RVFL is a lightweight, efficient method for adapting to concept drift in online learning without retraining or drift detection, using an exponential weighting strategy for recent data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift challenges online learning reliability; existing methods are computationally costly and unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: Proposes Lite-RVFL with a novel objective function that exponentially weights new samples, enabling drift adaptation without retraining.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation shows Lite-RVFL's efficiency, effectiveness in drift adaptation, and ability to capture temporal patterns.

Conclusion: Lite-RVFL offers a practical solution for real-time concept drift adaptation, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses
a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing
methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which
demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient
random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of
adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL
introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially
increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely
adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective
function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is
derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate
the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture
temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Info-Coevolution is a framework for efficient dataset construction by selectively annotating and integrating data, reducing costs by 32% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies in dataset construction and training due to redundant data annotation, aiming to reduce costs and bias.

Method: Proposes Info-Coevolution, a framework for online selective annotation, leveraging task-specific models to coevolve models and data.

Result: Reduces annotation and training costs by 32% on ImageNet-1K, with further reduction to 50% using semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution efficiently improves datasets and reduces costs without performance loss, offering a scalable solution for real-world data challenges.

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

*Timothée Hornek Amir Sartipi,Igor Tchappi,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarking pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) against traditional methods for electricity price forecasting (EPF) reveals Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE as top TSFMs, but the biseasonal MSTL model outperforms all.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate EPF is vital for power trading, but the effectiveness of advanced TSFMs remains uncertain.

Method: Benchmarked TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, TimeGPT) against traditional methods using 2024 DAA prices from multiple European countries.

Result: Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE performed well, but MSTL, capturing daily/weekly seasonality, was consistently superior.

Conclusion: TSFMs show promise but don't surpass traditional models like MSTL for EPF.

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

*Hanbing Liu,Lang Cao,Yuanyi Ren,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Xiaojun Ma,Shi Han,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bingo is an RL framework designed to improve reasoning efficiency in large language models by using significance-aware and dynamic length rewards, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in language models' reasoning outputs, where existing RL methods focus on accuracy but neglect efficiency, and direct length-based rewards harm accuracy.

Method: Introduces Bingo with two mechanisms: significance-aware length reward (reduces insignificant tokens) and dynamic length reward (encourages detailed reasoning initially, then decays for efficiency).

Result: Bingo outperforms vanilla and other length-based RL rewards, improving both accuracy and efficiency across reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Training LLMs explicitly for efficient reasoning is promising, as demonstrated by Bingo's success in balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

*Aviad Susman,Mayte Suárez-Fariñas,Joseph T Colonel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a differentiable proxy for k-NN regression, called NONA, to integrate traditional algorithms into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of neural networks, improving performance over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional predictors like k-NN often outperform neural networks' dense layers on SFT embeddings, suggesting their direct incorporation into SFT could enhance performance. However, their non-differentiability poses a challenge.

Method: The authors introduce NONA, a regression layer mimicking k-NN using neural network attention and a learned attention-masking scheme, making it differentiable.

Result: NONA outperforms both dense layer prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings in regression tasks across multiple unstructured datasets.

Conclusion: NONA successfully bridges the gap between traditional algorithms and neural networks, offering a differentiable solution for improved performance in supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Motivation: Addressing data scarcity in AI-driven scientific discovery by automating the collection of high-quality coding tasks.

Method: AutoSDT uses LLMs to search, validate, and synthesize coding tasks, creating the AutoSDT-5K dataset.

Result: AutoSDT-5K contains 5,404 tasks with high validity (93%) and correctness (92.2%). AutoSDT-Coder models show significant benchmark improvements.

Conclusion: AutoSDT effectively tackles data scarcity, enhancing AI performance in scientific discovery, with results rivaling GPT-4o.

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness in decision-making algorithms, particularly ensuring proportional representation of demographic groups in clustering.

Method: Proposes Fair SC using a DC framework, a novel variable augmentation strategy, and an adapted ADMM-type algorithm for efficient subproblem solving.

Result: Demonstrates significant computational speedups over prior methods, especially for larger problem sizes, on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fair SC advances fair clustering for real-world applications by improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In
this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints,
where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as
in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral
clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of
convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable
augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated
subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational
efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive
eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant
speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size
grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the
adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.

TL;DR: A neural network framework with Fourier features and NODEs identifies mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without closed-form constitutive equations, validated by numerical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying mechanical properties in heterogeneous materials without relying on predefined constitutive equations.

Method: Uses a neural network with Fourier features for strain field approximation and NODEs for constitutive equation discovery, optimized via a multi-objective loss function.

Result: Demonstrates robustness in identifying mechanical properties under various conditions, including noise and experimental data.

Conclusion: The framework is a robust, general alternative to classical inverse methods for heterogeneous material analysis.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of

digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field
is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to
effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven
method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to
discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary
materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations
by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the
input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based
constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by
minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for
violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and
the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with
several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in
material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material
identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to
experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is
robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous
materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to
classical inverse methods.

*Hadi Reisizadeh,Jinghan Jia,Zhiqi Bu,Bhanukiran Vinzamuri,Anil Ramakrishna,Kai-Wei Chang,Volkan Cevher,Sijia Liu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bi-level optimization method (BLUR) for unlearning in LLMs, prioritizing forget loss over retain loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring compliance with data regulations and ethical AI practices by effectively unlearning specific knowledge in LLMs without degrading overall performance.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical bi-level optimization formulation: lower-level minimizes forget loss, upper-level maintains model utility. BLUR algorithm implements this.

Result: BLUR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms across tasks, models, and metrics.

Conclusion: BLUR provides a theoretically sound and practically superior solution for unlearning in LLMs, addressing the trade-off between forget and retain losses.

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities
acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data
regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there
are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains
unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular
formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads
to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and
retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the
hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem
(which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority
over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical
structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the
lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the
upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new
formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning
(\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but
more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the
state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and
metrics. Codes are available at

*Sunny Gupta,Nikita Jangid,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniVarFL is a new FL framework addressing non-IID data issues by using two regularization strategies to mimic IID-like training, improving accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) struggles with non-IID data due to local classifier bias. Existing solutions are costly or ineffective.

Method: UniVarFL employs Classifier Variance Regularization and Hyperspherical Uniformity Regularization during local training to align distributions and enhance generalization.

Result: UniVarFL outperforms existing methods in accuracy on benchmark datasets, proving scalable and efficient.

Conclusion: UniVarFL is a promising solution for real-world FL, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

### [234] [Federated Learning on Stochastic Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08169)
*Jingqiao Tang,Ryan Bausback,Feng Bao,Richard Archibald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Federated Stochastic Neural Networks to handle latent noise in federated learning by using stochastic neural networks as local models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning's susceptibility to latent noise in client data due to limited measurement capabilities or human errors.

Method: Incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models within federated learning to estimate true data states and quantify noise.

Result: Numerical experiments show effectiveness, especially with non-independent and identically distributed data.

Conclusion: Federated Stochastic Neural Networks improve federated learning by addressing latent noise and enhancing data state estimation.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages edge
computing on client devices to optimize models while maintaining user privacy
by ensuring that local data remains on the device. However, since all data is
collected by clients, federated learning is susceptible to latent noise in
local datasets. Factors such as limited measurement capabilities or human
errors may introduce inaccuracies in client data. To address this challenge, we
propose the use of a stochastic neural network as the local model within the
federated learning framework. Stochastic neural networks not only facilitate
the estimation of the true underlying states of the data but also enable the
quantification of latent noise. We refer to our federated learning approach,
which incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models, as Federated
stochastic neural networks. We will present numerical experiments demonstrating
the performance and effectiveness of our method, particularly in handling
non-independent and identically distributed data.

*Anh V Nguyen,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm-based approach for building personalized decision trees in Federated Learning, accommodating both categorical and numerical data for classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the understudied area of non-parametric models like decision trees in Federated Learning, and overcoming limitations of existing methods restricted to classification trees and categorical data.

Method: Utilizes Genetic Algorithm to construct personalized decision trees, enabling support for both categorical and numerical data in classification and regression tasks.

Result: The method outperforms locally trained decision trees and a benchmark algorithm in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully extends Federated Learning to personalized decision trees, accommodating diverse data types and tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning
has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the
aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the
current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric
counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing
methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a
greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global
model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and
categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper,
we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to
facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate
categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and
regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark
algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper explores correlated noise mechanisms for differential privacy (DP) in AI/ML model training, showing improved privacy-utility trade-offs compared to independent noise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy-utility trade-offs in DP by leveraging correlated noise, addressing limitations of independent noise mechanisms in stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Method: Introduces correlated noise (e.g., matrix mechanisms, DP-FTRL) to cancel noise across training steps, applied to weighted prefix sums estimation.

Result: Correlated noise mechanisms improve privacy-utility trade-offs and are deployed at scale in industry.

Conclusion: Correlated noise mechanisms are effective for private AI/ML training, offering practical advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise
mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to
private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of
estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject
independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning
algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body
of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the
noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully
canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps.
Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms,
factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when
applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with
industrial deployment at a global scale.

*Shadab Anwar Shaikh,Kranthi Balusu,Ayoub Soulami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) is proposed to infer full-field residual stresses from limited measurements, reducing experimental effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual stresses degrade performance, and full-field characterization is impractical due to high experimental effort.

Method: A U-Net-based ML model was trained on a dataset from process simulations, followed by hyperparameter tuning and validation on experimental data.

Result: The model achieved excellent predictive accuracy and generalization, successfully learning residual stress distribution patterns.

Conclusion: The RSG effectively predicts residual stresses from limited data, offering a practical solution to reduce experimental workload.

Abstract: Residual stresses, which remain within a component after processing, can
deteriorate performance. Accurately determining their full-field distributions
is essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However,
the experimental effort required for full-field characterization is
impractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML)
based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited
measurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing
numerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on
U-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through
systematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate
simulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual
characterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of
simulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and
exhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it
successfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The
RSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights
the feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive
understanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements,
thereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.

*Shahaf Bassan,Guy Amir,Meirav Zehavi,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interpretability of ensemble models using computational complexity theory, revealing nuanced patterns influenced by factors like the number, size, and type of base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the folklore recognition of ensemble models as black-boxes, there's a lack of rigorous mathematical understanding of what makes them interpretable.

Method: The study applies computational complexity theory to analyze the challenges of generating explanations for various ensemble configurations.

Result: Findings show that interpreting ensembles is often intractable, with complexity varying by factors like the number of base models (e.g., small tree ensembles are interpretable, but linear model ensembles are not).

Conclusion: The work provides a robust foundation for understanding ensemble interpretability, highlighting the value of a computational complexity perspective.

Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited
interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered
interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as
black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of
rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble
(un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*,
(2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In
this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational
complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for
various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity
patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under
standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains
intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the
complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles
of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles
with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe
that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the
interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through
a computational complexity lens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mondrian introduces a transformer-based operator learning method for PDEs, using domain decomposition to scale attention efficiently across high-resolution, multiscale domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling transformer-based operator models for PDEs is challenging due to quadratic attention costs and discretization coupling.

Method: Mondrian decomposes domains into non-overlapping subdomains, applies attention over subdomain-restricted functions, and uses neural operators within subdomains.

Result: Mondrian achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, scaling resolution without retraining.

Conclusion: Domain-decomposed attention shows promise for scalable, general-purpose neural operators.

Abstract: Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential
equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling
transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains
remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to
discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that
decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over
sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain
decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each
subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and
attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over
functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and
neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian
achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating
resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of
domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling laws for encoder-decoder transformer models in autonomous driving, showing performance improves with compute and data scaling, and discusses optimal model and dataset size ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaling compute, model size, and dataset size impacts performance in joint motion forecasting and planning for autonomous driving.

Method: Empirical study using a 500K-hour driving dataset, analyzing power-law scaling of compute, model parameters, and data size, and evaluating closed-loop metrics.

Result: Performance improves with compute scaling; optimal model size grows 1.5x faster than dataset size. Smaller models with sampling can compete with larger ones up to a point.

Conclusion: Optimizing scaling properties is crucial for performance in diverse driving scenarios, and leveraging general logged data can address data scarcity.

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability, accuracy, and fairness of LLM-extracted clinical data for research, regulatory, and clinical applications.

Method: Proposes a multidimensional framework integrating benchmarking, automated checks, replication analyses, and bias assessment.

Result: Identifies variables needing improvement, detects latent errors, and confirms dataset fitness-for-purpose.

Conclusion: The framework advances standards for trustworthy AI-powered evidence generation in oncology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random augmentation is inexpensive but suboptimal due to limited generalization effects and feature distortion from colliding augmentations.

Method: Proposes a solution to address the stochastic nature of random augmentation, mitigating feature distortion and improving generalization.

Result: The proposed method shows strong generalization performance across single source domain generalization (sDG) benchmarks.

Conclusion: Random augmentation can be improved to match or exceed the performance of costly targeted augmentations by addressing its inherent issues.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution
generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of
the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its
generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is
deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random
augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the
stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding
augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic
forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization
effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong
generalization performance across various single source domain generalization
(sDG) benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using Signal Temporal Logic (STL) improves LLM confidence calibration in mathematical reasoning by modeling stepwise confidence and enforcing temporal properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce incorrect but confident outputs, risking reliability in critical domains like education.

Method: Proposes a structured framework using STL to model stepwise confidence, enforce temporal constraints, and reshape uncertainty.

Result: Improves calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than conventional methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLM reliability by addressing overconfidence and improving interpretability of confidence estimates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in
mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which
poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the
expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured
framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it
using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based
constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness
scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our
approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce
smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning
trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves
calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than
conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.

TL;DR: A zero-parameter method for approximate equivariance in neural networks, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant methods are computationally intensive and architecture-specific. This work aims to simplify equivariance by using a loss penalty.

Method: Proposes a zero-parameter approach with an additional loss term to impose approximate equivariance, learning group representations in latent space.

Result: Experiments show the network prefers the regular representation, achieving similar or better performance than existing methods with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a simpler, parameter-efficient way to achieve equivariance, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

*Patryk Krukowski,Łukasz Gorczyca,Piotr Helm,Kamil Książek,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHIELD combines hypernetwork-based continual learning with interval arithmetic to address catastrophic forgetting and adversarial attacks simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep neural networks face issues like catastrophic forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, with no existing model solving both.

Method: SHIELD uses a hypernetwork to generate task-specific target models with interval arithmetic for robust predictions within defined ranges.

Result: SHIELD provides strict guarantees against adversarial attacks while maintaining adaptability in continual learning.

Conclusion: SHIELD successfully integrates security and adaptability, addressing a critical gap in continual learning.

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

TL;DR: HC-RLHF ensures high-confidence safety guarantees in language model alignment without sacrificing helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat safety as a tradeoff with helpfulness, risking unacceptable responses in sensitive domains.

Method: HC-RLHF decouples human preferences into helpfulness (reward model) and safety (cost model), optimizes under pessimistic constraints, and verifies safety via testing.

Result: HC-RLHF improves harmlessness and helpfulness, producing safe models with high probability.

Conclusion: HC-RLHF reliably aligns language models with human preferences while ensuring safety.

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

TL;DR: LIES introduces a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable activations for symbolic regression, outperforming baselines with sparse, accurate formulae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SR methods lack scalability and symbolic consistency, prompting the need for a more interpretable and efficient approach.

Method: LIES uses a neural network with primitive activations (logarithm, identity, exponential, sine), trained with oversampling and a tailored loss for sparsity and stability, followed by pruning.

Result: LIES consistently produces sparse, accurate symbolic formulae, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The LIES framework effectively addresses scalability and consistency in SR, with each design component validated as crucial.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design and NAS are inefficient; this work aims to unify architecture and weight optimization for better neural networks.

Method: Trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder to embed networks into a continuous space, then optimizes via gradient descent with sparsity penalties.

Result: Effectively discovers sparse, compact networks with strong performance on synthetic tasks.

Conclusion: Simultaneous optimization of architecture and weights is feasible and effective, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a
neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes
architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a
fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the
architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a
universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric
information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural
networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly
initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to
obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and
weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness
penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression
tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact
neural networks with strong performance.

### [249] [Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning of Node-Wise Battery Dynamics in Smart Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08272)
*Tarushri N. S.*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A UDE-based approach combines neural networks with physical battery ODEs to model node-specific battery dynamics in smart grids, outperforming traditional methods in generalization and capturing unmodeled effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling battery dynamics in smart grids is challenging due to stochastic solar input and variable household loads, with traditional methods lacking generalization and missing residual dynamics.

Method: Proposes embedding a neural residual into a physical battery ODE to learn node-specific battery evolution, using synthetic solar and load data for training.

Result: The UDE closely matches ground truth trajectories, shows smooth convergence, and remains stable in long-term forecasts.

Conclusion: UDE-based SciML is viable for battery modeling in decentralized energy networks, with potential for real-time control and optimization in smart grids.

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with
physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for
scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable,
and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems,
modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the
stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles.
Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture
unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn
node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a
physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and
load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural
component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from
heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth
battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains
stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of
UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy
networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and
optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive studies on feature scaling's impact on ML performance and computational costs.

Method: Evaluated 12 scaling techniques on 14 ML algorithms and 16 datasets, analyzing predictive performance and computational costs.

Result: Ensemble methods are robust to scaling, while models like Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show significant scaling-dependent performance variations.

Conclusion: Provides model-specific guidance for optimal feature scaling selection, with full transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature
scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several
less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms
and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously
analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy,
MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time,
and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as
Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM)
demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely
used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show
significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This
extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and
model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and
reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the
need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECON introduces a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm for multi-LLM coordination, achieving better performance and scalability with a proven tighter regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational costs and lack of convergence guarantees in multi-agent LLM frameworks.

Method: Recasts multi-LLM coordination as an incomplete-information game, seeking Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) with distributed reasoning and centralized output.

Result: Outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: ECON offers a scalable, efficient solution for multi-LLM coordination, with potential for larger ensembles.

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

*Zhanke Zhou,Xiao Feng,Zhaocheng Zhu,Jiangchao Yao,Sanmi Koyejo,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AR-Bench is a new benchmark evaluating LLMs' active reasoning skills, revealing their struggles compared to passive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on passive reasoning, neglecting active reasoning where LLMs interact with external systems to gather missing information.

Method: AR-Bench includes three task families (detective cases, situation puzzles, guessing numbers) to simulate real-world scenarios and test commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning.

Result: Current LLMs perform poorly in active reasoning, failing to acquire or use necessary information, with minimal improvement from advanced strategies.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for better methodologies, like interactive learning and real-time feedback, to enhance active reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a unified model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks, especially addressing the gap in handling heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs).

Method: H$^2$GFM projects meta-relations into a unified textual space, uses context encoding for semantic relationships, and employs a context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT) with a mixture of experts for structural heterogeneity.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show H$^2$GFM's effectiveness across various TAGs and learning scenarios.

Conclusion: H$^2$GFM successfully generalizes GFMs to both HoTAGs and HeTAGs, enhancing their capabilities and applications.

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains
have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across
different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing
research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the
heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on
homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple
types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and
applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to
generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse
meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a
context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To
achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph
transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context
neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT
experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types.
Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as
learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces L-STEP, a learnable spatial-temporal positional encoding method for graph deep learning, addressing limitations of current positional encoding techniques. It demonstrates superior performance in temporal link prediction across multiple datasets and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current positional encoding methods in graph deep learning are limited by pre-defined functions, lack of adaptability to evolving graphs, and inefficiency with large-scale data.

Method: Proposes L-STEP, a learnable positional encoding scheme, validated through theoretical analysis, MLP-based implementation, and empirical testing on 13 datasets.

Result: L-STEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in temporal link prediction, achieves efficiency gains, and performs well in large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: L-STEP effectively addresses limitations of existing positional encoding methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for graph deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.
Also, \name\ obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB
benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation
that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the
practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.

*Alan N. Amin,Nate Gruver,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masking diffusion outperforms other discrete diffusion models by leveraging the known distribution of jump times in discrete Markov processes. The proposed SCUD framework generalizes this idea, improving performance across various data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why masking diffusion performs better than other discrete diffusion models and to generalize this advantage to other models.

Method: Introduces schedule-conditioned discrete diffusion (SCUD), which incorporates the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model.

Result: SCUD models outperform masking diffusion when applied to images, text, and protein data.

Conclusion: Baking in the known distribution of jump times enhances discrete diffusion models, with SCUD providing a generalized framework for improved performance.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate
high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a
Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual
benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising
Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,
however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,
surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we
explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes
use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov
processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed
rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in
the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show
that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any
discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete
diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking
diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate
inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that
outperform masking.

Motivation: To systematically explore the advancements in graph prompting as a method for adapting pre-trained graph learning models to downstream tasks.

Method: Review of graph pre-training methods and prompting techniques, focusing on how prompts are designed and applied.

Result: Summarizes key techniques and applications of graph prompting, highlighting its effectiveness in various domains.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and suggests future directions for improving graph prompting in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses of diffusion models' discretization error rely on complex probabilistic tools, necessitating a simpler theoretical framework.

Method: Leverages Grönwall's inequality to analyze VP-SDEs in DDPMs, replacing Gaussian noise with discrete random variables.

Result: Convergence rate of O(1/T^(1/2)) under Lipschitz assumptions; discrete noise performs comparably to Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: Bridges theoretical rigor with practical efficiency, enabling simpler analysis and efficient sampling in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However,
existing analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex
probabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical
framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of
variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion
process. Our approach leverages Gr\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence
rate of $ \mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly
streamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise
in the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g.,
Rademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an
insight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments
validate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2)
discrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3)
incorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis
and discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with
practical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework where policy parameters are optimized autonomously, bypassing traditional control and reinforcement learning methods. It simplifies algorithms while maintaining equivalence to policy gradients and other methods, extending applicability to various domains like behavioral cloning and generative AI tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and generalize policy optimization by treating it as an autonomous system, avoiding the complexity of traditional control and reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: The method involves optimizing policy parameters directly at the autonomous system level, deriving algorithms equivalent to policy gradients, natural gradients, and proximal methods. It also extends to policy iteration and off-policy learning.

Result: The results show that the framework computes the same quantities as traditional methods but simplifies the process, making it applicable to diverse areas like behavioral cloning, system identification, and generative AI tuning.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unified and simpler approach to policy optimization, applicable beyond reinforcement learning, with potential for broader use in AI and control systems.

Abstract: We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a
(parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the
policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to
optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions,
and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and
Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous
system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy
gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to
approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since
policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same
algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system
identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is
not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to
Reinforcement Learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for relational learning with formal entity-level differential privacy guarantees, addressing challenges in sensitivity and coupled sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting privacy in relational and network-structured data is critical, but applying DP-SGD directly is challenging due to high sensitivity and coupled sampling.

Method: Proposes a rigorous sensitivity analysis, adaptive gradient clipping based on entity frequency, and extends privacy amplification to coupled sampling.

Result: Develops a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data, showing strong utility-privacy trade-offs in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled solution for private relational learning with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental
results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image

it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency (first-order methods) and generalization (second-order methods) in optimization.

Method: Uses an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation covariance matrix for preconditioning, reducing time and memory costs.

Result: Achieves improved test accuracy over first and second-order methods with lower computational resources.

Conclusion: NysAct offers a practical solution for efficient and effective optimization, bridging the gap between first and second-order methods.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods are computationally efficient and converge quickly,
but they often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, second-order
methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high
computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable
first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between
state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct
leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation
covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly
reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our
experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared
to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less
computational resources than existing second-order methods. Code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeSAE, a debiasing method for AlphaFold DB structures to improve their utility in deep learning tasks like inverse folding by addressing systematic geometric biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold DB structures, while accurate, exhibit geometric biases that limit their effectiveness in training deep models for tasks requiring fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse folding.

Method: The authors propose DeSAE, a Structure AutoEncoder trained to reconstruct native-like conformations from corrupted backbone geometries, capturing a more natural structural manifold.

Result: Debiased structures from DeSAE significantly enhance inverse folding performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work underscores the importance of addressing biases in predicted structures and provides a framework to improve structure-based learning tasks.

Abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled
structural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable
resource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training
deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse
folding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural
feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical
regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the
conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,
PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential
for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we
introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct
native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By
training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly
captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying
DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly
improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work
highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted
structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse
folding.

boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT networks necessitates real-time malicious traffic detection to enhance cybersecurity.

Method: The study employs machine learning techniques on the IoT-23 dataset, using resampling strategies to handle class imbalance and compares traditional and ensemble methods.

Result: Ensemble methods, especially gcForest, combined with imbalance treatment, show superior detection performance.

### [266] [Reinforcement Learning Teachers of Test Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08388)
*Edoardo Cetin,Tianyu Zhao,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework, Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs), avoids RL's exploration challenges by focusing on effective downstream distillation for reasoning language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of RL for reasoning LMs, especially exploration and deployment inefficiencies, by creating teachers for distillation.

Method: RLTs are trained with dense rewards by prompting them with questions and solutions to generate detailed explanations for students, tested via student understanding.

Result: 7B RLTs outperform larger LMs in distillation and cold-starting pipelines, maintaining effectiveness for larger students and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: RLTs enhance efficiency and re-usability in RL reasoning frameworks, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

*Vamshika Sutar,Amandeep Singh,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning, ensemble learning, and data augmentation to detect cyclone rapid intensification, addressing class imbalance and spatiotemporal challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid intensification in cyclones is rare and extreme, causing class imbalance and complicating detection with conventional methods.

Method: Uses deep learning for synthetic data generation and classification within a data augmentation framework, focusing on wind intensity and spatial coordinates.

Result: Data augmentation improves detection, with spatial coordinates being critical input features.

Conclusion: The framework advances synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal extreme events like cyclone rapid intensification.

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

*Fred Xu,Song Jiang,Zijie Huang,Xiao Luo,Shichang Zhang,Adrian Chen,Yizhou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE), a method for set representation learning that approximates fuzzy sets, ensuring closure under set operations and efficiency. It shows significant improvements in taxonomy expansion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set representation methods (e.g., vectors or boxes) lack closure under set operations and struggle with uncertainty. Fuzzy sets, which model uncertainty, are underutilized in embedding frameworks.

Method: Proposes FUSE, a volume approximation-based fuzzy set embedding framework. It ensures closure under set operations, preserves information, and is efficient with minimal neural architecture.

Result: FUSE achieves up to 23% improvement in taxonomy expansion tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FUSE is the first efficient fuzzy set embedding method, demonstrating strong performance in taxonomy expansion while preserving set operation properties.

Abstract: Taxonomy Expansion, which models complex concepts and their relations, can be
formulated as a set representation learning task. The generalization of set,
fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a
semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works
usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not
closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient
formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as
a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE),
satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy
set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on
minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on
the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up
to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to
understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), a hybrid ML and unsupervised method for diagnosing three-phase engines, improving accuracy by synthesizing realistic faults in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signature analysis for engine diagnostics can be enhanced with ML, but lacks realistic anomaly generation. The study aims to bridge this gap by integrating ML with engine physics.

Method: Proposes SGDA, an unsupervised framework combining ML with signature analysis to synthesize physically plausible faults in healthy current signals.

Result: Achieves superior diagnostic accuracy and reliability, offering a robust solution for industrial applications.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach significantly advances engine diagnostics, providing an efficient and realistic method for fault detection.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent
diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance
diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on
signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from
the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by
combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation
methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose
Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that
synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of
healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA
creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally
intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both
supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior
diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The
findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to
the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

### [270] [Improved Scaling Laws in Linear Regression via Data Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08415)
*Licong Lin,Jingfeng Wu,Peter L. Bartlett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data reuse improves scaling laws in linear regression, showing better test error bounds with multi-pass SGD compared to one-pass SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unsustainability of neural scaling laws when new data is exhausted by exploring data reuse.

Method: Derive test error bounds for multi-pass SGD on linear models with sketched features, assuming power-law spectra for data covariance and true parameters.

Result: Multi-pass SGD achieves better test error scaling (Θ(M^{1−b} + L^{(1−b)/a})) than one-pass SGD (Θ(M^{1−b} + N^{(1−b)/a})).

Conclusion: Data reuse (L>N) enhances scaling laws in data-constrained scenarios, validated by simulations.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models
trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase.
However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In
this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear
regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional
linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass
SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has
a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior
with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show
that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,
where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,
one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see
e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse
(i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are
also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

### [271] [Offline RL with Smooth OOD Generalization in Convex Hull and its Neighborhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08417)
*Qingmao Yao,Zhichao Lei,Tianyuan Chen,Ziyue Yuan,Xuefan Chen,Jianxiang Liu,Faguo Wu,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SQOG, a method to improve Q-value estimation in offline RL by addressing over-constraint issues in OOD regions using the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from Q-value overestimation for OOD actions due to distributional shifts, and existing methods are overly conservative, limiting Q-function generalization.

Method: Proposes SBO to smooth OOD Q-values with neighboring in-sample values within the Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). The SQOG algorithm implements this approach.

Result: SQOG achieves near-accurate Q-value estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on D4RL benchmarks in performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: SQOG effectively addresses the over-constraint issue, improving Q-function generalization and policy performance in offline RL.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: GALA dynamically adjusts learning rates by tracking gradient alignment and local curvature, eliminating the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning learning rates for large-scale deep learning models is time-consuming and requires extensive grid searches.

Method: GALA adjusts learning rates dynamically using gradient alignment and local curvature, formulated as a one-dimensional online learning problem.

Result: GALA achieves robust performance across various initial learning rates and performs competitively without tuning.

Conclusion: GALA provides a flexible, adaptive learning rate framework that reduces the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: The performance of an optimizer on large-scale deep learning models depends
critically on fine-tuning the learning rate, often requiring an extensive grid
search over base learning rates, schedules, and other hyperparameters. In this
paper, we propose a principled framework called GALA (Gradient Alignment-based
Learning rate Adaptation), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by
tracking the alignment between consecutive gradients and using a local
curvature estimate. Guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the
problem of selecting the learning rate as a one-dimensional online learning
problem. When paired with an online learning algorithm such as
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, our method produces a flexible, adaptive
learning rate schedule that tends to increase when consecutive gradients are
aligned and decrease otherwise. We establish a data-adaptive convergence rate
for normalized SGD equipped with GALA in the smooth, nonconvex setting.
Empirically, common optimizers such as SGD and Adam, when augmented with GALA,
demonstrate robust performance across a wide range of initial learning rates
and perform competitively without the need for tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HASFL is a heterogeneity-aware split federated learning framework that adaptively controls batch sizes and model splitting to mitigate the straggler effect in edge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split federated learning approaches struggle with the straggler effect due to heterogeneous edge device capabilities.

Method: HASFL adaptively adjusts batch sizes and model splitting based on a derived convergence bound to balance latency and training performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show HASFL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in heterogeneous edge networks.

Conclusion: HASFL effectively addresses resource heterogeneity in split federated learning, improving training convergence and performance.

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

*Mingyuan Fan,Fuyi Wang,Cen Chen,Jianying Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that gradient leakage attacks (GLAs) can reconstruct raw data in realistic federated learning (FL) environments, introducing FedLeak to address performance bottlenecks and highlighting FL's privacy vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The debate around FL's privacy safeguards is unresolved, with GLAs either deemed effective or limited. This paper aims to empirically show GLAs' real-world threat.

Method: The authors revisit GLAs, identify their gradient matching problem, and develop FedLeak with partial gradient matching and gradient regularization techniques. A practical evaluation protocol is also introduced.

Result: FedLeak achieves high-fidelity data reconstruction in realistic FL settings, revealing significant privacy risks.

Conclusion: The study underscores FL's vulnerability to GLAs and calls for stronger defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple
clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy,
at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model,
where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing
private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is
non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically
misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal,
observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to
learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We
develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging
setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying
mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an
innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a
matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a
pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore
efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a
near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's
optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our
results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for
a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic
agents.

TL;DR: TAWM improves model performance by incorporating temporal dynamics and diverse time-step sizes, outperforming conventional models in control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of fixed time-step sampling in conventional models, which may miss high- or low-frequency dynamics.

Method: TAWM conditions on time-step size (Δt) and trains over diverse Δt values, leveraging information-theoretic insights for optimal sampling.

Result: TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in control tasks, with the same training samples and iterations.

Conclusion: TAWM's time-aware formulation enhances performance and data efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse control problems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBODY is a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that leverages learned dynamics and representation learning to explore target domains beyond offline datasets, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-dynamics offline RL methods are limited by target domain transitions, restricting policy exploration. MOBODY aims to overcome this by generating synthetic transitions and learning shared latent representations.

Method: MOBODY uses model rollouts for synthetic transitions, representation learning for shared dynamics, and a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss for policy regularization.

Result: MOBODY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MuJoCo benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: MOBODY effectively addresses the limitations of off-dynamics offline RL by enabling target domain exploration and leveraging cross-domain data.

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforced RCSL improves RCSL by introducing in-distribution optimal return-to-go, enhancing performance without complex techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCSL lacks the stitching property, limiting performance based on dataset quality. Reinforced RCSL addresses this to improve decision-making.

Method: Proposes Reinforced RCSL, using in-distribution optimal return-to-go to identify achievable future returns, avoiding complex augmentation.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show Reinforced RCSL outperforms standard RCSL across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL offers a simple, effective solution to RCSL's limitations, improving offline sequential decision-making.

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAC, a computationally efficient second-order optimization method for neural networks, improving upon KFAC by approximating Kronecker factors in the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and integrating attention scores for transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order methods like KFAC offer better convergence but are computationally expensive. The paper aims to reduce this burden while maintaining performance.

Method: Analyzes Kronecker factors in KFAC's FIM, proposes efficient approximations, and integrates attention scores for transformers, resulting in the MAC method.

Result: MAC outperforms KFAC and other methods in accuracy, training time, and memory usage, with proven convergence under certain conditions.

Conclusion: MAC is a scalable and efficient second-order optimizer, particularly effective for transformers, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC,
exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss
landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In
this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher
information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to
activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on
their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in
a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our
knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to
the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate
attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence
property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under
which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various
network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end
training time, and memory usage. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning) is a method to enhance LLM safety during fine-tuning by using alignment direction as an anchor to suppress harmful updates, outperforming Safe LoRA in reducing harmful behavior and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to safety risks during fine-tuning, where small malicious or harmless data can compromise safeguards. The paper aims to address this by leveraging alignment direction insights.

Method: Proposes AsFT, integrating a regularization term into the training objective to anchor updates along the alignment direction, suppressing harmful perturbations.

Result: AsFT reduces harmful behavior by 7.60%, improves model performance by 3.44%, and maintains robustness across settings.

Conclusion: AsFT effectively confines fine-tuning within a narrow safety basin, enhancing LLM safety and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during
fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise
safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction --
defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we
observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In
contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are
strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety
and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this
insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring
Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the

*Xiaolong He,Yeonjong Shin,Anthony Gruber,Sohyeon Jung,Kookjin Lee,Youngsoo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces tLaSDI, a thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics framework for reduced-order modeling, combining autoencoders and pGFINNs to preserve thermodynamic principles while achieving high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient reduced-order modeling framework for parametric nonlinear dynamical systems that preserves thermodynamic principles like free energy conservation and entropy generation.

Method: Integrates autoencoders for dimensionality reduction with pGFINNs for learning parametric latent dynamics. Uses physics-informed active learning for adaptive data sampling.

Result: Achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, reduces training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) costs, and reveals thermodynamic behavior in latent dynamics.

Conclusion: tLaSDI is highly efficient and accurate, providing insights into thermodynamic behavior while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics
identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric
nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for
dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC
formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning
of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles
such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter
space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning
strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator
to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling
at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers'
equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and
significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost.
Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic
behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space
dynamics.

*Shahaf Bassan,Yizhak Yisrael Elboher,Tobias Ladner,Matthias Althoff,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an abstraction-refinement technique to efficiently compute provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions, addressing scalability issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc explainability methods lack formal guarantees and face scalability challenges when computing explanations with provable sufficiency.

Method: The authors introduce an abstraction-refinement approach, constructing a reduced neural network to speed up verification. If insufficient, the network is iteratively refined until convergence.

Result: Experiments show the method improves efficiency in obtaining provably sufficient explanations and offers fine-grained interpretations across abstraction levels.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively balances efficiency and provable guarantees for neural network explanations.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

*Jacob Piland,Chris Sweet,Adam Czakja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHAMs for adversarial testing of CAM robustness and proposes DiffGradCAM, a contrastive method resistant to passive fooling, improving saliency-based explanation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CAM methods are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation (e.g., passive fooling) due to their focus on individual logits, not logit differences.

Method: Proposes SHAMs for adversarial benchmarking and DiffGradCAM, a lightweight, contrastive CAM method resistant to passive fooling.

Result: Validates SHAMs and DiffGradCAM across multi-class tasks, showing robustness in adversarial and non-adversarial cases.

Conclusion: SHAM and DiffGradCAM provide a framework for enhancing the robustness of saliency-based explanations in CNNs.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g.,
GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual
logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership
probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between
logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs
vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model
is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance.
We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an
\emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM
robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling
vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and
contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to
passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as
GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a
new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based
explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few
and many classes.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is
reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate
demanding simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet,
persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency
hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address
these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the

fidelity, computational efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization.
This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting
several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation
score. Notably, the top entry exceeded the performance of the original OpenFOAM
solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to
outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these
results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the
robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future
scientific ML challenges.

*Pedro Jiménez-González,Miguel C. Soriano,Lucas Lacasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how large learning rates in gradient descent (GD) can shift neural network training from exploitation to an exploration-exploitation balance, characterized by chaotic dynamics, and shows this regime accelerates training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics of neural network training with unconventional learning rates and understand the role of chaotic behavior in optimizing performance.

Method: Analyzes GD dynamics for large learning rates, measuring the network's Lyapunov exponent to characterize chaos, and evaluates training time and accuracy on tasks like MNIST.

Result: For certain learning rates, GD exhibits chaotic dynamics, balancing exploration and exploitation, and achieves minimal training time while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Transient chaotic dynamics in GD can optimize neural network training, suggesting locating the onset of chaos accelerates learning across various tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted
with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational
dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the
neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning
rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD
optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime
of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of
learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions --
as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --.
Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable
accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate
region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial
neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially
illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range
of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters,
and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in
the training of artificial neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepForm is a specialized LLM for automated communication system formulation, trained on a curated dataset (CSFRC) and a two-stage strategy (SFT + C-ReMax RL), outperforming larger LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and reasoning for communication system formulation, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: Two-stage training: SFT with CoT data for domain knowledge, followed by rule-based RL (C-ReMax) for advanced reasoning.

Result: DeepForm achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing larger proprietary LLMs in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: DeepForm bridges the gap in specialized LLMs for communication systems, with resources to be released for further research.

Abstract: Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future
wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose
models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning
capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data
required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication
system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first
reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We
propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated
for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus
(CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge;
second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based
on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated
reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly
outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release

*Waiss Azizian,Michael Kirchhof,Eugene Ndiaye,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,Pierre Ablin,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a limitation in using linear classifiers to assess LLM reliability, showing task-dependent 'geometries of truth' that fail to transfer across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about LLM reliability by examining the transferability of activation-based truth assessments across tasks.

Method: Analyzed linear classifiers trained on LLM activations, comparing their performance and support across distinct tasks, and tested more sophisticated approaches like mixtures of probes.

Result: Linear classifiers trained on different tasks share little similarity and have almost disjoint supports, with advanced methods failing to overcome this limitation.

Conclusion: The 'geometry of truth' in LLMs is task-dependent, limiting the generalization of activation-based reliability assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLEEPYLAND is an open-source framework for sleep staging evaluation, addressing challenges like model bias and dataset variability. It includes extensive datasets and introduces SOMNUS, an ensemble model outperforming SoA methods and even human scorers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of deep learning for sleep staging is limited by evaluation challenges, generalization issues, and human annotation variability.

Method: The framework includes large ID and OOD datasets, pre-trained models, and SOMNUS, an ensemble model combining architectures via soft voting.

Result: SOMNUS achieves robust performance (macro-F1 68.7%-87.2%), outperforms SoA methods, and exceeds human scorers in consensus. It also identifies model biases.

Conclusion: SLEEPYLAND and SOMNUS improve sleep staging evaluation, but no model consistently minimizes bias, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical
adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation,
generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human
annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation
framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 22'0000
hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain
(OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders,
and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA
architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single-
and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble
combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting.
SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with
macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in
94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including
cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data
as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked
to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness,
no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical
markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H,
DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on
DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus
than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA
cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and
inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with
ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

TL;DR: PBFM embeds physical constraints into generative models, improving accuracy and efficiency in physics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods learn physics implicitly; PBFM explicitly incorporates physical constraints for better accuracy.

Method: PBFM combines flow matching loss with physics-based residual loss, uses temporal unrolling, and analyzes noise levels.

Result: PBFM achieves 8x better physical residuals than FM and outperforms in distributional accuracy.

Conclusion: PBFM offers a principled framework for surrogate modeling and simulation in physics and engineering.

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently selecting few-shot examples under context-length constraints is crucial for in-context learning with LLMs.

Method: Formulates exemplar selection as a top-m best arms problem, using CASE for selective exploration and a linear scoring function.

Result: Achieves 7x speedup and 87% fewer LLM calls compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CASE is a highly efficient and effective solution for exemplar selection in LLM-based tasks.

Abstract: The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot
examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing
effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we
formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification
problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of
arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE
(Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient
selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms,
which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of
the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby
reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations.
Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a
parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits
setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in
runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing
performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/kiranpurohit/CASE

Conclusion: HSG-12M advances geometry-aware graph learning and opens new opportunities for data-driven scientific discovery in physics and beyond.

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two

5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Result: TiViT achieves top performance on benchmarks, with intermediate ViT layers proving most effective. Combining TiViT and TSFM features yields further gains.

Conclusion: TiViT demonstrates a novel way to reuse vision representations for non-visual tasks, revealing strong complementarity with TSFMs.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of semi-gradient DICE, enabling reliable OPE and constrained RL.

Abstract: Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch
between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target
distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy
optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the
flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating
costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches
designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework
inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for
constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this
limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a
fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost
estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE
and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost
estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained
RL benchmark, DSRL.

*Youqi Wu,Jingwei Zhang,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RP-KrossFuse unifies cross-modal and single-modality embeddings to retain cross-modal alignment while matching modality-expert performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal embeddings underperform in modality-specific tasks, while single-modality embeddings lack cross-modal alignment. RP-KrossFuse aims to bridge this gap.

Method: RP-KrossFuse uses random projection-based Kronecker product to fuse embeddings, operating efficiently in kernel space with scalable implementations.

Result: RP-KrossFuse achieves competitive modality-specific performance while preserving cross-modal alignment, as shown in experiments with CLIP and uni-modal embeddings.

Conclusion: RP-KrossFuse successfully bridges the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings, balancing performance and alignment.

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved
promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these
embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality
embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality
embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities.
In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and
single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert
embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment.
To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random
projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with
single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise
similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a
specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier
features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical
experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text
embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves
competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal
alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

### [298] [JoFormer (Journey-based Transformer): Theory and Empirical Analysis on the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08652)
*Mahesh Godavarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JoFormer, a journey-based Transformer, improves positional information handling using learnable directional transforms, outperforming RoFormer in perplexity and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of effectively incorporating positional information in Transformers, which is crucial for sequence modeling.

Method: Introduces JoFormer, a Transformer architecture using learnable directional transforms for relative positions, derived from non-commutative algebra.

Result: JoFormer achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence than RoFormer on the Tiny Shakespeare task.

Conclusion: JoFormer provides a principled, expressive approach to integrating positional structure in Transformers, showing promise for future architectures.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

*Kamil Jerabek,Jan Luxemburk,Richard Plny,Josef Koumar,Jaroslav Pesek,Karel Hynek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study reveals that simple k-NN models match or outperform complex neural networks in network traffic classification due to dataset redundancy, challenging standard ML practices in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why simple k-NN baselines perform well in traffic classification and to address issues like dataset redundancy and overestimated performance.

Method: Evaluation of k-NN baselines across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, analyzing dataset redundancy and splitting practices.

Result: Most datasets contain over 50% redundant samples, leading to overestimated performance and conflicting labels for identical flows.

Conclusion: Standard ML practices may be ill-suited for TC; new task formulation and evaluation directions are proposed to realign the field.

Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for
over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw
a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy.
However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet
sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even
outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon
further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and
investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets
contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which
frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting
practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and
reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting
labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard
machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may
be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation
and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.

*Jinkwan Jang,Hyungjin Park,Jinmyeong Choi,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChannelTokenFormer is a Transformer-based model addressing real-world time series challenges like inter-channel dependencies, asynchronous sampling, and missing values, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models oversimplify real-world complexities like varying sampling periods and missing data, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes ChannelTokenFormer, a flexible Transformer architecture capturing cross-channel interactions, handling asynchronous sampling, and missing values.

Result: Demonstrates superior robustness and accuracy on benchmark and real-world datasets under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer effectively bridges the gap between theoretical assumptions and real-world time series forecasting needs.

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

### [301] [Optimizing Learned Image Compression on Scalar and Entropy-Constraint Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08662)
*Florian Borzechowski,Michael Schäfer,Heiko Schwarz,Jonathan Pfaff,Detlev Marpe,Thomas Wiegand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a finetuning training step for image compression with variational autoencoders to address quantization issues, improving coding gain without added inference complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for approximating quantization in training produce suboptimal networks due to incorrect noise modeling, especially for entropy-constraint quantizers.

Method: After conventional end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents from inference, particularly for entropy-constraint quantizers like Trellis-Coded Quantization.

Result: Retraining on correctly quantized data yields additional coding gain (1%-2.2% savings in Bjøntegaard-Delta bitrate) for both uniform scalar and entropy-constraint quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed finetuning step effectively improves compression efficiency without increasing inference complexity.

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework enhances small language models (SLMs) using LLM-generated blueprints and prompt template search, improving reasoning without increasing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are efficient but limited in reasoning and sensitive to prompts, needing a lightweight solution.

Method: Proposes a framework with LLM-generated blueprints for structured reasoning and prompt template search to reduce sensitivity.

Result: Improved SLM performance in math, coding, and logic tasks (GSM8K, MBPP, BBH).

Conclusion: The framework offers a lightweight, deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their
reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide
structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle
related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template
search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring
additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution
for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

### [303] [Towards Fair Representation: Clustering and Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08673)
*Diptarka Chakraborty,Kushagra Chatterjee,Debarati Das,Tien Long Nguyen,Romina Nobahari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces fair consensus clustering, ensuring proportional representation of protected groups in clusters, and provides approximation algorithms for fairness enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fairness in consensus clustering by ensuring proportional representation of protected groups, inspired by the disparate impact doctrine.

Method: Develops optimal and near-linear time approximation algorithms for enforcing fairness in clustering, including handling unequal group sizes.

Result: Provides constant-factor approximation for fair consensus clustering and proves NP-hardness for unequal-sized groups.

Conclusion: The work lays foundational results for fair clustering, with potential broader implications for other clustering problems lacking fairness guarantees.

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data
analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset,
potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single
clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this
work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as
introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the
disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each
protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a
consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect
to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing
clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many
clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal
algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time
constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with
different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation
result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups.
Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest
Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems,
particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their
fair variants.

TL;DR: IS-DAAs, an importance-sampling approach, mitigates over-optimization in Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) like DPO by clipping importance ratios, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAAs like DPO are prone to over-optimization, causing model drift and performance degradation, necessitating a solution.

Method: Proposes IS-DAAs, which multiplies the DAA objective with a clipped importance ratio to account for the reference policy distribution.

Result: IS-DAAs effectively mitigate over-optimization, especially with low regularization, and outperform alternatives.

Conclusion: IS-DAAs offer a robust solution to over-optimization in DAAs, enhancing alignment with human values.

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in
which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded
performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel
importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of
offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective
with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution.
IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance
sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate
over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve
better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our
implementations are provided publicly at this link.

TL;DR: VAE-LF, a VAE-based model, improves power load forecasting by efficiently representing and completing high-dimensional, incomplete power load monitoring data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional and incomplete power load monitoring data challenges forecasting models, necessitating an efficient data-completion solution.

Method: VAE-LF uses an encoder-decoder structure to learn low-dimensional latent representations and generate complementary data from split vectors of the input data.

Result: VAE-LF outperforms benchmarks on the UK-DALE dataset, showing lower RMSE and MAE, especially in low sparsity cases.

Conclusion: The method offers an effective solution for data completion in smart grid load management.

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in
smart grids.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the environmental impact of LLMs and introduces R-ICE, a framework for estimating prompt-level carbon emissions using SOTA benchmarks, offering a non-intrusive solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of Generative AI and LLMs poses environmental challenges, hindering sustainability goals. Current tools for energy monitoring and emission estimation are inadequate.

Method: The paper proposes R-ICE, a framework leveraging existing LLM benchmarks to estimate carbon emissions non-intrusively, addressing current tool limitations.

Result: Validation shows benchmark-based modeling is effective for emission estimation, enabling use-cases like dynamic LLM routing and carbon accounting.

Conclusion: R-ICE demonstrates the potential of benchmark-based approaches for accurate emission estimation, calling for further research.

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

*Sidhika Balachandar,Shuvom Sadhuka,Bonnie Berger,Emma Pierson,Nikhil Garg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GNN-based model combines sparse government ratings and dense but biased crowdsourced reports to predict urban incident states, validated on NYC data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of predicting urban incidents using sparse, unbiased government ratings and dense, biased crowdsourced reports.

Method: Propose a multiview, multioutput GNN model integrating both data sources, tested on real and semi-synthetic NYC data.

Result: The model outperforms single-source models, especially when ratings are sparse and reports are predictive. It also identifies demographic biases in reporting.

Conclusion: The approach effectively predicts latent incident states using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data, with broader applicability.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal
forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting,
government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like
potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street
conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection
ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of
neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via
crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to
heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a
multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and
biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we
investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect,
standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced
reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139
types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that
our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only
reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data
is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic
biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report
problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach
for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general stability theorem for deep neural networks is introduced, accommodating sparsity and non-i.i.d. weights, extending prior work on Jacobian stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior work, which focused on fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights, by analyzing spectral stability in more complex network models.

Method: Leverage advances in random matrix theory to establish a stability theorem for networks with sparsity and weakly correlated weights.

Result: Rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a broader class of network models, including pruned and trained networks.

Conclusion: Extends theoretical foundation for initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured randomness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing
gradients as depth increases, a phenomenon closely tied to the spectral
behavior of the input-output Jacobian. Prior work has identified critical
initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are
typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this
work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general
stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as
that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g.
induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix
theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much
broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for
initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent
randomness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring security for AI agents powered by LLMs is critical, especially against prompt injection attacks when handling sensitive data or tool access.

Method: A set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection, analyzed systematically.

Result: Trade-offs between utility and security are discussed, and real-world applicability is demonstrated through case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed design patterns offer a practical approach to enhancing AI agent security against prompt injection threats.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly
versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their
security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are
prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural
language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool
access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of
principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to
prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their
trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world
applicability through a series of case studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IMAGIC-500 dataset, a synthetic benchmark for evaluating missing data imputation methods in socioeconomic research, addressing limitations of data privacy and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world socioeconomic datasets are restricted by data protection, limiting reproducibility and benchmark availability for imputation methods.

Method: Utilizes the World Bank's synthetic dataset to create IMAGIC-500, evaluating imputation under various missing mechanisms and ratios.

Result: Benchmark results reveal performance differences among statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation techniques.

Conclusion: IMAGIC-500 aims to support robust imputation algorithm development and reproducible social science research.

Abstract: Missing data imputation in tabular datasets remains a pivotal challenge in
data science and machine learning, particularly within socioeconomic research.
However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data
protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic
derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of
benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly
available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks
for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets,
whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly
available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which
closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public,
enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting
point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k
individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic
features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world
household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data
imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR,
MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation
considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables,
computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as
estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results
highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine
learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent
diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate
the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social
science research.

*Amin Avan,Akramul Azim,Qusay Mahmoud*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Agile Reinforcement Learning (aRL) to improve task scheduling in edge computing by reducing learning time and enhancing predictability through informed exploration and action-masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and dynamic nature of edge computing make traditional heuristic and metaheuristic schedulers ineffective, while reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from prolonged learning times due to irrelevant action exploration.

Method: The study introduces aRL, where the RL-agent performs informed exploration and executes only relevant actions, using action-masking to enhance predictability and convergence.

Result: Experiments show aRL achieves a higher hit-ratio and faster convergence compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: aRL is a promising solution for scheduling soft real-time tasks in edge computing due to its rapid adaptation and efficiency.

Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing
significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing
environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential
growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and
highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the
complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and
metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating
optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to
adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of
edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been
incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions
inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant
limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time
required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale
problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and
frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study
proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs
informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the
predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and
convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the
tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments
demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking
methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the
baseline approaches.

### [313] [Adapting to Heterophilic Graph Data with Structure-Guided Neighbor Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08871)
*Victor M. Tenorio,Madeline Navarro,Samuel Rey,Santiago Segarra,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-GNN improves GNN performance on heterophilic data by creating alternative graph structures with higher label homophily and adaptively combining them with the original graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with heterophilic data due to their reliance on homophily assumptions. This work aims to enhance GNN performance by leveraging structural attributes to create more homophilic graphs.

Method: Proposes SG-GNN, which constructs alternative graphs with higher label homophily by linking nodes with similar structural attributes. It processes these alongside the original graph, learning adaptive weights for their contributions.

Result: SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on heterophilic benchmark datasets, demonstrating the benefits of structural guidance.

Conclusion: Exploiting structural information to guide GNNs is effective, especially for heterophilic data, as shown by SG-GNN's superior performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where
connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily
and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating
alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural
attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label
homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can
be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections
between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views
increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on
these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture
that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural
graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic
characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or
highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting
structural information to guide GNNs.

TL;DR: InfoDPCCA is a dynamic probabilistic CCA framework for extracting shared and sequence-specific latent representations from interdependent data streams, using an information-theoretic objective for improved interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential data in machine learning, with applications in natural science and engineering.

Method: InfoDPCCA uses a novel information-theoretic objective, a two-step training scheme, and residual connections to balance representation compression and predictive sufficiency while learning shared and sequence-specific latent components.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data show InfoDPCCA excels in representation learning.

Conclusion: InfoDPCCA provides a robust and interpretable framework for dynamic CCA, outperforming prior models like DPCCA, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning
natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic
probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model
two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel
information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that
captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances
representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning
separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence.
Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between
the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce
a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic
representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual
connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on
synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool
for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at

TL;DR: SeerAttention-R is a sparse attention framework for long decoding in reasoning models, retaining self-distilled gating for sparsity while removing query pooling. It achieves near-lossless accuracy with 4K tokens and 9x speedup over FlashAttention-3.


<details>

Result: Near-lossless reasoning accuracy with 4K tokens and 9x speedup on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity.

Conclusion: SeerAttention-R is a flexible, efficient solution for long decoding in reasoning models, with significant performance gains.

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically
tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from
SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention
sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query
pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in
gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing
pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that
SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention
block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse

### [317] [SwS: Self-aware Weakness-driven Problem Synthesis in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08989)
*Xiao Liang,Zhong-Zhi Li,Yeyun Gong,Yang Wang,Hengyuan Zhang,Yelong Shen,Ying Nian Wu,Weizhu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwS, a framework for self-aware weakness-driven problem synthesis in RLVR to improve LLM performance on reasoning tasks by targeting model deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing problem sets for RLVR lack quality and scalability, and synthetic datasets often ignore model capabilities, limiting effectiveness.

Method: SwS identifies model weaknesses (consistent failures in RL training), extracts core concepts, and synthesizes new problems to address these weaknesses.

Result: SwS achieves average performance gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SwS enables robust generalization by self-identifying and addressing model weaknesses without external knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

### [318] [Intention-Conditioned Flow Occupancy Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08902)
*Chongyi Zheng,Seohong Park,Sergey Levine,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InFOM, a method for pre-training large RL models using flow matching and latent user intentions, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RL challenges like sample efficiency and robustness by leveraging large-scale pre-training, inspired by generative AI advances.

Method: Proposes intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM) to predict distant future states using flow matching and latent user intentions.

Result: Achieves 1.8× median improvement in returns and 36% higher success rates on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: InFOM effectively enables large-scale RL pre-training, improving adaptation and performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

### [319] [e3: Learning to Explore Enables Extrapolation of Test-Time Compute for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09026)
*Amrith Setlur,Matthew Y. R. Yang,Charlie Snell,Jeremy Greer,Ian Wu,Virginia Smith,Max Simchowitz,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (e3) to improve LLM reasoning by enabling in-context exploration, allowing models to extrapolate beyond their training token budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning models fail to extrapolate well, limiting their performance on harder problems with longer inference times.

Method: The e3 method involves training LLMs to chain operations (e.g., generation, verification) and use negative gradients for exploration, coupled with a curriculum-based training approach.

Result: The e3-1.7B model achieves top scores on benchmarks (AIME'25, HMMT'25) and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget, improving both pass@1 and pass@k scores.

Conclusion: In-context exploration (e3) effectively enhances LLM reasoning and extrapolation, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extended equation learning (EQL) to Multi-experiment EQL (ME-EQL) with two methods (OAT and ES) to improve generalizability and reduce error in modeling biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABM is computationally intensive and lacks analytical tractability; EQL methods require extensive simulations, limiting generalizability.

Method: Introduced OAT ME-EQL (individual models per parameter set with interpolation) and ES ME-EQL (unified model library across parameters). Tested on birth-death and migration ABM models.

Result: Both methods reduced relative error in parameter recovery; OAT ME-EQL showed better generalizability.

Conclusion: ME-EQL enhances generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex biological systems.

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In
this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by
introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns
individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,
and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library
across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field
model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with
spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the
relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT
ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings
highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to
enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex
biological systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LMDI+ extends MDI+ to local feature importance, outperforming LIME and TreeSHAP in accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability in high-stakes domains requires trustworthy local feature importance methods, but existing approaches like LIME and TreeSHAP rely on approximations and unstable perturbations.

Method: LMDI+ extends the global MDI+ framework to the local (sample-specific) setting by leveraging the equivalence between decision trees and linear models.

Result: LMDI+ improves downstream task performance by 10% over baselines and shows greater stability in feature importance rankings.

Conclusion: LMDI+ enables better local interpretability, including counterfactual identification and subgroup discovery, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data
over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational
efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in
high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring
trustworthy predictions. This has motivated the development of popular local
(i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and
TreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the
model's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable
perturbations. These issues are addressed in the global setting by MDI+, a
feature importance method which exploits an equivalence between decision trees
and linear models on a transformed node basis. However, the global MDI+ scores
are not able to explain predictions when faced with heterogeneous individual
characteristics. To address this gap, we propose Local MDI+ (LMDI+), a novel
extension of the MDI+ framework to the sample specific setting. LMDI+
outperforms existing baselines LIME and TreeSHAP in identifying
instance-specific signal features, averaging a 10% improvement in downstream
task performance across twelve real-world benchmark datasets. It further
demonstrates greater stability by consistently producing similar instance-level
feature importance rankings across multiple random forest fits. Finally, LMDI+
enables local interpretability use cases, including the identification of
closer counterfactuals and the discovery of homogeneous subgroups.

TL;DR: BioLangFusion integrates DNA, mRNA, and protein language models into unified representations using codon-level alignment and three fusion techniques, outperforming unimodal baselines in molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The central dogma of molecular biology (gene to transcript to protein) inspires the need for unified molecular representations.

Method: Aligns embeddings at the codon level and employs three fusion techniques: concatenation, entropy-regularized attention pooling, and cross-modal multi-head attention.

Result: Outperforms unimodal baselines in five molecular property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Simple fusion of pre-trained models captures complementary multi-omic information efficiently.

Abstract: We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA,
mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations.
Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene
to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically
meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure
direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion
techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized
attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal
multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for
combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional
pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward
integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five
molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal
baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture
complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: KARMA introduces adaptive decomposition and hybrid frequency-time modules for efficient multivariate time series forecasting, outperforming traditional and Transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decomposition methods and Transformer-based models struggle with dynamic time series characteristics and computational complexity.

Method: KARMA uses Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition (ATCD) and Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition (HFTD) with Mamba-based KarmaBlock for multi-scale processing.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in accuracy and efficiency across eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: KARMA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering superior performance for complex time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key
requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex
interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition
modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on
fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the
series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the
other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle
to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to
their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to
dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a
Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series
into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with
multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local
information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets
from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms
mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency. Code and full results are available at this repository:

TL;DR: The paper addresses environmental state perturbations in DRL, proposing a non-targeted attack method and a defense framework (BAT) to enhance agent robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL robustness studies overlook environmental state perturbations, which are common in embodied scenarios.

Method: Introduces a non-targeted attack for calibration, then proposes BAT: supervised learning tuning followed by adversarial RL training.

Result: Mainstream agents are vulnerable to environmental perturbations; BAT significantly improves robustness.

Conclusion: BAT outperforms existing robust RL methods, proving effective against environmental state perturbations.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing efficiency and scalability of RLHF by addressing inefficiencies in sample pairing and limited data diversity in traditional methods like DPO.

Method: Introduces preference refinement with CoT sampling, perplexity-based scoring, and M-DPO to capture fine-grained preference differences.

Result: Significantly improves data efficiency and model performance, matching large-scale dataset results in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of data-efficient strategies for reward model optimization, benefiting low-resource RLHF applications.

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover connections between time series characteristics and model performance, addressing the lack of understanding in how specific data traits align with model strengths.

Method: Developed TimeFlex, a modular architecture for diverse temporal dynamics, and a Gaussian Process-generated dataset with known characteristics for targeted evaluation.

Result: TimeFlex is compared to state-of-the-art models, providing insights into model performance under varied time series conditions.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of model adaptability to specific time series traits, with TimeFlex demonstrating promising flexibility.

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates neural networks' ability to generalize symbolic rules, focusing on Transformers, GCNs, and LSTMs in a propositional logic task. While models perform well in-distribution, generalization to unseen patterns, especially negation, remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural networks' capacity for symbolic rule acquisition and their limitations in reasoning tasks, particularly in a controlled, interpretable setting.

Method: Evaluated three architectures (Transformers, GCNs, LSTMs) on a propositional logic task requiring satisfying assignments for formulas. Introduced a balanced dataset to test generalization.

Result: Models performed well in-distribution but struggled with unseen patterns, especially negation. Transformers failed without structural biases.

Conclusion: Standard architectures lack systematic representation of logical operators, indicating a need for stronger inductive biases for robust rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of finetuning strategies on diverse datasets, analyzing changes in TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms.

Result: Full finetuning is most effective, improving performance on datasets up to 50K objects. Achieves state-of-the-art on I.I.D. splits but less stable on temporal shifts.

Conclusion: Finetuning enhances TabPFNv2's performance by refining similarity measures, though stability varies with dataset characteristics.

Abstract: Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep
learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over
traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context
learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets.
However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational
models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains
underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational
models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate
fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically
evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings
establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms
of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters
TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.
We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after
gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of
test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more
accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows
finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately
weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction
logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on
datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost
all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning
allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with
gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and
prior methods remain better.

### [329] [Branched Schrödinger Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09007)
*Sophia Tang,Yinuo Zhang,Alexander Tong,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BranchSBM introduces a framework for learning branched Schrödinger bridges, enabling multi-path transitions between distributions, unlike unimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like flow matching and Schrödinger Bridge Matching are limited to unimodal transitions, failing to capture branched or divergent evolution.

Method: BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and growth processes to model population-level divergence into multiple terminal distributions.

Result: BranchSBM is more expressive and essential for tasks like multi-path navigation, cell fate bifurcation modeling, and simulating diverging cellular responses.

Conclusion: BranchSBM addresses the limitation of unimodal transitions, offering a versatile solution for complex generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

*Sebastian Schmidt,Prasanga Dhungel,Christoffer Löffler,Björn Nieth,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework predicts sample importance for data pruning using minimal training data, improving efficiency without full initial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training advanced models is computationally expensive due to large datasets. Existing pruning methods require full training, negating efficiency gains.

Method: Introduces an importance score extrapolation framework using k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks to predict sample importance from a small subset.

Result: Effective for 2 pruning methods, 4 datasets, and 3 training paradigms, showing promise for scaling expensive tasks like pruning and data attribution.

Conclusion: Score extrapolation is a scalable solution for reducing computational costs in data pruning and related tasks.

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning
techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving
model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a
full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any
efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires
training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in
this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately
predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from
this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2
state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training
paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate
that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score
calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

TL;DR: SPEED is an adaptive RL curriculum for training large language models, selectively choosing intermediate-difficulty prompts to enhance efficiency, achieving 2x-6x faster training without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models with RL is computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling.

Method: Introduces SPEED, an adaptive online RL curriculum that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts to optimize learning efficiency.

Result: Empirically, SPEED achieves 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy and requires no manual tuning.

Conclusion: SPEED efficiently accelerates RL training for language models by focusing on intermediate-difficulty prompts, integrating seamlessly with standard RL algorithms.

Abstract: Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against
verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet
remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling.
We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty
(SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training
examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency.
Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the
gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence.
Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training
without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates
seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.

*Marton Havasi,Brian Karrer,Itai Gat,Ricky T. Q. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edit Flows is a non-autoregressive model using edit operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) for flexible sequence generation, outperforming autoregressive and mask models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate variable-length sequences naturally, but non-autoregressive models struggle with rigid structures. Edit Flows aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Defines a discrete flow over sequences via edit operations, modeled within a Continuous-time Markov Chain. Uses an expanded state space with auxiliary variables for efficient training.

Result: Outperforms autoregressive and mask models in image captioning, text, and code generation.

Conclusion: Edit Flows provides a flexible and efficient alternative for sequence generation, addressing limitations of non-autoregressive models.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

### [333] [FZOO: Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models towards Adam-Scale Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09034)
*Sizhe Dang,Yangyang Guo,Yanjun Zhao,Haishan Ye,Xiaodong Zheng,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FZOO, a fast zeroth-order optimizer, improves memory efficiency and convergence speed for fine-tuning large language models, outperforming MeZO in accuracy and reducing forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing GPU memory bottlenecks in fine-tuning LLMs by improving the trade-off between speed and memory in zeroth-order optimizers.

Method: FZOO uses batched one-sided estimates, adaptive step sizes, and Rademacher random vector perturbations with CUDA parallel processing.

Result: FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3% in accuracy, reduces forward passes by 3x, and achieves Adam-scale convergence speeds.

Conclusion: FZOO enables practical single-GPU fine-tuning and suggests future work on memory-efficient pre-training.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

*Javier Sanguino,Thomas Kehrenberg,Jose A. Lozano,Novi Quadrianto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decoupled risk visualization method for Performative Prediction to complement theoretical insights with practical understanding. It also proposes an extended setting for scenarios where agents react to a different model than the deployed one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical insights in Performative Prediction by visualizing the loss landscape.

Method: Introduces a decoupled risk visualization method for model and data parameters, and extends Performative Prediction to scenarios where agents react to a different model.

Result: Provides practical insights into the risk landscape, examines algorithm behavior, and introduces a novel extended setting for Performative Prediction.

Conclusion: Visualization and the extended setting enhance understanding and applicability of Performative Prediction in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.

*Xiaowen Ma,Chenyang Lin,Yao Zhang,Volker Tresp,Yunpu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentic Neural Network (ANN), a framework for dynamic multi-agent collaboration inspired by neural network architecture, improving accuracy and adaptability over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems rely on static configurations, limiting flexibility and scalability. ANN aims to address this by dynamically optimizing agent collaboration.

Method: ANN uses a two-phase optimization: (1) Forward Phase for task decomposition and team formation, and (2) Backward Phase for iterative refinement of roles and coordination.

Result: ANN outperforms existing multi-agent baselines on four benchmark datasets, showing consistent performance gains.

Conclusion: ANN offers a scalable, data-driven approach for multi-agent systems, combining LLM collaboration with neural network efficiency. The framework will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

*Yuxin Dong,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

TL;DR: Task vectors distill task-specific info for ICL, but their workings are unclear. The Linear Combination Conjecture suggests they form via linear combinations of demonstrations, supported by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the principles behind task vectors in ICL and their empirical success.

Method: Proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, analyzes loss landscapes in linear transformers, and tests task vectors on high-rank mappings.

Result: Task vectors emerge naturally in linear transformers but fail for high-rank mappings. Saliency analyses and parameter visualization support enhancing task vectors with multiple injections.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of task vectors and ICL mechanisms in transformers, suggesting improvements for practical use.

Abstract: Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in
in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a
single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain
unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that
task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear
combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical
support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge
in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss
landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on
representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our
findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter
visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple
ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of
task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in
transformer-based models.

TL;DR: A multi-objective kernel-learning workflow is introduced to analyze ferroelectric polarization switching, revealing microstructural rules from imaging data and enabling high-throughput active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependence of ferroelectric polarization switching on local microstructural features makes systematic exploration impractical with manual or grid-based methods.

Method: A multi-objective kernel-learning workflow is applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments to infer relationships between domain-wall configurations and switching kinetics.

Result: The framework identifies how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal, projecting abstract reward functions onto interpretable descriptors.

Conclusion: The approach offers a generalizable tool for exploring complex design spaces, applicable beyond ferroelectrics to diverse imaging modalities and molecular discovery.

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in microscopy data analysis due to inconsistent formats and lack of standardized tools. It proposes hackathons to bridge the gap between ML and microscopy, resulting in benchmark datasets and digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in microscopy data analysis and integrate ML for real-time analytics and automated decision-making.

Method: Hackathons were organized to foster collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts, developing standardized workflows and tools.

Result: Benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes were created, with all code made publicly available.

Conclusion: Hackathons effectively bridge the ML-microscopy gap, enabling community growth and standardized solutions for advanced microscopy analytics.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth
and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub:

Motivation: Address instability and incorrect solutions in PINNs when using L2 loss for complex differential equations.

Method: Propose KP-PINNs with a new loss function based on RKHS norm and Kernel Packet method for acceleration.

Result: KP-PINNs demonstrate stability and efficiency in solving differential equations.

Conclusion: KP-PINNs offer a promising approach to enhance PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems.
Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have
recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have
demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss
function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the
corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex
equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet
accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel
Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that
KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical
experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations
effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for
improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific
computing.

TL;DR: Instruction-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform non-instruction-tuned models in brain alignment for video and audio tasks, showing hierarchical alignment with brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating brain alignment of MLLMs in multimodal settings, particularly with instruction-tuned models, and to understand their hierarchical alignment with brain activity.

Method: Used instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs to predict neural activity during naturalistic movie watching. Evaluated 13 video task-specific instructions.

Result: Instruction-tuned MLLMs outperformed non-instruction-tuned models by 15-20%. Hierarchical alignment was observed, with early layers matching sensory areas and later layers aligning with higher-level brain regions.

Conclusion: Task-specific instructions enhance brain-MLLM alignment, offering new insights into multimodal brain processing. The findings support further exploration of joint information processing in brains and MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

Motivation: The scarcity of challenging financial datasets, especially for Japanese data, hinders LLM development and evaluation in financial analytics.

Method: EDINET-Bench is created using 10 years of Japanese annual reports from EDINET, with automated labeling for tasks like fraud detection and earnings forecasting.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform only slightly better than logistic regression in binary classification tasks, indicating challenges in real-world financial applications.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for domain-specific LLM adaptation and provides open-source resources to advance financial analytics research.

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Markov decision process (MDP) model for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power systems, using reinforcement learning to optimize conservative actions under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern power systems with high renewable penetration face increased cascading outage risks, requiring fast, uncertain operational decisions for mitigation.

Method: Extends influence graphs into an MDP model, solved via reinforcement learning with a policy gradient algorithm, including a do-nothing action for conservatism.

Result: Proactive line disconnections reduce cascading risk, with certain lines identified as critical. The learning algorithm converges faster than conventional methods.

Conclusion: The MDP-based approach effectively mitigates cascading outages, with validated results on IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems.

Abstract: Despite high reliability, modern power systems with growing renewable
penetration face an increasing risk of cascading outages. Real-time cascade
mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In
this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model
(MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission
systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial
contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative
decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy
gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the
unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning
method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward
design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating
system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus
systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively
reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in
mitigating cascade propagation.

### [343] [syren-baryon: Analytic emulators for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08783)
*Lukas Kammerer,Deaglan J. Bartlett,Gabriel Kronberger,Harry Desmond,Pedro G. Ferreira*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: The paper presents symbolic regression-based analytic approximations for baryonic physics effects on the matter power spectrum, validated against hydrodynamical simulations and a baryonification model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Baryonic physics significantly impacts cosmological surveys, necessitating simple, interpretable parametrizations to account for these effects.

Method: Symbolic regression is used to derive analytic functions for the matter power spectrum ratio, incorporating wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and feedback parameters from CAMELS simulations and a baryonification algorithm.

Result: The approximations achieve errors comparable to sample variance and previous emulators, with physically correct behavior on large scales and high redshift.

Conclusion: The analytic forms enable direct interpretation of parameter impacts and discrimination between baryonic models, with publicly available code provided.

Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.

### [344] [A Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Generalizable CBCT to Synthetic CT Translation in Head and Neck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08654)
*Ciro Benito Raggio,Paolo Zaffino,Maria Francesca Spadea*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a federated learning (FL) approach for generating synthetic CT (sCT) from CBCT in head and neck regions, addressing data privacy and institutional heterogeneity. The method shows robust generalization across centers without centralized data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT has limitations like noise and artifacts, hindering dose calculation. Existing sCT methods face challenges due to institutional heterogeneity and data privacy.

Method: A cross-silo horizontal FL approach (FedSynthCT) using a conditional GAN was trained on multi-center data from the SynthRAD2025 challenge.

Result: The FL model achieved MAE (64.38-85.90 HU), SSIM (0.882-0.922), and PSNR (32.86-34.91 dB), with comparable performance on external validation.

Conclusion: FL is feasible for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis, preserving privacy and enabling collaborative model development without centralized data.

Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for
image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,
limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield
unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)
generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning
(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,
scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent
multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,
extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial
network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers
in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,
with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$
HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$,
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB.
Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable
performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR:
$33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust
generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT
synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for
developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data
sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: Fast and accurate soft tissue simulation is crucial for surgical robotics and medical training.

Method: Integrates Kelvinlet-based priors into neural simulators, leveraging FEM simulations for residual learning and regularization.

Result: Improves neural network predictions, achieving high-fidelity surgical maneuvers with low latency.

Conclusion: Kelvinlet-augmented learning is effective for real-time, physics-aware soft tissue simulation in surgery.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue
modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations
of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate
surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue
grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented
learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft
tissue simulation in surgical applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library for real-time 3D video stream processing, leveraging AI to synthesize light-fields from 2D inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the altiro3D Library for handling 3D video streams from 2D sources, enabling realistic 3D experiences.

Method: Uses MiDaS CNN for depth map extraction and AI techniques for performance improvement. Includes a multi-platform GUI for user-friendly screen region selection.

Result: The extended library processes 2D images, video streams, or desktop screen portions into 3D, compatible with devices like Looking Glass Portrait.

Conclusion: The updated altiro3D Library successfully integrates AI and real-time processing for versatile 3D rendering from 2D sources.

Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to
get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here
introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or
flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize
light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core
function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a
single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied
to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,
altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a
Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,
etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be
selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such
as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a
Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has
been also implemented. Sources available at:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A method for reconstructing articulated objects from casually captured RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and reconstructing articulated objects is useful for AI and robotics, but current methods require carefully captured data, limiting scalability.

Method: A coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts from dynamic RGBD videos.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs synthetic and real articulated objects, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables practical, scalable reconstruction of articulated objects from casual videos.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their
kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in
embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured
data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and
generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction
of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a
hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an
articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this
setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and
there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers
joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD
video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$
larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11
categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video
as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real
articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos,
outperforming existing methods significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance physically plausible rendering, especially for holographic displays, by modeling full light properties (amplitude and phase) in 3D.

Method: Reformulates 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, optimized using RGBD multi-view images.

Result: Achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: The method represents a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.

Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in
3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering,
particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a
novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on
intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with
complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light
waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes
complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This
eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed
improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step
towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene
representations.

Motivation: To enable faster and simpler image editing by selecting pixels sharing common modalities, robust to lighting and reflectance variations.

Method: Uses ViT models with multi-resolution processing for finer, stable selections. Introduces DuMaS dataset for texture and subtexture-level annotations.

Result: Achieves finer and more stable selection results than prior methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances material selection for downstream editing tasks, supported by a comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster
and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this
work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting
and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We
rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for
selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer
and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable
selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level
material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over
800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.

TL;DR: Flow-Lenia, a mass-conservative extension of Lenia, generates life-like patterns with complex behaviors and allows for multispecies simulations, revealing emergent evolutionary dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance artificial life by creating systems that mimic living properties like autopoiesis and evolution, using continuous cellular automata like Lenia.

Method: Propose Flow-Lenia, an extension of Lenia, and optimize its update rule parameters to generate spatially-localized patterns (SLPs) with complex behaviors.

Result: Flow-Lenia effectively produces life-like creatures with complex behaviors and enables multispecies simulations by embedding model parameters within its dynamics.

Conclusion: Flow-Lenia demonstrates potential for studying emergent evolutionary dynamics and advancing artificial life research.

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: QUITE uses LLM agents to rewrite SQL queries beyond rule-based methods, improving performance and coverage with a multi-agent framework, rewrite middleware, and hint injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based query rewrite methods are limited in handling diverse queries and can cause regressions. Human experts and LLMs offer better rewrite potential but face scalability and hallucination issues.

Method: QUITE employs a multi-agent framework controlled by an FSM, rewrite middleware, and hint injection to enhance LLM-based query rewriting with real-time feedback.

Result: QUITE reduces execution time by up to 35.8% and produces 24.1% more rewrites than state-of-the-art methods, covering previously unhandled queries.

Conclusion: QUITE demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM-based query rewriting, outperforming rule-based approaches in performance and generality.

Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that
run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite
rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance
regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query
rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite
rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques
cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts
exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and
reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL
queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly
applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address
this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and
feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into
semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a
broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based
methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite
state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and
enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we
develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate
optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection
technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive
experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over
state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior
methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

TL;DR: RADAR is a benchmark for evaluating language models' data-aware reasoning on tabular data, revealing performance gaps when handling data artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models lack robust data awareness, which is critical for valid analyses of real-world tabular data with common artifacts.

Method: Developed RADAR, a benchmark with 2980 table-query pairs, simulating data artifacts via programmatic perturbations and varying table sizes.

Result: Frontier models perform well on clean tables but degrade significantly with data artifacts, highlighting robustness gaps.

Conclusion: RADAR provides a flexible, extensible resource to advance tabular reasoning by addressing data artifact challenges.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being deployed to perform autonomous
data analyses. However, their data awareness -- the ability to recognize,
reason over, and appropriately handle data artifacts such as missing values,
outliers, and logical inconsistencies -- remains underexplored. These artifacts
are especially common in real-world tabular data and, if mishandled, can
significantly compromise the validity of analytical conclusions. To address
this gap, we present RADAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating
data-aware reasoning on tabular data. We develop a framework to simulate data
artifacts via programmatic perturbations to enable targeted evaluation of model
behavior. RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data
spanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating
artifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how
reasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals
that, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier
models degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing
critical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis. Designed to be
flexible and extensible, RADAR supports diverse perturbation types and
controllable table sizes, offering a valuable resource for advancing tabular
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for embedding-based search on local personal data faces impractical storage overhead, necessitating a solution.

Method: LEANN combines a compact graph-based structure with on-the-fly recomputation for efficient retrieval.

Result: LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of raw data, achieving 50x smaller storage with 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds.

Conclusion: LEANN effectively addresses storage challenges for local embedding-based search without compromising performance.

Abstract: Embedding-based search is widely used in applications such as recommendation
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Recently, there is a growing demand
to support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices.
However, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the
embedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead.
For example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage,
making local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining
search quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we
present LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a
compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation
strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead.
Our evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original
raw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while
maintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question
answering benchmarks.

Motivation: To enhance feedback accuracy and personalization by combining human-based and data-driven evaluation techniques.

Method: Four-step framework: 1) peer/professor assessments via rubrics, 2) multimodal data collection (video, audio, gaze, physiological signals), 3) AI-generated feedback synthesizing human and data insights, 4) student self-assessment and visualization.

Result: Enables more accurate, personalized, and actionable feedback by integrating diverse data sources and human evaluations.

Conclusion: MOSAIC-F successfully bridges human and data-driven feedback, proving effective for improving oral presentation skills.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called
MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal
Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student
learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers
and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that
include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data
are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio
capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and
behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI,
synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as
posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others.
Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and
engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own
evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and
AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based
evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and
actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common misuse of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics, particularly in interpreting inter-cluster relationships, and to understand why this happens.

Method: Conducted a literature review of 114 papers and an interview study to analyze misuse prevalence and practitioners' motivations.

Result: Misuse stems from limited discourse on proper usage of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics.

Conclusion: Proposes future directions and action items to encourage more reasonable use of dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly
common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not
faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently
use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring
this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse
occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to
verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We
then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations
for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature.
Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from
limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by
proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more
reasonable use of DR.

### [358] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework, improves sparse retrieval by combining original and LLM-augmented queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion, while enhancing sparse retrieval performance.

Method: Introduces Exp4Fuse, which fuses ranked lists from original and LLM-augmented queries using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based methods and achieves SOTA results with advanced sparse retrievers on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse is effective and superior for improving query expansion in sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

### [359] [Hierarchical Lexical Graph for Enhanced Multi-Hop Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08074)
*Abdellah Ghassel,Ian Robinson,Gabriel Tanase,Hal Cooper,Bryan Thompson,Zhen Han,Vassilis N. Ioannidis,Soji Adeshina,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Lexical Graph (HLG) to improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing gaps in piecing answers from semantically distant documents. It includes two retrievers (StatementGraphRAG and TopicGraphRAG) and a synthetic dataset for robust evaluation, showing a 23.1% improvement over naive RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with multi-hop queries requiring answers from distant documents. The paper aims to enhance retrieval by structuring propositions, topics, and entity links.

Method: Proposes HLG, a three-tier index, and two retrievers: StatementGraphRAG for factoid questions and TopicGraphRAG for exploratory queries. Introduces a synthetic dataset for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms naive RAG with a 23.1% improvement in retrieval recall and correctness across five datasets.

Conclusion: HLG and the proposed retrievers effectively address multi-hop retrieval challenges, validated by synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in
external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together
across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical
Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic
proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and
(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of
HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,
which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for
high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse
topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context
for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity
required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing
on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document
question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval
systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our
methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative
improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python
library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

### [360] [Bridging RDF Knowledge Graphs with Graph Neural Networks for Semantically-Rich Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08743)
*Michael Färber,David Lamprecht,Yuni Susanti*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating RDF knowledge graphs (KGs) with GNNs to enhance recommender systems by leveraging semantic and topological information, demonstrating significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the abundance of RDF KGs, their semantic richness is underutilized in GNN-based recommender systems. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The approach combines RDF KGs with GNNs, utilizing topological (object properties) and content (datatype properties) information, and evaluates various GNNs under different semantic feature initializations and graph structure heterogeneity.

Result: Experiments on multi-million-node RDF graphs show that leveraging RDF KGs' semantic richness significantly improves recommender system performance.

Conclusion: The work advances GNN-based recommender systems for the Linked Open Data cloud, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our
GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

### [361] [Multimodal Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08774)
*Fan Xu,Luis A. Leiva*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores feature alignment in multimodal retrieval, comparing geometric relationships and alignment methods between visual and textual embeddings, with Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity as key findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning representations across modalities (e.g., text and images) for effective multimodal retrieval in real-world applications.

Method: Investigates geometric relationships between embeddings, uses four standard and two learned similarity metrics (including neural networks), and evaluates alignment performance.

Result: Wasserstein distance measures modality gap; cosine similarity excels in alignment. Conventional architectures like MLPs fail to capture complex cross-modal interactions.

Conclusion: Provides insights and practical guidance for multimodal retrieval, emphasizing the effectiveness of cosine similarity and limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept
in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild
multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding
representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge
can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a
sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned
image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this
work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and
textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined
unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard
similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural
networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an
informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently
outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we
observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are
insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text
representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations
for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in
real-world, cross-modal applications.

TL;DR: ChemGraph is an AI-driven framework automating computational chemistry workflows, combining graph neural networks and LLMs for efficiency and ease of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in atomistic simulations due to diverse methods, software, and manual effort.

Method: Uses graph neural networks for calculations and LLMs for task planning, offering an interactive interface for various computational tasks.

Result: Smaller LLMs handle simple workflows well, while complex tasks benefit from larger models; task decomposition improves performance.

Conclusion: ChemGraph streamlines simulations, making them more accessible and efficient, with potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science,
accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and
pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to
the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the
need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and
validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework
powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to
streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science
workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for
accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models
(LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific
reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform
tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry
optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with
methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials
to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate
ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs
(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,
while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.
Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks
through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed
GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for interpretable decision rules that balance accuracy, sparsity, and stability.

Method: Uses a cutting plane algorithm to compute the Pareto frontier between accuracy and stability, scalable beyond commercial solvers.

Result: MOSS outperforms existing rule ensembles in predictive performance and stability.

Conclusion: MOSS provides a practical tool for practitioners to evaluate trade-offs and select optimal models.

Abstract: We present MOSS, a multi-objective optimization framework for constructing
stable sets of decision rules. MOSS incorporates three important criteria for
interpretability: sparsity, accuracy, and stability, into a single
multi-objective optimization framework. Importantly, MOSS allows a practitioner
to rapidly evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and stability in sparse rule
sets in order to select an appropriate model. We develop a specialized cutting
plane algorithm in our framework to rapidly compute the Pareto frontier between
these two objectives, and our algorithm scales to problem instances beyond the
capabilities of commercial optimization solvers. Our experiments show that MOSS
outperforms state-of-the-art rule ensembles in terms of both predictive
performance and stability.

TL;DR: A continuous policy-value iteration algorithm using Langevin-type dynamics for stochastic control problems, applicable to entropy-regularized and classical control problems, with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simultaneously update value function approximations and optimal control through Langevin dynamics, leveraging machine learning techniques for optimization.

Method: Uses Langevin-type stochastic differential equations for continuous updates during policy iteration, enabling distribution sampling and non-convex learning.

Result: Policy improvement is established, with convergence to optimal control under Hamiltonian monotonicity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines control theory and machine learning for optimizing value functions and identifying optimal controls.

Abstract: We introduce a continuous policy-value iteration algorithm where the
approximations of the value function of a stochastic control problem and the
optimal control are simultaneously updated through Langevin-type dynamics. This
framework applies to both the entropy-regularized relaxed control problems and
the classical control problems, with infinite horizon. We establish policy
improvement and demonstrate convergence to the optimal control under the
monotonicity condition of the Hamiltonian. By utilizing Langevin-type
stochastic differential equations for continuous updates along the policy
iteration direction, our approach enables the use of distribution sampling and
non-convex learning techniques in machine learning to optimize the value
function and identify the optimal control simultaneously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x \in
\mathcal{X}} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} f(x,y)$ with
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order oracle calls using Newton-type
methods. This result has been speculated to be optimal because the upper bound
is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal first-order method. In
this work, we show an improved upper bound of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$ by generalizing the optimal second-order
method for convex optimization to solve the convex-concave minimax problem. We
further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian algorithms and show that our
proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order ``Catalyst'' framework
(Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally convergent
algorithms for solving minimax problems.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for understanding how reduction mappings improve optimization by exploiting geometric structures in high-dimensional problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional optimization problems often have smooth manifolds of minimizers due to over-parametrization or symmetries. Leveraging this structure can accelerate convergence.

Method: The study uses reduction mappings to reparametrize the parameter space, removing redundant directions and improving curvature properties of the objective.

Result: Well-designed reduction mappings enhance problem conditioning and theoretically speed up convergence for gradient-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework unifies scenarios where structural information is used to accelerate optimization, explaining empirical gains observed in such algorithms.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures
in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to
over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least
locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part
of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions
naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove
redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we
introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the
optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve
curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems
and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis
unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is
leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the
empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.

### [367] [Optimization over Sparse Support-Preserving Sets: Two-Step Projection with Global Optimality Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08558)
*William de Vazelhes,Xiao-Tong Yuan,Bin Gu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new iterative hard-thresholding algorithm for sparse optimization with extra support-preserving constraints, offering global convergence guarantees under standard assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sparse optimization with mixed constraints lack global guarantees or require impractical projections. This work aims to address these limitations.

Method: A two-step consecutive projection operator is proposed, replacing the Euclidean projection, and a trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality is introduced.

Result: The algorithm provides global guarantees in deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, improving upon prior work by removing non-vanishing system errors.

Conclusion: The proposed method fills a gap in sparse optimization with mixed constraints, offering a simpler and globally convergent alternative.

Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$
pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex
relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity
constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been
developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex
constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed
constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of
convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in
sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of
sparse optimization with extra \qw{\textit{support-preserving}} constraints
commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative
hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection
operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple
alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By
introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,
we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our
algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under
the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a
fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of
the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection
operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an
elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the
zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art
result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional
constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in
their work.

*Matthias Beckmann,Robert Beinert,Jonas Bresch*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces max-normalized and mean-normalized versions of the Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) to improve robustness against non-affine image deformations and impulsive noise, ensuring linear separability in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the R-CDT in handling general affine transformations and non-affine deformations in real-world applications like watermark recognition.

Method: Develops max-normalized and mean-normalized R-CDT variants, analyzing their robustness using Wasserstein-infinity and Wasserstein-2 distances, respectively.

Result: The proposed variants maintain separability under controlled deformations and noise, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The new R-CDT variants are effective and robust for image classification, especially in challenging scenarios with non-affine deformations and noise.

Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute
feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the
small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and
provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from
translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition
of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine
transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this
issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only
requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary
affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the
max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against
non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its
separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance
between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance
only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a
mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the
Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive
noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well
as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional algebraic factorizations (e.g., LU, SVD) by proposing a variational approach that allows control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning.

Method: The $D$-decomposition ($A \approx P D Q$) is computed via alternating minimization, minimizing a regularized Frobenius loss. Theoretical analysis includes existence, stability, and update complexity ($\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$).

Result: Benchmarks on datasets (MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, gene expression) show improved reconstruction accuracy compared to truncated SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization, especially under sparsity and noise.

Conclusion: The $D$-decomposition is a robust and flexible alternative to existing factorization methods, offering better performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of
the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The
decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius
loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic
factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization.
We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that
each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated
SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction
accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices,
particularly under sparsity and noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in high-dimensional tensor decomposition by introducing a geometric perspective, avoiding explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation.

Method: Unfolds the tensor into subproblems reformulated as structured binary linear optimization, transforming the nonconvex objective into a tractable geometric form.

Result: Achieves linear computational complexity, accurate sparse support recovery, high compression performance, and robust image reconstruction.

Conclusion: sparseGeoHOPCA is efficient, interpretable, and versatile for high-dimensional tensor analysis.

Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order
principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective
to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along
each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary
linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex
sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for
explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant
gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in
high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the
equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA
formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on
classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The
proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of
$O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with
tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately
recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification
performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image
reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between LLMs and symbolic reasoning, particularly for complex tasks like worst-case execution analysis.

Method: Defines worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, evaluates LLMs on this task, and enhances their capabilities with SMT-guided fine-tuning and a custom dataset.

Result: The solver-aligned model (WARP-1.0-3B) outperforms baselines, showing LLMs can recover worst-case constraints via reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: LLMs can engage in deeper symbolic reasoning, suggesting potential integration of neural learning and formal methods for program analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of
coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more
complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper
investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in
programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and
symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem
of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the
comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this
novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic
reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic
constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model,
WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger
baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that
pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning
methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper
symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural
network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precision and interpretability in complex software tasks, prompting the need for a structured approach like Repeton.

Method: Repeton uses a patch-and-test pipeline with lightweight heuristics and tools, avoiding embedding-based retrieval.

Result: Evaluated on SWE-bench Lite, Repeton shows better performance than RAG-based methods in validity and interpretability.

Conclusion: Repeton offers a scalable, transparent solution for autonomous debugging by modularizing software tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code
generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software
engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited
interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that
leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git
repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a
structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes
code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise
process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding
reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite
benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in
both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering
tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic study of software engineering agents (SWE agents) using execution traces, proposing a taxonomy of decision-making pathways and analyzing core components like bug localization and patch generation. It also compares agent-generated patches with developer-written ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal decision-making workflows of SWE agents, which remain poorly understood, to improve their reliability and efficiency.

Method: The study uses execution traces to analyze SWE agents, proposes a taxonomy of decision-making pathways, and examines core components like bug localization and patch generation. It also conducts a large-scale code clone analysis.

Result: The study identifies key components for agent success, analyzes the impact of test generation on patch production, and reveals differences between agent-generated and developer-written patches.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for improving SWE agent design and aligning them with human development practices.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents
(SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of
software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These
agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to
environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated
strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive
their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows
hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work,
we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of
execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first
taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2)
using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent
success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation
-- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on
successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful
test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone
analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a
qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch
content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and
open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned
with human development practices.

Motivation: To address the lack of studies on the environmental impact of AI-generated code and its adherence to sustainable coding practices.

Method: An early investigation into the sustainability of code generated by ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot, evaluating their adoption of green coding practices.

Result: The tools exhibit default non-green behaviors in code generation, highlighting sustainability concerns.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for deeper research and strategies to improve the sustainability of AI-generated code.

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize
resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener,
more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software
is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a
maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on
these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their
potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the
sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally
friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding
practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into
the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative
AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default
non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and
scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and
effective remediation strategies.

*Samah Kansab,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper identifies deviations in Merge Request workflows, proposes a detection method, and shows their impact on ML models for review analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial Merge Request workflows often deviate from standard review processes, potentially biasing analytics and ML models.

Method: The study identifies seven deviation categories, proposes a few-shot learning detection method, and evaluates its impact on ML models.

Result: Deviations occur in 37.02% of MRs; excluding them improves ML model performance in 53.33% of cases and shifts feature importance.

Conclusion: The work provides a taxonomy, detection method, and evidence of deviations' impact, aiding practitioners in optimizing review efforts.

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the R package 'midr' for interpretable machine learning, using Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID) to create low-order additive representations of black-box models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for explainability in black-box predictive models, especially in fields requiring transparency.

Method: Proposes MID, a functional decomposition approach minimizing squared error between the black-box model and its additive representation.

Result: The 'midr' package successfully implements MID, enabling global surrogate models with analytical capabilities.

Conclusion: The 'midr' package is a novel tool for interpreting black-box models, enhancing explainability and usability.

Abstract: The use of appropriate methods of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) and
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for adopting black-box
predictive models in fields where model and prediction explainability is
required. As a novel tool for interpreting black-box models, we introduce the R
package midr, which implements Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID). MID
is a functional decomposition approach that derives a low-order additive
representation of a black-box model by minimizing the squared error between the
model's prediction function and this additive representation. midr enables
learning from black-box models by constructing a global surrogate model with
advanced analytical capabilities. After reviewing related work and the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions for Caco-2 permeability to aid early-stage drug discovery.

Method: Systematic investigation of eight molecular feature representations (2D/3D descriptors, fingerprints, deep learning embeddings) combined with AutoML, tested on two datasets (TDC benchmark and OCHEM data).

Result: PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit descriptors were most effective; AutoML model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE. 3D descriptors reduced MAE by 15.73% compared to 2D features.

Conclusion: AutoML is effective for ADMET modeling, and 3D features enhance predictions, providing practical guidance for feature selection in data-limited tasks.

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

TL;DR: Protriever is a fast, end-to-end framework for retrieving homologous protein sequences, outperforming traditional MSA-based methods in speed and performance for tasks like fitness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MSA-based retrieval is slow, struggles with divergent sequences, and ignores downstream modeling goals. Protriever addresses these limitations.

Method: Protriever learns to retrieve homologs while training for the target task, using efficient vector search for speed.

Result: Protriever achieves state-of-the-art performance in fitness prediction, is two orders of magnitude faster than MSA-based methods, and is adaptable to various tasks and databases.

Conclusion: Protriever offers a scalable, efficient alternative to alignment-centric approaches for protein sequence retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence
Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.
However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with
highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and
operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce
Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve
relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When
applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog
retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector
search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly
adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time
-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.

*Wenlong Meng,Shuguo Fan,Chengkun Wei,Min Chen,Yuwei Li,Yuanchao Zhang,Zhikun Zhang,Wenzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GradEscape is a gradient-based evader for attacking AI-generated text detectors, overcoming undifferentiable computation and tokenizer mismatch issues, and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of attacking AI-generated text detectors due to discrete text nature and tokenizer mismatches.

Method: Uses weighted embeddings, warm-started evader, tokenizer inference, and model extraction to evade detectors with minimal text modification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art evaders, achieving high success with fewer parameters, and works on real-world detectors.

Conclusion: GradEscape exposes vulnerabilities in detectors and proposes a defense strategy, with the tool open-sourced for improving detector robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GradEscape, the first gradient-based evader
designed to attack AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors. GradEscape overcomes the
undifferentiable computation problem, caused by the discrete nature of text, by
introducing a novel approach to construct weighted embeddings for the detector
input. It then updates the evader model parameters using feedback from victim
detectors, achieving high attack success with minimal text modification. To
address the issue of tokenizer mismatch between the evader and the detector, we
introduce a warm-started evader method, enabling GradEscape to adapt to
detectors across any language model architecture. Moreover, we employ novel
tokenizer inference and model extraction techniques, facilitating effective
evasion even in query-only access.
  We evaluate GradEscape on four datasets and three widely-used language
models, benchmarking it against four state-of-the-art AIGT evaders.
Experimental results demonstrate that GradEscape outperforms existing evaders
in various scenarios, including with an 11B paraphrase model, while utilizing
only 139M parameters. We have successfully applied GradEscape to two real-world
commercial AIGT detectors. Our analysis reveals that the primary vulnerability
stems from disparity in text expression styles within the training data. We
also propose a potential defense strategy to mitigate the threat of AIGT
evaders. We open-source our GradEscape for developing more robust AIGT
detectors.

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies in cybersecurity access control, highlighting challenges in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs in security-critical domains like access control.

Method: Two approaches: generating configurations from natural language prompts alone and with official documentation, then evaluating soundness, accuracy, and consistency.

Result: Significant challenges in LLM-generated configurations were identified.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for improving LLM deployment in access control systems.

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing
to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However,
despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs
present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as
access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency
of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable
operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of
Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the
consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating
natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files.
Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we
utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural
language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models
with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline.
We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these
AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in
the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining
the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

*Li Changjiang,Liang Jiacheng,Cao Bochuan,Chen Jinghui,Wang Ting*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ReAgent is a novel defense against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents, detecting inconsistencies between instructions, planning, and execution to mitigate risks effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents face security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning, necessitating robust defenses.

Method: ReAgent uses a two-level approach: verifying thought-action consistency at execution and reconstructing instructions from thought trajectories at planning.

Result: ReAgent reduces attack success rates by up to 90% in tasks like database operations, outperforming existing defenses.

Conclusion: ReAgent demonstrates the potential of leveraging compromised agents to mitigate backdoor risks effectively.

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

*Tingzhi Li,Xuefeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WGLE introduces a black-box watermarking method for GNNs, embedding multi-bit ownership info without backdoors, using Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (fingerprinting, black-box watermarking) have flaws: computational expense, backdoor risks, and lack of info embedding. WGLE aims to solve these.

Method: WGLE uses LDDE to embed watermarks by quantifying feature-prediction distance differences on edges, avoiding backdoors.

Result: Achieves 100% verification accuracy, minimal fidelity degradation (0.85%), robustness against attacks, and low overhead.

Conclusion: WGLE is a robust, efficient solution for GNN ownership verification without backdoor risks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related
applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their
intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box
watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining
model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership
collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.
The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of
backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do
not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires
a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the
suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost
and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box
watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as
the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight
we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the
difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two
connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple
selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information
without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE
is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along
with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100%
ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%,
comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes two deep reinforcement learning agents in a cyber defense challenge, focusing on interpretability of agent behavior, effectiveness of actions, and the impact of decoy services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and interpret the successes and failures of deep reinforcement learning agents in a simulated cyber defense scenario.

Method: Simplified state and action spaces, tracked important events, and analyzed transitions in the environment's state.

Result: Defenders cleared infiltrations quickly; certain actions were highly ineffective (40-99%); decoys blocked up to 94% of privileged exploits.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into agent behavior and effectiveness, with implications for improving future cyber defense challenges like CAGE Challenge 4.

Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to
the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted
an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided
rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of
agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces
and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior
of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By
analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns
in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and
defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally
able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being
exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the
various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and
which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99%
ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding
for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant
privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge
and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper addresses multiuser scheduling in MIMO-OFDM hybrid beamforming systems for mmWave channels, aiming to maximize proportional fairness (PF) by optimizing analog/digital precoders and user selection. It proposes combinatorial and ML-based solutions, highlighting performance-complexity trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improved scheduling is crucial for spectral efficiency and long-term performance in hybrid beamforming systems due to limited multiplexing gain, especially in mmWave channels.

Method: A two-timescale protocol is used: long timescale for analog beam assignment and short timescale for user scheduling and digital precoder design. Combinatorial (greedy, sorting) and ML approaches are proposed.

Result: Numerical results reveal trade-offs between performance and complexity, suggesting approach selection depends on scenario-specific criteria.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods for PF maximization in hybrid beamforming systems, with ML offering potential but requiring careful consideration of complexity.

Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with
multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved
scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term
performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF)
metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our
objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital
precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the
number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave
channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an
analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital
precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we
propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms,
followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight
the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed
approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the
specific criteria within a given scenario.

TL;DR: A new CNN-based method for accurate pupil and corneal reflection identification in rodent eyes addresses unique challenges like small size and hair interference, improving gaze tracking for neuroscience research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing eye tracking techniques focus on humans, neglecting rodent-specific challenges such as variability in eye parameters and surrounding hair.

Method: The paper introduces a flexible, robust CNN architecture for biomedical image segmentation, incrementally trainable to adapt to rodent eye variability.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in pupil and corneal reflection identification, paired with an automated infrared video system for state-of-the-art rodent eye tracking.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical, accurate solution for rodent gaze tracking, advancing neuroscience and vision science research.

Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful
measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely
studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage
and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing
techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy
to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been
made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms,
unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which
does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g.,
variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small
size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible,
robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection
identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained
to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly
accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural
network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye
images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased
eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking
for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality volumetric meshing is crucial for physics-based simulations in personalized medicine, but existing DL-based methods have limitations in flexibility and realism.

Method: The study introduces a snap-and-tune strategy, sequentially applying DL and test-time optimization for fast initial fitting and detailed mesh corrections.

Result: The method significantly improves spatial accuracy and mesh quality, demonstrated via solid mechanics simulations in two software platforms.

Conclusion: The snap-and-tune strategy is effective, automated, and versatile, with potential applications in personalized medicine.

Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for
physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of
complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning
(DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation
with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit
limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and
unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet
effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time
optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed
sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements
in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and
requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the
versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics
simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at

TL;DR: PnP-Nystra is a Nyström-based linear approximation of self-attention, offering a plug-and-play module for efficient acceleration in transformer architectures without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in vision models creates computational bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: PnP-Nystra approximates self-attention linearly using the Nyström method, serving as a drop-in replacement for MHSA in pre-trained models.

Result: Achieves 2-5x speed-up on CPU/GPU with a maximum PSNR drop of 1.5 dB across image and video restoration tasks.

Conclusion: PnP-Nystra is the first linear attention method functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern
computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input
length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource
constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear
approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that
can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models
without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables
efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures,
including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and
video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution,
demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU
and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the
method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention
functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.

*Donglian Li,Hui Guo,Minglang Chen,Huizhen Chen,Jialing Chen,Bocheng Liang,Pengchen Liang,Ying Tan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes DCD, a deep learning model for accurate segmentation of fetal A4C echocardiography, addressing challenges like noise and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) requires precise segmentation of fetal A4C views, hindered by ultrasound artifacts and anatomical variability.

Method: DCD integrates Dense ASPP for multi-scale feature extraction and CBAM for adaptive feature representation.

Result: DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, improving prenatal cardiac assessment.

Conclusion: DCD enhances segmentation accuracy, reducing sonographer workload and aiding CHD diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber
(A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and
prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise
segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise,
anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational
stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation
accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic
segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model
incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module,
enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By
effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD
achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal
cardiac assessment.

*Rinat Prochii,Elizaveta Dakhova,Pavel Birulin,Maxim Sharaev*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework is introduced to classify 16 fetal structures in second-trimester ultrasound images, achieving high accuracy despite challenges like low image quality and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately classifying fetal ultrasound images due to low quality, high variability, and class imbalance motivates the development of a robust, scalable solution.

Method: The model uses a hierarchical, modular approach with two complementary branches (shallow for coarse cues, detailed for fine features) and combines their outputs. It employs EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss.

Result: The model achieves >0.75 accuracy for 90% of organs and >0.85 for 75%, outperforming simpler models on a large number of classes.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired modular stacking proves effective for robust fetal anatomy recognition in noisy, real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains
challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and
significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful,
biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior
studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously
distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular
organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary
branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed"
path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final
prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large
number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and
evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three
experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and
variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our
ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies
90% of organs with accuracy > 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy >
0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer
categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular
stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging
clinical settings.

*Milica Škipina,Nikola Jovišić,Nicola Dall'Asen,Vanja Švenda,Anil Osman Tur,Slobodan Ilić,Elisa Ricci,Dubravko Ćulibrk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAMBO, a patch-based diffusion model for generating high-resolution mammograms to address data scarcity in AI training for breast cancer detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training AI systems for mammography requires large, diverse datasets, which are hard to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints.

Method: MAMBO uses separate diffusion models to capture local and global contexts, integrating them into a patch-based model for high-resolution (3840x3840 pixels) mammogram generation.

Result: MAMBO successfully generates realistic mammograms, aiding in training classification models and anomaly detection, validated by radiologists.

Conclusion: MAMBO enhances mammography analysis, improving accuracy and early lesion detection, with potential applications in super-resolution and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying
abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse
datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical
constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle
mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate
full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in
realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and
none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture
fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates
separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)
contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based
model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design
enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840
pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of
classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both
numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image
generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential
to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion
detection.

*Maximilian Tschuchnig,Lukas Lamminger,Philipp Steininger,Michael Gadermayr*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal learning approach to enhance synthetic CT (sCT) generation from CBCT, integrating preoperative CT with intraoperative CBCT, showing significant improvements, especially in low-quality CBCT cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT, while fast and low-dose, suffers from artifacts and lower quality compared to conventional CT. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation aims to mitigate these issues.

Method: The study uses multimodal learning to combine intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT, validated on real-world and synthetic datasets to analyze alignment and CBCT quality effects.

Result: Multimodal sCT outperforms unimodal baselines, with the most gains in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases, and findings are reproducible in clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning significantly improves sCT quality, particularly for challenging CBCT cases, demonstrating clinical applicability.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time
intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition
speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant
artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed
Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we
enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative
CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use
a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT
quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT
consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains
observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate
that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing troubleshooting methods for traditional systems are inadequate for modern GPU clusters due to scale, complexity, and data intensity.

Method: PerfTracker uses fine-grained profiling and differential observability to diagnose issues with minimal production impact.

Result: Deployed on clusters with ~10,000 GPUs, it successfully diagnoses various performance issues.

Conclusion: PerfTracker is a scalable and effective solution for troubleshooting LMT performance problems in production.

Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is
immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the
complexity of software-hardware interactions, and the data intensity of the
training process. Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional
distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to
real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first
online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose
performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can
diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their
interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It
scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes
runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling,
and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with
minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production
service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage

*Jiayu Li,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan,Yihong Ma,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: DCIDA is a framework for inverse design in distributed circuits, using a Transformer-based policy to sample near-optimal designs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with non-differentiable evaluations, varying topologies, and continuous placement spaces. DCIDA addresses these limitations.

Method: DCIDA learns a sampling policy for design factors via jointly-trained conditional distributions, using an injective map for physical representation.

Result: DCIDA reduces design error significantly, especially for complex transfer functions, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: DCIDA offers a robust solution for inverse design, handling real-world constraints effectively.

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

TL;DR: A CNN and MLP surrogate model reduces computational cost for radiative heat transfer simulations, with CNN outperforming MLP in precision and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs in numerical simulations of radiative heat transfer.

Method: Adapted CNN and MLP architectures trained on datasets from ICARUS2D solver, with hyper-parameters optimized via Optuna.

Result: Significant speedup with acceptable errors; CNN is more precise and robust than MLP.

Conclusion: CNN is superior for surrogate modeling in radiative heat transfer, offering efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are
introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer
solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of
this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall
properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for
image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical
solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the
statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is
compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy.
Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters
networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable
relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures.
Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more
robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the
dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper
understanding of the model behavior.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves DST performance, especially for named entities, and sets new benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we approach spoken Dialogue State Tracking (DST) by bridging
the representation spaces of speech encoders and LLMs via a small connector
module, with a focus on fully open-sourced and open-data components
(WavLM-large, OLMo). We focus on ablating different aspects of such systems
including full/LoRA adapter fine-tuning, the effect of agent turns in the
dialogue history, as well as fuzzy matching-based output post-processing, which
greatly improves performance of our systems on named entities in the dialogue
slot values. We conduct our experiments on the SpokenWOZ dataset, and
additionally utilize the Speech-Aware MultiWOZ dataset to augment our training
data. Ultimately, our best-performing WavLM + connector + OLMo-1B aligned
models achieve state of the art on the SpokenWOZ test set (34.66% JGA), and our
system with Gemma-2-9B-instruct further surpasses this result, reaching 42.17%
JGA on SpokenWOZ test.

TL;DR: The paper proposes TS-PIELM, a time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine, to improve accuracy and efficiency in soil consolidation analyses over conventional PINN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of PINN in accuracy and efficiency for soil consolidation problems.

Method: Divides consolidation into time intervals, uses single-layer ELM with random fixed input weights, and computes output weights via linear equations.

Result: TS-PIELM improves computational efficiency by 1000x and accuracy by 100x over PINN in 1D cases.

Conclusion: TS-PIELM demonstrates PIML's potential as a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.

Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network
(PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil
consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning
(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine
(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into
numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in
solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network
training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme
learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in
PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and
fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are
directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly
enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient
descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is
demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared
to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the
novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for
one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence
that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.

Result: Experiments on CARLA show performance gains in local trajectory planning due to improved prediction accuracy from information sharing.

Conclusion: CALL effectively enhances MARL performance by balancing communication efficiency and predictive generalization.

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex
high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to
suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity}
issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed,
which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming
communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI
embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop
{\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d
Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model
that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation
with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of
interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out
ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich
her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve
prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction
accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap.
Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory

Conclusion: The integration of NMPC and DRL in Re4MPC offers a promising solution for efficient motion planning in complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Motivation: To address VLMs' limited ability to comprehend physical phenomena in structured 3D environments, PhyBlock is introduced to assess and improve their spatial and physical reasoning.

Method: PhyBlock combines a four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task with VQA samples, evaluating VLMs on partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness across 2600 tasks.

Result: Benchmarking 21 VLMs shows pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning, with minimal improvement from chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: PhyBlock serves as a testbed to bridge vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving, highlighting VLMs' current shortcomings.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities
in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend
physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains
severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive
benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning
through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level
cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering
(VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning
and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial
relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block
tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three
key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and
limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings
indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in
high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in
performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals
persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning.
Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements,
suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We
position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging
vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

Conclusion: Hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are crucial for next-gen autonomous systems, and the paper outlines a roadmap for their development.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive

paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven
significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in
their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic

deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging
differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for

Conclusion: The autonomous prosthetic hand system offers a user-friendly, low-effort solution for limb loss patients.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing
quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and
semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each
control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to
develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to
automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera
attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will
automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to
the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,
just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will
automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb
loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce
mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation
system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand
control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand
actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data
from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning
algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and
unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at

### [405] [FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822)
*Yifei Su,Ning Liu,Dong Chen,Zhen Zhao,Kun Wu,Meng Li,Zhiyuan Xu,Zhengping Che,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FreqPolicy improves real-time robotic manipulation by enforcing frequency consistency in visuomotor policies, enabling efficient one-step action generation while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative modeling-based visuomotor policies face high inference costs and lack temporal coherence in action trajectories, limiting real-time applicability.

Method: FreqPolicy introduces frequency consistency constraints and an adaptive consistency loss to align frequency-domain action features and capture temporal variations, enabling one-step action generation.

Result: FreqPolicy outperforms existing one-step generators in 53 simulation tasks, integrates seamlessly into vision-language-action models, and achieves 93.5Hz inference in real-world scenarios without performance loss.

Conclusion: FreqPolicy effectively addresses temporal coherence and efficiency in robotic manipulation, offering a practical solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A neural network-based algorithm (NQES) efficiently computes multiple low-lying excited states in quantum many-body systems without explicit orthogonalization, demonstrated on models like Haldane-Shastry and trapped-ion systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excited states in quantum many-body systems are crucial but computationally challenging due to exponential Hilbert space scaling.

Method: The NQES algorithm uses neural networks to compute multiple excited states without orthogonalization, tested on Haldane-Shastry and trapped-ion models.

Result: NQES accurately computes excited states and observables, matching experimental correlations and uncovering gap scaling in large systems.

Conclusion: NQES is a scalable, efficient method for excited states, with applications in quantum benchmarking and photoisomerization.

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

TL;DR: The paper explores quadratization methods for higher-order problems in ML to enable Quantum Annealing (QA) solutions, proposing a new approach using rectified linear unit bases and a black-box optimization scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend QA's applicability to complex ML problems with strong nonlinearity and dense interactions, which conventional quadratization methods cannot handle.

Method: Model target functions using rectified linear unit bases, which allow universal approximation and equivalent quadratic-polynomial representation, and integrate QA with this quadratization for black-box optimization.

Result: Proof of concept is verified numerically and analytically, and a new QA-based black-box optimization scheme is designed.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of conventional quadratization for ML problems, enabling QA to solve them effectively.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA,
quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs.
However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning
(ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense
interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we
model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not
only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent
quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is
verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with
the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in
which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization
process.

TL;DR: The paper explores the interplay between adversarial robustness and generalization in variational quantum models, proposing a regularization-based training approach using Lipschitz bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored relationship between adversarial robustness and generalization in quantum machine learning, particularly for variational quantum models.

Method: Uses Lipschitz bounds to quantify robustness and generalization, leading to a regularization-based training approach.

Result: Demonstrates practical implications with an application to time series analysis.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of trainable data encoding strategies for robust and generalizable quantum models.

Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which
explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a
regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum
models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The
practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an
application to time series analysis.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores using adiabatic quantum computers for generating human-like passwords, leveraging QUBO and UD-MIS encodings, and demonstrates success with small samples on a 256-qubit quantum computer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if quantum computing can reduce resource demands for generative NLP tasks, focusing on password generation as a feasible application.

Method: Proposes QUBO and UD-MIS encodings for token strings, estimates token distributions, and adiabatically prepares quantum states for password sampling.

Result: Generated 128 passwords on a 256-qubit quantum computer, including realistic examples like "Tunas200992" and "teedem28iglove".

Conclusion: Adiabatic quantum computing shows promise for small-scale generative NLP tasks like password generation, though scalability remains a challenge.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for
Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce
the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While
large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical
quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as
passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many
applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic
threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently
been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel,
realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility
of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study
different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum
Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token
distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we
eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show
that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila
256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as
"Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

TL;DR: Superposed parameterised quantum circuits (SPQCs) enhance quantum machine learning by embedding exponential sub-models and enabling polynomial activation functions, outperforming traditional methods in expressivity and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum machine learning methods are limited by linear unitary operations and shared parameters, restricting expressivity and scalability compared to classical deep networks.

Method: SPQCs combine flip-flop quantum random-access memory and repeat-until-success protocols to embed multiple parameter sets and induce non-linear activation functions via amplitude transformations and post-selection.

Result: SPQCs significantly reduce mean-squared error in regression tasks (three orders of magnitude) and improve classification accuracy (81.4%) with reduced variance.

Conclusion: SPQCs offer a hardware-efficient path to deeper, more versatile quantum circuits for complex learning tasks.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data
analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and
shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit
expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear
architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised
quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum
random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed
parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised
sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions
through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic
description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are
trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden
representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical
experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a
two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error
by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;
on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a
quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance
three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as
a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum
circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

*Julien Fageot,Peva Blanchard,Gilles Bareilles,Lê-Nguyên Hoang*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors to ensure monotonicity in preference learning, improving accuracy, especially with limited datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, often lack monotonicity guarantees, and the only proven monotone models (Generalized Bradley-Terry) fail to generalize to uncompared data.

Method: The authors propose Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors and identify sufficient conditions on embeddings to guarantee monotonicity.

Result: Experiments show that monotonicity is rare in general models, and the new class improves accuracy, particularly with limited data.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of monotone models with generalization ability, offering a practical solution for preference learning.

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another
alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is,
the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps
surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,
including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the
only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be
monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable
to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding
of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we
propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion
Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that
guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from
being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models
improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

TL;DR: TelePiT, a deep learning model, improves S2S forecasting by integrating multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current S2S forecasting lacks explicit modeling of physical processes and teleconnections, limiting accuracy.

Method: TelePiT combines Spherical Harmonic Embedding, Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, and Teleconnection-Aware Transformer.

Result: TelePiT reduces RMSE for 2-meter temperature by 57.7% compared to prior models.

Conclusion: TelePiT advances S2S forecasting by effectively modeling physical and teleconnection dynamics.

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WWAggr, a novel ensemble aggregation method for Change Point Detection (CPD) using Wasserstein distance, addressing suboptimal standard techniques and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world high-dimensional CPD is challenging due to data complexity and flawed assumptions, with current deep neural network detectors lacking perfect quality. Ensembling offers robustness but standard aggregation methods are suboptimal.

Method: The authors propose WWAggr, a task-specific ensemble aggregation method based on the Wasserstein distance, designed to work with various deep CPD models and address decision threshold selection.

Result: WWAggr effectively improves ensemble performance in CPD, outperforming standard aggregation techniques and solving the threshold selection problem.

Conclusion: WWAggr provides a versatile and robust solution for ensemble-based CPD, enhancing detection quality and addressing long-standing challenges.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for identifying the Pareto Set under feasibility constraints in multivariate bandits, outperforming existing methods and proving near-optimal sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of identifying Pareto-optimal arms under linear constraints in a bandit setting, where existing methods like racing or two-stage approaches are suboptimal.

Method: Proposes a new algorithm for fixed-confidence identification of the constrained Pareto Set, leveraging information-theoretic principles.

Result: The algorithm significantly outperforms baseline methods, and its sample complexity is proven near-optimal via a lower bound.

Conclusion: The approach is theoretically sound and empirically validated, offering an efficient solution for constrained Pareto Set identification.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of identifying the Pareto Set under
feasibility constraints in a multivariate bandit setting. Specifically, given a
$K$-armed bandit with unknown means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the
goal is to identify the set of arms whose mean is not uniformly worse than that
of another arm (i.e., not smaller for all objectives), while satisfying some
known set of linear constraints, expressing, for example, some minimal
performance on each objective. Our focus lies in fixed-confidence
identification, for which we introduce an algorithm that significantly
outperforms racing-like algorithms and the intuitive two-stage approach that
first identifies feasible arms and then their Pareto Set. We further prove an
information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for
constrained Pareto Set identification, showing that the sample complexity of
our approach is near-optimal. Our theoretical results are supported by an
extensive empirical evaluation on a series of benchmarks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-free uncertainty quantification algorithm using conditional depth measures for prediction regions in complex data, with conformal prediction for finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored integration of depth measures into regression modeling for prediction regions in complex data like high-dimensional or functional data.

Method: Proposes conditional depth measures (conditional kernel mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure) and a conformal prediction variant for finite samples.

Result: Achieves faster convergence rates, conditional/unconditional consistency, and performs well in simulations and a digital health application.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for uncertainty quantification in complex data, with practical utility demonstrated in simulations and real-world applications.

Abstract: Depth measures are powerful tools for defining level sets in emerging,
non--standard, and complex random objects such as high-dimensional multivariate
data, functional data, and random graphs. Despite their favorable theoretical
properties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to
provide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To
address this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification
algorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel
mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be
used to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses
are defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings
ensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance
the practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce
a conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic
guarantees for the derived prediction regions. Additionally, we establish both
conditional and unconditional consistency results, as well as fast convergence
rates in certain homoscedastic settings. We evaluate the finite--sample
performance of our model in extensive simulation studies involving various
types of functional data and traditional Euclidean scenarios. Finally, we
demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through a digital health
application related to physical activity, aiming to provide personalized
recommendations

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the theoretical benefits of rebalancing imbalanced datasets for training Centered Random Forests (CRF), introduces a debiased estimator (IS-ICRF), and proves its advantages in variance reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of imbalanced data in classification tasks, the study explores the theoretical implications of rebalancing datasets for CRF training.

Method: Theoretical analysis of CRF on rebalanced data, including a Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and introduction of a debiased estimator (IS-ICRF) using importance sampling.

Result: The IS-ICRF estimator satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function value and shows variance reduction in high imbalance settings.

Conclusion: Rebalancing datasets for CRF training, followed by debiasing, offers theoretical and practical advantages over using original imbalanced data.

Abstract: Many classification tasks involve imbalanced data, in which a class is
largely underrepresented. Several techniques consists in creating a rebalanced
dataset on which a classifier is trained. In this paper, we study theoretically
such a procedure, when the classifier is a Centered Random Forests (CRF). We
establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the infinite CRF with explicit rates
and exact constant. We then prove that the CRF trained on the rebalanced
dataset exhibits a bias, which can be removed with appropriate techniques.
Based on an importance sampling (IS) approach, the resulting debiased
estimator, called IS-ICRF, satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function
value. For high imbalance settings, we prove that the IS-ICRF estimator enjoys
a variance reduction compared to the ICRF trained on the original data.
Therefore, our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of training random
forests on a rebalanced dataset (followed by a debiasing procedure) compared to
using the original data. Our theoretical results, especially the variance rates
and the variance reduction, appear to be valid for Breiman's random forests in
our experiments.

TL;DR: A flexible, efficient concept drift detection algorithm for label-less settings, outperforming prior methods under computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of concept drift is critical for ML model performance, especially when true labels are delayed or unavailable.

Method: Uses classical statistical process control in a label-less setting and introduces a new drift detection framework.

Result: Empirically shows better statistical power than previous methods and demonstrates promising performance in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively detects concept drift without labels and integrates well into a broader drift detection framework.

Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in
almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial
for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept
drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on
concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels
of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions.
Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive
models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where
the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We
propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses
classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately
detect concept drifts. We shown empirically that under computational
constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known
methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new drift detection framework to model the
scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show
our how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this
framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering students often lack foundational AI knowledge and awareness of its societal implications early in their academic journey. This course aims to address this gap.

Method: The course was divided into three interdisciplinary modules (planetary, societal impact, workplace) co-delivered by faculty from engineering and humanities, focusing on AI's broad implications without heavy mathematics.

Result: Students showed improved comprehension of AI challenges, including awareness of environmental impact and solutions for fairness, and evolved perceptions of AI's transformative role.

Conclusion: The interdisciplinary design effectively bridged the knowledge gap, enhancing students' understanding and appreciation of AI's societal and technical dimensions.

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for
first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure
to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering
students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal
implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to
address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can
a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any
domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans
mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our
lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from
both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role
as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental
challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around
privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job
displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this
course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical
approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results
revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse
metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)
efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated
the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our

performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to
validate the feature selection approach.

### [422] [SPBA: Utilizing Speech Large Language Model for Backdoor Attacks on Speech Classification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08346)
*Wenhan Yao,Fen Xiao,Xiarun Chen,Jia Liu,YongQiang He,Weiping Wen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new speech backdoor attack method (SPBA) using diverse triggers like timbre and emotion, leveraging SLLM, and mitigates challenges with MGDA, showing high effectiveness in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in speech classification are limited by trigger constraints; the paper aims to enhance attack diversity and effectiveness.

Method: Uses Speech Large Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers (timbre, emotion) and employs Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) for mitigation.

Result: SPBA demonstrates significant trigger effectiveness and superior performance in attack metrics on speech classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SPBA method effectively enhances backdoor attack diversity and success, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker
verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently,
the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and
speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to
become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited
number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In
this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on
speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large
Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of
triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher
attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple
Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this
challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack
(SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two
speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger
effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

*Franck Meyer,Kyunghoon Hur,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MD-ViSCo is a unified framework for generating any target vital sign waveform from any single input waveform using a single model, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models require distinct architectures for each source-to-target pair, hindering clinical usability. MD-ViSCo aims to unify this process.

Method: Uses a shallow 1-D U-Net with Swin Transformer and AdaIN to capture waveform styles, evaluated on public datasets.

Result: Reduces MAE by 8.8% and improves PC by 4.9%, meeting AAMI and BHS standards for ABP waveforms.

Conclusion: MD-ViSCo provides a versatile, single-model solution for vital sign waveform generation in healthcare.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target
vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are
designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires
distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing
pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical
settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional
Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any
target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or
arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single
model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin
Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture
distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct
multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our
framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average
across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and
improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the
generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British
Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By
eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe
that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital
sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

TL;DR: Step-Audio-AQAA is an end-to-end LALM for Audio Query-Audio Answer tasks, integrating a dual-codebook tokenizer, a large LLM, and a vocoder. It outperforms state-of-the-art models in speech control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LALMs rely on text outputs, limiting natural speech generation for seamless audio interactions.

Method: Uses a dual-codebook audio tokenizer, a 130B-parameter LLM, and a neural vocoder. Post-training involves interleaved token-output and DPO with model merge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LALMs on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark, especially in speech control.

Conclusion: Step-Audio-AQAA offers a promising solution for end-to-end LALMs, emphasizing the importance of token-based vocoders for AQAA tasks.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits
their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless
audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully
end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model
integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature
extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for
high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved
token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance.
Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that
Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the
state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for
end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in
enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.

TL;DR: ACORN teaches LLMs physical awareness using sound, leveraging a physics-based simulator to generate training data and demonstrating effectiveness in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack physical awareness, limiting their understanding of real-world phenomena. ACORN aims to bridge this gap by teaching LLMs through sound.

Method: ACORN uses a physics-based simulator to generate diverse training data (AQA-PHY dataset) and an audio encoder processing magnitude and phase information, connected to LLMs.

Result: ACORN achieves reasonable performance in tasks like line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation.

Conclusion: ACORN successfully enhances LLMs' physical awareness, paving the way for broader applications in understanding the physical world.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and
multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical
awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as
line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival
estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

*Or Tal,Felix Kreuk,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A comparative study of Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching in text-to-music generation, focusing on modeling paradigms to isolate their effects on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating diverse SOTA text-to-music models fairly and identifying the impact of modeling paradigms on performance.

Method: Controlled comparison of Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar architectures.

Result: Reveals distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, including generation quality, robustness, scalability, and editing capabilities.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for future text-to-music generation systems, guiding architectural and training decisions.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

TL;DR: The paper introduces Astro-DSB, a variant of Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge models, for dynamical astrophysical systems, showing improved interpretability and performance in star formation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address observational inverse prediction tasks in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation, leveraging diffusion models beyond traditional applications.

Method: Proposes Astro-DSB, a paired DSB variant tailored for astrophysical dynamics, tested on simulated and real data (Taurus B213).

Result: Astro-DSB outperforms conventional methods in interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction, especially in OOD cases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of physics-aware generative models, expanding diffusion models' applications beyond visual synthesis.

Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of
dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse
prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We
introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain
assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning
process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in
real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First,
from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves
interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over
conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from
the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals
improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and
different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into
diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and
provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data
statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can
align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

Result: Demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval performance in both in-domain and cross-database retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of multimodal foundation models for structure-function understanding in protein biology.

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics
from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of
protein structures derived by structural determination methods like
cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning

For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval
performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for

TL;DR: MasHost is an RL-based framework for autonomous Multi-agent system (Mas) design, introducing component rationality and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mas construction methods rely on manual or heuristic rules, limiting autonomy and introducing biases.

Method: Formulates Mas construction as a graph search problem, using probabilistic sampling and Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO).

Result: Outperforms baselines in experiments across six benchmarks, showing effectiveness, efficiency, and rationality.

Conclusion: MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

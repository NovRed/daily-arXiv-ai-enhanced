Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly\nenhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional\nsemantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale\nannotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect\ndetection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic\nsegmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class\nactivation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of\nexisting CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient\ndetail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),\nwhich refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas\nwith higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a\nregion-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,\npseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance\niteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively\nbridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect\nsegmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework for surface defect detection, using region-aware CAM and pseudo-label training, outperforms existing methods.", "motivation": "Addressing the reliance on large annotated datasets in defect detection by proposing a weakly supervised approach.", "method": "Combines filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP) for refined target regions and a region-aware weighted module for spatial precision, followed by pseudo-label training.", "result": "Superior performance on industrial defect datasets, bridging weakly supervised learning and high-precision segmentation.", "conclusion": "The framework offers a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial defect detection."}}

Evaluations of \"culture\" are showing the myriad\nways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging\nout rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this\nphenomenon \"softmaxing culture,\" and it is one of the fundamental challenges\nfacing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of\nculture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.\nThis position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key\nshifts. First, instead of asking \"what is culture?\" at the start of system\nevaluations, I propose beginning with the question: \"when is culture?\" Second,\nwhile I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the\nchallenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to\ntheir particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation\napproaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more\nresponsive to the complexities of culture.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI models homogenize culture, termed 'softmaxing culture.'

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive\nexperiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,\nsignificantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including\nResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,\nwith Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy\non ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%.

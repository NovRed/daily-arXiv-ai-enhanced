### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an alternative to Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 2.2x faster training convergence while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatmap regression methods for facial landmark detection use Soft-argmax as a differentiable approximation for argmax, but this may not be the optimal approach. The authors revisit this long-standing choice to explore better alternatives.

Method: The authors propose an alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework instead of using Soft-argmax for differentiable approximation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Soft-argmax is not the only way to achieve strong performance in facial landmark detection, and structured prediction-based approaches can provide superior training efficiency and competitive results.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel integration of Graph Convolutional Networks with Voronoi diagrams for enhanced image classification by representing images as graphs and refining them with Delaunay triangulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional CNNs by leveraging GCNs' ability to model relational data structures and Voronoi diagrams' spatial partitioning capabilities for more effective image representation.

Method: Represent images as graphs with pixels/regions as vertices, refine graphs using Delaunay triangulations, and integrate GCNs with Voronoi diagram-based spatial modeling.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in complex scenes and fine-grained categories.

Conclusion: The combination of GCNs with Voronoi diagrams provides an effective framework for advancing image classification and expands graph-based learning applications in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO is a single-stage RGB-only framework that unifies object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without depth data or CAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage pipelines. There's a need for a simpler, RGB-only solution that learns directly at category level without additional data.

Method: Single-stage query-based transformer framework with lightweight pose head, bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. Trained end-to-end with only RGB images and category-level pose labels.

Result: Sets new SOTA on three benchmarks. On REAL275: 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under 10Â°10cm metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing gap to RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: YOPO demonstrates that object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be unified with high performance using only RGB images, providing a simpler yet effective alternative to complex multi-stage approaches.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks using paired-sampling contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional face recognition systems use separate models for physical and digital spoofing detection, increasing complexity, latency, and vulnerability to combined attacks. A unified approach is needed.

Method: Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that uses automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues through contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 2.10% average classification error rate (ACER) on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark, outperforming prior solutions. Framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively detects both physical and digital face spoofing attacks with superior performance, low computational requirements, and practical deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen is a training-free black-box adversarial attack method that uses diffusion models with only 3-20 sampling steps to generate high-quality adversarial images efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images and require substantial computational resources, while diffusion models need hundreds of steps for adversarial generation.

Method: TAIGen injects perturbations during the mixing step interval without processing all timesteps, using a selective RGB channel strategy with attention maps on red channel and GradCAM-guided perturbations on green/blue channels.

Result: TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet on ImageNet, with PSNR above 30 dB and 10x faster generation than existing diffusion-based attacks.

Conclusion: TAIGen is the most impactful attack method as it achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating defense mechanisms are least successful in purifying its generated images.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ is a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement that addresses concealed visual perception by combining reversible modeling across mask and RGB domains with targeted diffusion-based refinement of uncertain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods are limited to mask domain reversible strategies, leaving RGB domain potential unexplored. The paper aims to develop a more comprehensive approach that handles uncertainty across both domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage deep network that unfolds an optimization solution, integrating three modules: CORE for mask domain reversible modeling, CARE for RGB domain reversible modeling, and FINE with targeted Bernoulli diffusion for refining uncertain regions only.

Result: RUN++ efficiently directs focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly reducing false positives and negatives while avoiding prohibitive computational costs of full-image diffusion processes.

Conclusion: The method introduces a new paradigm for robust CVP systems that work under real-world degradations and establishes a broader bi-level optimization framework, successfully combining reversible modeling with targeted generative refinement.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow introduces curvature-aware flow matching to improve text-to-image generation by learning non-linear trajectories that better follow semantic instructions compared to linear rectified flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear trajectories in rectified flow models force generation through low-probability regions, potentially harming semantic alignment between generated images and text captions. The relationship between trajectory curvature and instructional compliance remains underexplored.

Method: A flow matching framework with curvature regularization that penalizes abrupt changes in trajectory dynamics, enabling learning of smooth non-linear paths between data and noise distributions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MS COCO 2014/2017, significantly outperforming standard rectified flow and non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion, with notable improvements in semantic consistency metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CLAIR).

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while maintaining high image quality, demonstrating the importance of non-linear trajectories for semantic alignment in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA is a self-supervised NR-IQA framework that uses hierarchical ranking and quality alignment to predict image quality without reference images or subjective labels, achieving SOTA performance with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NR-IQA methods suffer from dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels, limiting their generalization capabilities. There's a need for a framework that can predict image quality without pristine references or auxiliary modalities.

Method: Combines ranking and contrastive learning with: 1) Higher-order ranking loss for relational ordering across distortion pairs, 2) Embedding distance loss for feature-perception consistency, 3) Contrastive alignment loss guided by textual prompts. Also introduces HiRQA-S lightweight variant for real-time deployment.

Result: HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations (lens flare, haze, motion blur, low-light) despite being trained only on synthetic distortions. HiRQA-S achieves 3.5 ms inference time per image. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and authentic benchmarks.

Conclusion: HiRQA provides a scalable, self-supervised solution for NR-IQA that overcomes dataset bias issues and demonstrates strong generalization without requiring reference images or subjective labels during inference.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments with spatiotemporally correlated disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications in emergency response and tactical scenarios require near-real-time performance in dynamic edge environments, but face reliability issues from spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy using genetic algorithm optimization to solve the camera selection problem against spatiotemporal disruptions.

Result: Demonstrates benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction compared to traditional baseline strategies using publicly available and customized 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology ensures reconstruction quality satisfaction even when cameras experience spatiotemporally correlated disruptions, providing reliable performance in dynamic edge environments.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XDR-LVLM is a novel framework that combines Vision-Language Large Models for accurate diabetic retinopathy diagnosis with natural language explanations, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable diagnostic reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparency and interpretability in deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy detection, which hinders clinical adoption despite their promising performance.

Method: Leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) with specialized Medical Vision Encoder, LVLM Core, Multi-task Prompt Engineering, and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to understand pathological features in fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 84.55% Balanced Accuracy and 79.92% F1 Score for disease diagnosis, plus 77.95% BACC and 66.88% F1 for concept detection. Human evaluations confirm high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of explanations.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully bridges the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing both accurate DR detection and interpretable natural language explanations, making it suitable for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

### [12] [MeSS: City Mesh-Guided Outdoor Scene Generation with Cross-View Consistent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15169)
*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,RÃ¼diger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeSS generates high-quality, style-consistent outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric prior, combining image diffusion models with 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: City mesh models lack realistic textures, limiting their use in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. Existing diffusion models struggle with 3D scene generation and cross-view consistency.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets, 2) Propagate denser views via AGInpaint, 3) Eliminate visual inconsistencies with GCAlign module. Concurrent 3DGS reconstruction on mesh surface.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Enables diverse style rendering through relighting and style transfer.

Conclusion: MeSS successfully addresses texture generation for city mesh models, producing high-quality, consistent 3D scenes suitable for virtual navigation and autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, proper modeling of rule-based surrounding agents is crucial, as existing approaches train agents to learn optimal behavior with rule-based agents but may not account for adversarial scenarios.

Method: A learning-based method is presented to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents, specifically targeting failure scenarios. The approach is evaluated against various rule-based agents and IDM models.

Result: The adversarial agent successfully causes failure scenarios, as evidenced by a decrease in cumulative reward when evaluated against all rule-based agents.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based adversarial method effectively identifies and exploits weaknesses in rule-based agent models, highlighting the importance of robust modeling in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

*Leiyue Zhao,Yuechen Yang,Yanfan Zhu,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo,Paul D. Simonson,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyMorph-B2I is a dynamic morphology-guided pipeline that converts binary semantic masks to instance-level segmentation for renal pathology analysis, outperforming traditional methods through integrated watershed, skeletonization, and adaptive geometric refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing renal pathology datasets and methods only provide binary semantic masks, limiting precision for morphological quantification of functional units. Classical post-processing techniques individually fail to handle the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity in renal tissue.

Method: Integrated watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework with adaptive geometric refinement and class-specific hyperparameter tuning. Uses systematic parameter optimization to separate adherent and heterogeneous structures.

Result: Outperforms individual classical approaches and naive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I provides a robust solution for converting binary masks to instance-level segmentation, addressing the limitations of traditional methods for renal pathology analysis. The pipeline is publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGNet model improves accident prediction from dash-cam videos using better spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks, outperforming previous methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective accident prediction system using only dash-cam video input, which is more challenging but more deployable than sensor-based systems.

Method: Incorporates improved spatio-temporal features and aggregates them through a recurrent network to enhance graph neural networks for accident prediction.

Result: Achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods across three publicly available datasets, including cross-validation and cross-dataset testing.

Conclusion: The proposed STAGNet model provides superior performance for accident prediction using only dash-cam video, offering a practical and cost-effective solution for road safety applications.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

### [16] [Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15228)
*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM is the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that leverages multiple modalities (RGB, RGBD, point clouds) for superior 3D asset generation with enhanced textures and geometric details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models either operate in single-modality paradigms, missing complementary benefits of multi-modal data, or are restricted to 3D structures limiting available training datasets. Multi-modal data provides distinct advantages - RGB images contain vivid textures while point clouds define fine-grained geometries.

Method: 1) Collaborative multi-modal coding that integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique strengths. 2) Auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision to improve robustness and performance. 3) Triplane latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D assets from embedded multi-modal codes.

Result: Extensive experiments show TriMM achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets despite using small training data. Additional experiments verify feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets like RGB-D into 3D generation.

Conclusion: TriMM successfully harnesses multi-modal data for 3D modeling, demonstrating that effectively leveraging complementary modalities enables superior 3D asset generation with both enhanced textures and geometric details, even with limited training data.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

### [17] [Center-Oriented Prototype Contrastive Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15231)
*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework with soft prototype contrast and dual consistency learning to address class conflict and prototype drift issues in contrastive clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering suffer from class conflict problems and prototype deviation issues, where hard prototypes don't accurately represent true cluster centers.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) Soft prototype contrastive module that uses sample-to-center probability as weights to calculate category prototypes, 2) Dual consistency learning module that aligns different transformations of samples and neighborhoods to ensure transformation invariance and compact intra-cluster distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework effectively addresses class conflict and prototype drift problems, providing more accurate clustering performance.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN) task uses two UAVs at different altitudes - high-altitude for environmental reasoning and low-altitude for precise navigation, with a new dataset HaL-13k and AeroDuo framework for collaborative vision-language navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV vision-language navigation faces challenges with extended trajectories and complex maneuverability, requiring human intervention or overly detailed instructions. The goal is to leverage UAVs' high mobility for multi-grained perspectives while maintaining manageable motion space.

Method: Proposed DuAl-VLN task with two UAVs: high-altitude UAV uses multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, low-altitude UAV employs lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding. They exchange minimal coordinate information for efficiency.

Result: Created HaL-13k dataset with 13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories with target-oriented language instructions, including unseen maps and unseen object validation sets for systematic generalization evaluation.

Conclusion: The dual-UAV collaborative approach enables reliable outdoor navigation by combining high-altitude environmental reasoning with low-altitude precise navigation, addressing the challenges of extended UAV trajectories while maintaining efficiency through minimal information exchange.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

### [19] [Pretrained Diffusion Models Are Inherently Skipped-Step Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15233)
*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skipped-step sampling enables faster diffusion model generation by bypassing intermediate steps while maintaining quality, showing this acceleration is an intrinsic property of pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require sequential step-by-step generation which is computationally expensive. Existing methods like DDIM use non-Markovian processes, but it's unclear if the original diffusion process can achieve similar efficiency.

Method: Proposed skipped-step sampling that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, derived from the same training objective as standard diffusion models. Also integrated with DDIM for enhanced generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models show high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Conclusion: Accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, enabling efficient Markovian generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

TL;DR: Comp-X is the first LLM-powered interactive image compression system that intelligently handles various coding modes through natural language interaction, overcoming limitations of traditional manual mode selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs have limited coding modes and require manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for non-professional users. There's a need for more intelligent and interactive compression systems.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Multi-functional coding framework unifying various coding modes, 2) Interactive coding agent using augmented in-context learning with expert feedback, 3) IIC-bench benchmark for evaluation with diverse user requests and expert annotations.

Result: Comp-X efficiently understands coding requests and achieves impressive textual interaction capability while maintaining comparable compression performance with a single framework.

Conclusion: The system provides a promising avenue for applying artificial general intelligence (AGI) to image compression, enabling intelligent interaction and versatile coding capabilities.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

*Han Li,Shaofei Huang,Longfei Xu,Yulu Gao,Beipeng Mu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RATopo introduces a redundancy assignment strategy for lane topology reasoning that enables one-to-many supervision, improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use first-detect-then-reason paradigm with one-to-one assignment, resulting in suboptimal topology reasoning due to limited supervision range.

Method: Restructures Transformer decoder by swapping cross-attention and self-attention layers to retain redundant predictions before suppression, enabling one-to-many assignment. Uses multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters to enhance lane detection diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 show consistent improvements in both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance. The strategy is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing frameworks.

Conclusion: RATopo's redundancy assignment strategy provides quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision, significantly enhancing lane topology reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

TL;DR: DesignCLIP leverages CLIP models for design patent analysis, addressing limitations of traditional image-based methods by incorporating class-aware classification, contrastive learning, and multimodal approaches to improve patent classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional design patent analysis relies heavily on patent images (sketches) which often lack comprehensive visual context and semantic information, leading to ambiguities in prior art searches. Recent vision-language models like CLIP offer opportunities for more reliable AI-driven patent analysis.

Method: Developed DesignCLIP framework using CLIP models with class-aware classification and contrastive learning. Utilized generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. Built on a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents.

Result: DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models in patent classification and retrieval tasks. Also enables multimodal patent retrieval for enhanced creativity and innovation in design.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches show significant promise in advancing patent analysis, with DesignCLIP demonstrating superior performance across various downstream tasks in the patent domain.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA is a novel framework for fetal congenital heart defect classification in ultrasound videos that combines temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods for CHD detection in ultrasound videos neglect temporal information, limit to binary classification, and lack prediction calibration, which hinders clinical reliability.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) extracts frame features using image encoder, aggregates with temporal extractor, aligns with class-specific text prompts via contrastive loss, and uses CVAESM module for uncertainty quantification and style modulation.

Result: TPA achieves 85.40% macro F1 score for CHD diagnosis, reduces calibration error by 5.38-6.8%, and boosts macro F1 by 4.73% on EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task.

Conclusion: TPA effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating temporal modeling, prompt learning, and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating superior performance and clinical reliability for CHD detection in ultrasound videos.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR: First multimodal dataset combining LiDAR point clouds with multi-view camera footage for basketball player tracking, enabling real-time 3D MOT with improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-camera systems struggle with real-time 3D player tracking due to 2D video limitations and complex reconstruction. Basketball presents extreme MOT challenges with rapid player movements, frequent occlusions, and physical contact in confined spaces.

Method: Constructed BasketLiDAR dataset with 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs from professional basketball games. Developed novel MOT algorithm using LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information with two pipelines: real-time LiDAR-only tracking and multimodal LiDAR-camera fusion.

Result: Achieved real-time operation (previously difficult with camera-only methods) and superior tracking performance even under occlusion conditions. Dataset contains synchronized data from 3 LiDAR sensors and 3 multi-view cameras.

Conclusion: The multimodal LiDAR-camera approach successfully addresses basketball tracking challenges, providing accurate real-time 3D player tracking with reduced computational requirements compared to traditional camera-based systems.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camouflaged object detection is challenging due to object-background similarity. Existing methods require heavy training and computational resources, while foundation models like SAM need high-quality prompts that are costly to generate manually.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) creates coarse masks as prompts via unsupervised clustering and feature retrieval, 2) SAM-based segmentation (SEG) refines the masks using the generated prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show RAG-SEG performs on par or better than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark COD datasets, with all experiments conducted on a personal laptop.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG provides an efficient, training-free paradigm for COD that maintains competitive performance while being computationally practical and eliminating the need for conventional training.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser is a training-free framework that prevents text-to-video diffusion models from generating harmful or unauthorized content by using selective prompt embedding adjustment and adversarial-resilient noise guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-video diffusion models by preventing generation of harmful, misleading, or unauthorized content that may include personal identities, artistic creations, or explicit materials.

Method: Two-stage plug-and-play framework: 1) Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and 2) Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). Works without additional training and integrates seamlessly with existing T2V diffusion models.

Result: Achieves 46% average reduction in undesirable content generation across four tasks (object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, explicit content erasure), outperforming prior methods in efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability.

Conclusion: VideoEraser provides an effective training-free solution for content safety in T2V generation, setting state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable concepts while maintaining video quality and robustness against adversarial prompts.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need to predict pedestrian crossing intentions from a distance for safe navigation, requiring advanced AI systems to understand human behavior.

Method: Combined pose detection models with sequence modeling techniques (GRU, LSTM, 1D CNN) for temporal predictions, creating an end-to-end deep learning framework using video analysis.

Result: GRU performed better than LSTM for intent prediction accuracy, while 1D CNN was the fastest model in terms of processing speed.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed a deep learning framework that can predict pedestrian road crossing intentions, with different sequence models offering trade-offs between accuracy and speed for autonomous vehicle applications.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.

person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic empirical study using attention knockouts to understand how Video-LLMs internally process video content, revealing key insights about layer functionality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Video-LLM research focuses on performance improvement rather than understanding internal mechanisms, creating a gap in interpretability that this study aims to address.

Method: The authors use attention knockouts as the primary analytical tool with three variants (Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, Language-to-Video Knockout) applied across different layer windows in both global and fine-grained settings.

Result: Key findings include: (1) Video information extraction occurs primarily in early layers in a two-stage process, (2) Certain intermediate layers have outsized impact while most contribute minimally, (3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than expensive self-attention among video tokens.

Conclusion: The study provides the first systematic understanding of Video-LLM internal processing, offering both interpretability insights and demonstrating how these findings can be leveraged to reduce attention computation for improved efficiency.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune is an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes specific layers rather than all parameters, improving efficiency and reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning methods update all model parameters, which can lead to overfitting and high computational demands. There's a need for more efficient transfer learning approaches that optimize performance while reducing resource requirements.

Method: Uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify and selectively fine-tune only the most relevant layers for a given target task, rather than updating all model parameters.

Result: Evaluation across nine image classification datasets shows BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like AutoRGN and LoRA, while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: BioTune provides an effective approach for efficient transfer learning by focusing fine-tuning on relevant layers, reducing computational costs and facilitating better adaptation across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer is a novel compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves kilobyte-range compression while enabling adaptability to scene changes after archival through image-conditioned decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods only achieve megabyte-range compression which is impractical for large-scale scenes and lack mechanisms to handle scene changes after long-term archival.

Method: Proposes Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer that jointly exploits inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations, uses shared codebooks across scenes, and enables conditional decoding based on images captured at decoding time.

Result: Reduces 3DGS storage requirements to kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer provides a practical solution for archival of 3DGS scenes with superior compression efficiency and post-archival adaptability capabilities.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

*Cong Wang,Xianda Guo,Wenbo Xu,Wei Tian,Ruiqi Song,Chenming Zhang,Lingxi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat is a novel 3D scene reconstruction method for driving scenarios that improves upon existing Gaussian splatting techniques by introducing region-wise voxel initialization, deformable neural Gaussians for dynamic objects, and geometric supervision from depth/normal priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods for driving scenes overlook background optimization with proper geometry relationships and rely too heavily on fitting individual training views, resulting in limited robustness for novel view rendering and inaccurate geometric representations.

Method: The method uses region-wise voxel initialization (near/middle/far regions) to enhance close-range details, introduces deformable neural Gaussians with learnable deformation networks for non-rigid dynamic actors, and employs depth and normal priors from pre-trained models for geometric supervision.

Result: DriveSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios, as demonstrated through rigorous evaluation on Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios by combining optimized static background representation with accurate dynamic object modeling through neural Gaussian representations and geometric priors.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the abstract reasoning bottleneck in deep learning by focusing on Raven's Progressive Matrices problems, proposing causal chain modeling and improving baseline models to better capture human reasoning logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models lack strong abstract reasoning capabilities, and RPM problems serve as an authoritative benchmark to evaluate and enhance these abilities in machine intelligence.

Method: Adopts a causal chain modeling perspective to analyze RPM tasks, designs baseline model DIO architecture, and progressively proposes three improvement methods to address limitations in mutual information optimization.

Result: Experiments revealed that the initial optimization objective (maximizing variational lower bound of mutual information) failed to enable genuine acquisition of human reasoning logic due to lower bound tightness issues and statistical nature of mutual information.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to enhancing abstract reasoning in AI by systematically analyzing RPM causal chains and proposing improved methods to better capture causal relationships and human reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with global temporal dependencies, semantic coherence, and noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: Combines SNN-based keyframe extractor with Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner and Variational Inference Reconstruction Module using ELBO optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS datasets with enhanced information density and reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: SpiVG effectively addresses key challenges in video summarization through spiking neural networks and variational inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn spatial correlations in images and provides theoretical insights for hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAEs require extensive hyperparameter tuning for new datasets, but the connection between these hyperparameters and downstream performance remains poorly understood, especially regarding spatial correlation learning.

Method: The authors analytically derive features learned by linear MAEs and extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs, examining how masking ratio and patch size affect the learning of spatial correlations at different ranges.

Result: The research shows that MAE hyperparameters (masking ratio and patch size) can selectively capture short- and long-range spatial correlations, and that MAE representations adapt to spatial correlations beyond second-order statistics.

Conclusion: The work provides practical insights for selecting MAE hyperparameters based on the spatial correlation properties of target datasets, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIRD is a bidirectional temporal information propagation method for infrared small target detection that simultaneously utilizes local temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal information from past/future frames in a recursive fashion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based multi-frame methods use sliding window approaches that ignore global temporal information outside the window, resulting in redundant computation and sub-optimal performance. They don't consider joint optimization of entire video clips.

Method: Proposes BIRD with bidirectional propagation strategy. Uses Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal dependency between target frame and adjacent frames, and Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module to aggregate global propagation feature with local fusion feature. Joint optimization with detection loss and Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows fast inference speed.

Conclusion: The bidirectional temporal information propagation method effectively addresses limitations of sliding-window approaches by leveraging both local and global temporal information, resulting in superior detection performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

TL;DR: YOLOv8-based deep learning system for detecting microscopic car surface dents with high accuracy and real-time performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional car damage inspection is manual, time-consuming, and unreliable for detecting tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents, requiring automated solutions

Method: Used YOLOv8 object detection framework with custom variants (YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42) trained on annotated dataset of car surfaces under various conditions with real-time data augmentation

Result: YOLOv8m-t42 achieved precision 0.86, recall 0.84, F1-score 0.85, mAP@0.5 of 0.60, and PR curve area of 0.88, outperforming other variants

Conclusion: The deep learning approach provides accurate real-time detection of microscopic car surface defects, suitable for automated insurance assessments and vehicle inspections

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR is a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval that uses dual-stage sequence alignment and self-supervised pre-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet-VRL and SportsMoments datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-to-video moment retrieval requires semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: MATR uses transformer architecture with dual-stage sequence alignment to condition target video representations on query features, plus self-supervised pre-training by localizing random clips within videos.

Result: Achieves 13.1% R@1 and 8.1% mIoU improvement on ActivityNet-VRL, and 14.7% R@1 and 14.4% mIoU gain on SportsMoments dataset over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MATR effectively addresses video-to-video moment retrieval challenges through transformer-based alignment and self-supervised pre-training, demonstrating significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: A novel SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse inputs (as few as 2 views), achieving state-of-the-art performance with 2.75dB PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires dense multi-view inputs with precise camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. SfM initialization fails with extremely sparse views, leading to degraded rendering quality.

Method: Proposes dense stereo module for camera pose estimation and global dense point cloud initialization, coherent view interpolation for additional supervision, and multi-scale regularization techniques for enhanced geometry and rendering quality.

Result: Achieves 2.75dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods under extremely sparse-view conditions (2 training views), with minimal distortion and preserved high-frequency details.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the limitations of 3DGS in sparse-view scenarios by eliminating SfM dependency and introducing novel modules for pose estimation, view interpolation, and regularization, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for lightweight, generalizable medical image segmentation models in resource-constrained clinical settings, overcoming limitations of existing lightweight models that compromise performance and lack global contextual perception capabilities.

Method: Proposes LGMSNet framework with heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while reducing channel redundancy, and integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information.

Result: Extensive experiments across six public datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: LGMSNet shows strong potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios, offering high performance with minimal computational requirements and excellent generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

TL;DR: Study evaluates YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN face detectors across different resolutions, finding YOLOv11 has best accuracy at higher resolutions while YOLOv12 has better recall. MTCNN is slower for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery degrade face detection performance, requiring systematic investigation of resolution impact on modern deep learning detectors.

Method: Used WIDER FACE dataset to evaluate three models (YOLOv11, YOLOv12, MTCNN) across multiple resolutions (160x160, 320x320, 640x640) with precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time metrics.

Result: YOLOv11 outperformed others in detection accuracy especially at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 had slightly better recall, MTCNN was competitive in landmark localization but slower for real-time inference.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models suitable for varying operational constraints, with YOLOv11 recommended for high-accuracy scenarios.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MExECON is a multi-view 3D reconstruction pipeline for clothed human avatars that extends the single-view ECON method, using joint multi-view body optimization and normal map integration to improve geometry and surface details without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-view reconstruction by leveraging multiple viewpoints for better geometry estimation, body pose accuracy, and fine-grained surface detail capture in clothed human avatars.

Method: Uses Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) to fit a single SMPL-X body model across all views with multi-view consistency, then integrates normal maps from front and back views to add geometric details through surface reconstruction.

Result: Consistently improves fidelity over single-view baseline and achieves competitive performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods, capturing fine details like clothing folds and hairstyles.

Conclusion: MExECON successfully extends single-view reconstruction to multi-view scenarios without network retraining, demonstrating effective multi-view consistency enforcement and detailed surface reconstruction for clothed human avatars.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse is a novel multimodal image fusion framework that uses adaptive wavelet transform and spatial-frequency mamba blocks to achieve superior fusion performance across multiple tasks with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal image fusion methods face challenges including modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations that need to be addressed for better integration of complementary information from different imaging modalities.

Method: Proposes AdaSFFuse framework with two key innovations: Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling and alignment, and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks (Infrared-Visible, Multi-Focus, Multi-Exposure, and Medical Image Fusion) demonstrate superior fusion performance with low computational cost and compact network architecture.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse effectively addresses MMIF challenges by improving multimodal feature alignment, reducing frequency loss, and preserving critical details while maintaining computational efficiency across diverse fusion tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for synthesizing extrapolated driving views from recorded logs suffer from poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings when using generative priors as pseudo ground truth.

Method: Proposes ExtraGS framework with Road Surface Gaussian (RSG) representation using hybrid Gaussian-SDF design, Far Field Gaussians (FFG) with learnable scaling factors, and self-supervised uncertainty estimation based on spherical harmonics for selective generative prior integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ExtraGS significantly enhances realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views while preserving high fidelity along original trajectory across multiple datasets and camera setups.

Conclusion: ExtraGS provides a holistic solution for trajectory extrapolation that effectively integrates geometric and generative priors to overcome limitations of previous methods in driving scene simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch is a two-stage method for vector sketch animation that handles multi-object interactions through semantic grouping and a Group-based Displacement Network to generate temporally consistent animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch animation methods struggle with multi-object interactions and complex motions, suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Motion Initialization - interactively divide sketch into semantic groups and define key frames for coarse interpolation, 2) Motion Refinement - Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) with Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement to refine animation using text-to-video model priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show GroupSketch significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex multi-object sketches.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches and expands practical applications of sketch animation by handling multi-object interactions and complex motions with improved consistency.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet is a novel network for extracting narrow roads from remote sensing imagery using dilated dual-stream differential attention fusion to handle fragmented, occluded roads with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to limited width, fragmented topology, and frequent occlusions that conventional models struggle with.

Method: Proposes D3FNet with three innovations: 1) Differential Attention Dilation Extraction module for enhanced road features, 2) Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism for spatial-semantic balance, 3) Multi-scale dilation strategy to reduce artifacts.

Result: Achieves superior IoU and recall on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on challenging road regions.

Conclusion: D3FNet is a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road extraction in complex remote perception scenarios, with ablation studies confirming the synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT is a test-time adaptation method that uses Gaussian probabilistic inference with class-conditional likelihood modeling, eliminating backpropagation and enabling closed-form, training-free adaptation with CLIP guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, limiting scalability and real-time deployment. They also lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions, which is crucial for reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions.

Method: Reframes TTA as Gaussian probabilistic inference by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and shared covariance matrix. Uses lightweight regularization with CLIP priors and historical knowledge bank to correct potential likelihood bias. Requires no source data, gradient updates, or full target data access.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks under various distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ADAPT provides an effective backpropagation-free solution for test-time adaptation that models class-conditional distributions explicitly, enabling reliable performance in both online and transductive settings without requiring source data or gradient computations.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

TL;DR: A two-stage training strategy using neighbor-aware soft masks to address spectral bias in Implicit Neural Representations by adaptively weighting pixels with strong local variations to improve high-frequency detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations struggle with spectral bias, favoring low-frequency components and missing high-frequency details like sharp edges and fine textures. Existing solutions focus on architectural changes, but this paper proposes a training-based approach.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) neighbor-aware soft mask adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations to focus on fine details early, 2) transitions to full-image training.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in reconstruction quality and compatibility with existing INR methods.

Conclusion: This work pioneers frequency-aware pixel importance assignment in image INR, offering a new avenue for mitigating spectral bias beyond architectural modifications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel linear time convex relaxation and contractor method for point cloud registration that achieves provable global optimality in under 0.5 seconds for 100 points with known rotation axis, making it 100x faster than state-of-the-art SDP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TLS-based point cloud registration methods using SDP relaxations are too slow (hundreds of seconds for 100 points), making them impractical despite their robustness to 95% outlier rates.

Method: Proposes a linear time convex relaxation approach combined with a contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound (BnB) optimization for the truncated least squares formulation.

Result: The solver achieves provable global optimality in less than half a second for 100-point 3D registration when rotation axis is known, demonstrating 100x speedup over STRIDE SDP solver for rotation-only TLS problems.

Conclusion: The method provides both formal proof and empirical evidence of global optimality while dramatically improving computational efficiency, though currently limited to problems with known rotation axis rather than full 6DoF registration.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT is a Video LLM that improves temporal perception through diffusion-based encoding, object grounding, and explicit timestamp modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal perception - they encode timestamps implicitly, have weak frame-level continuity, and suffer from language-vision alignment drift with entities of interest.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder for boundary sensitivity and temporal consistency, 2) Object grounded representations to bind query entities to visual evidence, 3) Mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens for explicit timestamp modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating robust grounding capabilities.

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT successfully overcomes limitations in temporal perception for Video LLMs through its three innovative components, enabling fine-grained temporal reasoning and improved entity alignment in video understanding.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Weakly supervised approach for tree instance segmentation in ALS data using human quality ratings to train a rating model that improves segmentation performance by 34% in correctly identified trees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree instance segmentation in airborne laser scanning data is challenging due to data variations and expensive precise labeling requirements for fully supervised methods.

Method: Human operators provide quality ratings on initial segmentation results, which train a rating model to classify segmentation outputs. The segmentation model is then finetuned using feedback from this rating model.

Result: 34% improvement in correctly identified tree instances while significantly reducing non-tree instances. Performance reduced in sparsely forested regions with small trees (<2m) or complex surroundings with shrubs/boulders.

Conclusion: The weakly supervised approach effectively improves tree segmentation while reducing labeling costs, though challenges remain in complex terrain with small trees and confusing features.

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

### [54] [Towards a 3D Transfer-based Black-box Attack via Critical Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15650)
*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFG is a transfer-based black-box attack method for 3D point clouds that improves adversarial transferability by prioritizing corruption of critical features shared across different DNN architectures, while ensuring imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D adversarial attack methods require information about target models, which is challenging to obtain in realistic security scenarios. The paper focuses on transfer-based attacks that don't need any target model information.

Method: Proposes CFG method that computes feature importance to prioritize corruption of critical features likely adopted by diverse architectures. Uses loss function constraints to ensure imperceptibility of adversarial point clouds.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show CFG outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: CFG successfully improves transferability of adversarial point clouds in black-box settings by leveraging critical feature guidance and maintaining imperceptibility constraints.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

*Ziyang Yan,Ruikai Li,Zhiyong Cui,Bohan Li,Han Jiang,Yilong Ren,Aoyong Li,Zhenning Li,Sijia Wen,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapKD is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers multimodal map construction knowledge to a lightweight vision-only student model, achieving significant performance improvements while accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online HD map construction methods rely on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensors, causing computational overhead. There's a need for efficient vision-centric models that maintain performance.

Method: Proposes MapKD with Teacher-Coach-Student paradigm: 1) multimodal teacher with map priors, 2) vision-centric coach with simulated LiDAR to bridge modality gap, 3) lightweight vision student. Uses Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation and Masked Semantic Response Distillation.

Result: +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP improvement on nuScenes dataset while accelerating inference speed compared to baseline vision-only models.

Conclusion: MapKD effectively transfers knowledge from multimodal models to vision-centric students, enabling efficient HD map construction without performance degradation.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

*Franz Hanke,Antonia Bieringer,Olaf Wysocki,Boris Jutzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CM2LoD3 is a novel method for automated LoD3 building model reconstruction using Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis and synthetic data generation for semantic segmentation of facade elements like windows and doors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoD1 and LoD2 building models lack detailed facade elements needed for advanced urban analysis, while traditional LoD3 model generation requires manual modeling which is not scalable for large applications.

Method: Leverages Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis, uses synthetically generated Conflict Maps from Semantic Conflict Map Generator for semantic segmentation, and fuses with textured model segmentation using confidence scores.

Result: Achieves 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures, effectively segments and reconstructs building openings.

Conclusion: The method advances automated LoD3 model reconstruction and enables scalable, efficient 3D city modeling for urban planning, digital twins, and disaster management.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDPR framework addresses class imbalance in VLM fine-tuning by creating multi-dimensional knowledge base and dynamic prompt routing for balanced predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fine-tuning methods suffer from bias in class-imbalanced scenes and overlook inherent class imbalance in pre-training, leading to bias accumulation in downstream tasks.

Method: Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) constructs comprehensive knowledge base across five visual-semantic dimensions, uses dynamic routing to align global classes, retrieve optimal prompts, and balance fine-grained semantics with logits fusion.

Result: Achieves comparable results with SOTA methods on long-tailed benchmarks (CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT), shows effectiveness for tail classes, and incurs minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: MDPR provides a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance conditions.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamMem is a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for efficient long video understanding in MLLMs, achieving SOTA performance without needing questions in advance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long videos due to high memory/computational overhead from KV cache storage. Current visual compression methods require encoding entire contexts first or advance question access, which is impractical for streaming video and multi-turn conversations.

Method: StreamMem encodes video frames in streaming manner, compresses KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining fixed-size KV memory for efficient QA in memory-constrained scenarios.

Result: Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video QA benchmarks shows StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware approaches.

Conclusion: StreamMem provides an efficient solution for streaming video understanding in MLLMs by enabling query-agnostic KV cache compression with fixed memory usage, making long-video processing practical without requiring advance question knowledge.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWeaver is a robust framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions (like depth cues) to enhance temporal consistency and reduce structural drift in extended video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods rely heavily on RGB signals, leading to accumulated errors in object structure and motion over long durations. There's a need for better temporal consistency and reduced drift in long-horizon video generation.

Method: Jointly predicts perceptual conditions and color information from unified representation, leverages depth cues (more resistant to drift) to build memory bank for clearer context, and uses segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups to reduce computational cost.

Result: Extensive experiments on diffusion- and rectified flow-based models demonstrate effectiveness in reducing temporal drift and improving video fidelity. The framework enhances temporal consistency and motion dynamics in long video sequences.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver provides an effective solution for long video generation by integrating RGB and perceptual condition modeling, significantly improving structural consistency and reducing drift while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

TL;DR: All-in-SAM model combines molecular-empowered learning with SAM foundation model to improve nuclei segmentation and classification in computational pathology, reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM show promise for nuclei segmentation but struggle with fine-grained semantic segmentation of specific nuclei subtypes and cells. There's a need to reduce detailed pixel-level annotation requirements while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Method: Full-stack approach with three components: (1) annotation-engaging using molecular-empowered learning to reduce detailed annotations, (2) learning-adapting SAM model with SAM adapter for specific semantics, (3) refinement with Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL) to enhance segmentation accuracy.

Result: Experimental results on both in-house and public datasets show significant improvement in cell classification performance, even with varying annotation quality.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotator workload and extends precise biomedical image analysis accessibility to resource-limited settings, advancing medical diagnostics and pathology image analysis automation.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

TL;DR: Waver is a unified foundation model for high-quality image and video generation that achieves top-3 performance on T2V and I2V leaderboards, supporting text-to-video, image-to-video, and text-to-image generation in a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified high-performance model for both image and video generation that can handle multiple modalities (T2V, I2V, T2I) within a single framework while achieving state-of-the-art quality and motion consistency.

Method: Developed Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for better modality alignment and faster training convergence. Implemented comprehensive data curation pipeline with MLLM-based video quality model for filtering high-quality training samples. Provides detailed training and inference recipes.

Result: Generates 5-10 second videos at native 720p resolution (upscaled to 1080p). Achieves top-3 ranking on both T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial Analysis. Outperforms existing open-source models and matches/surpasses commercial solutions in motion amplitude and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Waver represents a significant advancement in unified image and video generation, providing high-quality results across multiple modalities. The technical contributions and open recipes aim to help the community accelerate progress in video generation technologies.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

TL;DR: ATLAS is a high-fidelity parametric body model that decouples shape and skeleton representation using 600K high-resolution scans, enabling better pose fitting and body customization than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing body models struggle with detailed variations across poses and shapes due to limited training data diversity and problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and external soft tissue.

Method: Learned from 600K high-resolution scans using 240 cameras, explicitly decouples shape and skeleton bases by grounding mesh representation in human skeleton, uses non-linear pose correctives.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses, quantitative evaluations show non-linear pose correctives capture complex poses more effectively than linear models.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained body customization, and independent keypoint fitting by decoupling skeleton and shape representation.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Motivation: Addressing the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: Uses a feature aggregation module integrating local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders, coupled with a position head for simultaneous generation of 3D assets and their spatial positions.

Result: Extensive evaluations confirm efficiency and robust generation abilities, with direct extensibility to multi-image inputs despite single-image training.

Conclusion: SceneGen offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation that could advance practical applications in downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene

novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit introduces a visual autoregressive framework for image editing that uses next-scale prediction with scale-aligned conditioning, achieving better adherence to instructions and faster performance than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from global denoising that entangles edited regions with entire image context, causing unintended modifications and poor adherence to editing instructions. Autoregressive models offer a more causal and compositional alternative.

Method: VAREdit reframes image editing as next-scale prediction using visual autoregressive framework. It generates multi-scale target features conditioned on source image and text instructions. Introduces Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module to inject scale-matched conditioning information into self-attention layers.

Result: Outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Completes 512Ã512 editing in 1.2 seconds (2.2Ã faster than similarly sized UltraEdit).

Conclusion: VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency, providing a superior alternative to diffusion-based approaches for instruction-guided image editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable group inference method that improves diversity and quality of multiple samples by formulating it as a quadratic integer assignment problem with progressive candidate pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent sampling in generative models leads to redundant results when presenting multiple outputs to users, limiting choices and hindering idea exploration.

Method: Formulates group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem (candidate outputs as graph nodes), optimizing sample quality (unary term) and group diversity (binary term) with progressive candidate pruning for efficiency.

Result: Significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms across various tasks including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation.

Conclusion: Enables generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples, providing better user experience for idea exploration.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale is a novel inference paradigm that enables high-resolution visual generation (up to 8k images and 4k videos) without fine-tuning, addressing repetitive pattern issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual diffusion models are limited to low-resolution training due to data and computational constraints, causing repetitive patterns and low-quality output when generating higher-resolution content.

Method: Proposes CineScale inference paradigm with dedicated variants for different video generation architectures, enabling high-resolution T2I, T2V, I2V and V2V synthesis without fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in higher-resolution visual generation, achieving 8k image generation without fine-tuning and 4k video generation with minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CineScale successfully extends the capabilities of pre-trained models for high-resolution visual generation across multiple modalities, overcoming limitations of existing tuning-free methods.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens

### [67] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture that uses Graph Signal Processing as the core computational framework, encoding logical entities as graph signals and processing them through learnable spectral filters for improved logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more mathematically grounded and computationally efficient neuro-symbolic reasoning system by fully integrating spectral graph methods rather than treating them as peripheral components.

Method: Formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral domain using Graph Signal Processing. Encodes logical entities as graph signals, processes them via learnable spectral filters for multi-scale information propagation, and maps them to symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. Includes graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Result: Demonstrates improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic models on benchmark reasoning datasets including ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge.

Conclusion: Graph Signal Processing provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient foundation for building robust and interpretable reasoning systems, offering superior performance compared to conventional neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [68] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework where descriptive and prescriptive aspects of world models co-emerge from goal-directed experiences, using telic states to unify goal-directed learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional separation of state representation and reward function in reinforcement learning by proposing an interdependent co-emergence model based on goal-directed experiences.

Method: Introduces goal-directed (telic) states as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions, using statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features.

Result: Provides a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning that integrates descriptive and prescriptive aspects through telic state representations.

Conclusion: This framework offers a unified account of purposeful behavior across behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions, drawing from Buddhist epistemology to reformulate computational models of intelligence.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang WÃ¶rndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC is a multi-agent framework using three LLM agents and a moderator to generate diverse tourism recommendations that counter popularity bias and surface lesser-visited destinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address popularity bias in tourism recommendations that leads to over-tourism and overlooks lesser-visited locales, while improving diversity and relevance in travel suggestions.

Method: Uses three LLM-based agents (Personalization, Popularity, Sustainability) that generate city suggestions from different perspectives, with a non-LLM moderator that merges and refines proposals through multi-round negotiation while penalizing spurious or repeated responses.

Result: Experiments on European city queries show improved diversity and overall relevance compared to single-agent baseline, successfully surfacing lesser-visited locales that are typically overlooked.

Conclusion: The multi-stakeholder collaborative approach effectively addresses over-tourism and better aligns with user constraints, demonstrating promise for LLM-driven recommender systems.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [70] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel agent-based crowd simulation method using LLMs for dialogue-driven navigation, enabling realistic social interactions and emergent group behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd simulations lack complex social and environmental interactions driven by language, limiting agent-agent and agent-environment interactions to basic steering and goal extrapolation.

Method: Uses LLMs with dialogue system and language-driven navigation, querying agent-centric models conditioned on personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to generate inter-agent dialogue and control navigation based on conversation, personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state.

Result: Validated in complex scenarios showing automatic grouping/ungrouping of agents and information-passing mechanisms within crowds, producing more realistic simulations with emergent group behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework enables agents to make motion decisions based on perceptual inputs and ongoing dialogue, creating more realistic crowd simulations with naturally emerging group behaviors from any environmental setting.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [71] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Increasing reasoning budgets in LLMs worsens confidence calibration, while search-augmented generation dramatically improves accuracy to 89.3%, showing information access is more critical than reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models need robust calibration to avoid overconfidence in question answering, requiring systematic evaluation of how reasoning capabilities and computational budgets affect confidence assessment accuracy.

Method: Used ClimateX dataset and expanded it to human and planetary health domains, evaluating reasoning LLMs' confidence calibration with varying computational budgets and comparing with search-augmented generation approaches.

Result: Reasoning LLMs achieved 48.7% accuracy in expert confidence assessment, but increasing reasoning budgets consistently impaired calibration, causing systematic overconfidence. Search-augmented generation achieved 89.3% accuracy by retrieving relevant evidence.

Conclusion: Information access, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, is the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration in knowledge-intensive tasks, challenging the "test-time scaling" paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA is a lightweight, data-free framework that improves safety in LoRA-adapted LLMs by analyzing weight updates, detecting unsafe layers via spectral sharpness metrics, and pruning them without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA fine-tuning can compromise safety alignment in LLMs, leading to unsafe behaviors in agent planning. Existing safety methods require access to both base and tuned models, which are often unavailable.

Method: Proposes S3LoRA with MAS-SVD for structural analysis of LoRA updates and Spectral Sharpness Index to detect unsafe layers, which are then pruned post-hoc.

Result: Extensive experiments show S3LoRA consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining utility and reducing inference costs across agent planning and language tasks.

Conclusion: S3LoRA provides a practical, scalable solution for safe deployment of LLM-based agents in resource-constrained and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Workforce management as abstract argumentation enables real-time change accommodation and faithful explanations, outperforming manual solutions in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce management requires handling real-time changes and providing explanations to stakeholders, which conventional manual approaches struggle with.

Method: Model workforce management as abstract argumentation framework to accommodate execution-time changes and generate faithful explanations.

Result: User study shows the tool with argumentation-based explanations leads to faster and more accurate problem solving compared to conventional manual solutions.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation provides an effective framework for workforce management that successfully handles dynamic changes and delivers understandable explanations to stakeholders.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOOD is an online method that uses LLMs to infer natural language goals from human interactions in open-universe assistance games, outperforming baselines without explicit goal tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to interpret and act on diverse, undefined human goals and preferences in evolving environments, requiring a framework that can handle unbounded goal spaces.

Method: GOOD prompts LLMs to simulate users with complex intents, using the responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate natural language goals without large datasets.

Result: GOOD outperforms baseline methods without explicit goal tracking in both text-based grocery shopping and simulated household robotics environments, validated by LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The GOOD method enables effective goal inference in open-universe settings with rich representations and uncertainty estimation, demonstrating practical applicability in embodied AI scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurgWound dataset with 697 surgical wound images and 8 clinical attributes, benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis with VQA and report generation tasks, and WoundQwen three-stage learning framework for automated wound analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of public datasets and benchmarks for surgical wound screening, overcome data privacy concerns and high annotation costs, and enable automated surgical wound diagnosis to prevent infections.

Method: Created SurgWound dataset with expert annotations, established benchmark tasks (VQA and report generation), developed WoundQwen three-stage framework using multiple MLLMs for characteristic prediction, diagnosis, and comprehensive report generation.

Result: First open-source surgical wound dataset with diverse wound types, first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, and a working three-stage framework that can analyze wound characteristics and provide patient instructions.

Conclusion: The SurgWound dataset, benchmark, and WoundQwen framework enable automated surgical wound screening, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely interventions, and improved patient outcomes through AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated research content lacks appropriate publication venues due to traditional journals' reluctance to accept AI content and preprint servers' lack of quality control, hindering scientific progress.

Method: Developed a multi-agent architecture platform with API and MCP interfaces that allows both human and AI scientists to submit, review, and iteratively refine research proposals and papers through collaborative processes.

Result: Extensive experiments show aiXiv significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing, proving to be a reliable and robust platform.

Conclusion: aiXiv lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem that accelerates publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research, creating a scalable and extensible environment for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-generated datasets suffer from limited reliability, diversity, and scalability, creating a need for high-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers to strengthen reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) encode seed puzzles into structured logical specifications using SMT, (2) generate scalable variants through systematic variable and constraint randomization, (3) ensure validity via reproduction mechanism.

Result: Created benchmark of 83K+ diverse puzzles. Post-training on PuzzleClone data improved average performance from 14.4 to 56.2 on PuzzleClone testset, and showed consistent improvements up to 12.5 percentage points across 7 logic/math benchmarks.

Conclusion: PuzzleClone provides an effective framework for generating scalable, verifiable reasoning data that substantially enhances LLM performance on mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat is an open-source LLM framework that addresses the challenge of applying large language models to rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis by using synthetic data generation and expert evaluation to create trustworthy and empathetic AI support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with rare medical conditions due to scarce and unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis affects 2-3% of the population but lacks tailored AI support, impacting both physical comfort and psychosocial well-being.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Data augmentation using frontier LLM to generate medically plausible synthetic vignettes from curated data, 2) Fine-tuning open-source foundation model for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and psychological support, 3) Expert evaluation by clinical and psychological specialists with iterative dataset enrichment.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, providing accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data scarcity and trustworthiness challenges, demonstrating successful application of LLMs to rare medical conditions through synthetic data generation and expert validation.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In

### [81] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench evaluates LLMs on resource-constrained scheduling problems, showing performance collapses when multiple constraint types interact, revealing limited generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of large language models in reasoning under high-constraint regimes for complex scheduling problems across various sectors.

Method: Developed a scalable framework that incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints in DAGs and introduces downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraints, evaluated through feasibility and error analysis.

Result: Strong models perform well on precedence-only DAGs but feasibility collapses when multiple constraint types interact, with constraint interaction being the main bottleneck rather than graph depth.

Conclusion: LLMs have limited generalization capabilities for complex constraint reasoning, and performance on synthetic problems doesn't guarantee transfer to real-world domain scenarios.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free agentic system combining VLM and LLMs to convert rough hand sketches into precise, editable SVG diagrams through iterative qualitative editing loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with spatial precision and symbolic structure required for diagram generation, needing a solution that preserves alignment, connectivity and produces editable outputs.

Method: Iterative loop system: VLM critic proposes relational edits, multiple LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies, VLM judge selects best candidate. Uses qualitative reasoning over numerical estimates.

Result: Outperforms GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on 10 flowchart sketches, better reconstructing layout/structure and accurately composing primitives without unwanted text.

Conclusion: The approach produces programmatic SVGs that are extensible to presentation tools, supports human corrections, and is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing

*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology improves agent memory quality by processing short-term memory into multiple long-term fragments with retrieval and contextual units, enhancing recall and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory modules like MemoryBank and A-MEM have poor quality stored memory content, which negatively impacts recall performance and response quality in language model agents.

Method: Designed a multiple memory system (MMS) that processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory fragments, creates retrieval memory units and contextual memory units with one-to-one correspondence, and matches relevant units during retrieval.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo dataset showed effectiveness compared to three other methods. Ablation studies confirmed memory unit rationality, and analysis demonstrated robustness regarding memory segment numbers and storage overhead.

Conclusion: MMS effectively utilizes historical data by constructing high-quality long-term memory content, proving practical value for language model agents handling vast interaction data.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory framework that uses multi-granularity memory to enhance LLM-based agents for flexible planning in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents rely on single-granularity memory from environmental interactions, which limits knowledge diversity and planning flexibility due to constrained experience quality.

Method: Proposes a framework that grounds environmental information into coarse-grained focus points for experience collection, then extracts actionable hybrid-grained tips from experiences. At inference, retrieves relevant experiences and tips, and uses fine-grained key information for self-QA reflection and plan correction when facing anomalies.

Result: The framework enables more flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios by leveraging multi-granularity memory rather than single-granularity approaches.

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory provides a novel approach to enhance LLM-based agents' planning capabilities by grounding memories at different granularities, overcoming limitations of existing single-granularity memory mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW unifies expert demonstrations and human preferences for offline RL by using similarity search to assign stepwise importance weights, enabling better credit assignment and outperforming prior methods on robot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL typically requires well-defined reward functions that are expensive to design. Human feedback alternatives (demonstrations and preferences) have complementary limitations - demonstrations are costly and limited, while preferences lack clear credit assignment.

Method: Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) searches for similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations for each transition in preference-labeled trajectories, then derives stepwise importance weights based on similarity scores to guide preference learning.

Result: SPW enables effective joint learning from both preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that use both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SPW successfully unifies two forms of human feedback by addressing the credit assignment problem in preferences through similarity-based weighting from demonstrations, achieving superior performance in offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETAIL dataset and TGMA framework to address limitations in current travel planning systems, improving performance from 1.0% to 2.72% pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current travel planning systems are misaligned with real-world scenarios - they require explicit queries, ignore environmental factors and user preferences, and only generate basic POI arrangements without rich details.

Method: Constructed RETAIL dataset supporting implicit/explicit queries with revision needs, and proposed TGMA (topic-guided multi-agent framework) for environmental awareness and detailed travel planning.

Result: Existing strongest model achieved only 1.0% pass rate, while TGMA demonstrated substantially improved performance at 2.72% pass rate.

Conclusion: TGMA offers promising directions for real-world travel planning by addressing key limitations of current systems through improved dataset design and multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: Existing automated ECG approaches struggle with generalization across clinical tasks and lack open-ended reasoning capabilities, limiting their diagnostic utility.

Method: Discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using lead-independent encoder and quantization, extends LLM vocabulary with ECG tokens, pretrains on ECG forecasting, and performs instruction tuning for ECG QA and report generation.

Result: Achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings without modifying core model architecture.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective integration of symbolic ECG representations into LLMs, highlighting potential for medical reasoning through unified multimodal processing.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Motivation: Address overthinking in LLM chains-of-thought that causes computational waste and slower responses by enabling adaptive reasoning based on task complexity.

Method: Three-stage training pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning to predict reasoning budget and partition reasoning into blocks.

Result: Framework allows LLMs to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference, enabling flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: Think in Blocks provides an effective solution for adaptive reasoning in LLMs, balancing computational efficiency with reasoning performance across varying task complexities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study cooperative behavior in autonomous AI agents by testing super-additive cooperation theory, which suggests repeated interactions plus inter-group rivalry drive human cooperation tendencies.

Method: Virtual tournament where language model agents grouped into teams play Prisoner's Dilemma, simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition between teams.

Result: The combination of repeated interactions and inter-group competition substantially boosts both overall and initial one-shot cooperation levels among AI agents.

Conclusion: Intergroup competition can counter-intuitively result in more cooperative behavior, providing crucial insights for designing future multi-agent AI systems that align with human values.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: Existing 3D reasoning approaches generate short program chains due to simple dataset questions, limiting LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities in 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes combinatorial iterative evolutionary approach to generate complex questions on SQA3D benchmark, then fine-tunes LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization to optimize toolchain strategies.

Result: Enhanced LLM proficiency in 3D tool usage and improved accuracy in complex 3D situated reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DeepThink3D successfully addresses the challenge of simple reasoning chains by generating complex questions and optimizing tool usage strategies, significantly improving LLMs' 3D reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

TL;DR: A framework using dynamical systems theory and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent to analyze RL policies, identifying safety barriers and failure modes through Lagrangian Coherent Structures, with quantitative metrics for formal safety assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal verification methods for reinforcement learning policies in safety-critical systems, where traditional reward-based evaluation may miss critical flaws and safety risks.

Method: Analyze RL agent-environment combination as discrete-time autonomous dynamical system using Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), with quantitative metrics (MBR, ASAS, TASAS) for safety measurement and local stability guarantees.

Result: Framework successfully identifies repelling LCS as safety barriers around unsafe regions and attracting LCS revealing convergence properties and trap states. Experiments in discrete/continuous control environments show comprehensive assessment of policy behavior, detecting flaws missed by reward-only evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides interpretable and quantitative safety analysis for RL policies, enabling formal verification of robustness and identification of critical failure modes that traditional reward metrics cannot detect, advancing safe RL deployment in critical systems.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentics is a modular framework for building agent-based systems that enables structured reasoning and compositional generalization through logical transduction of data types using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework that abstracts agents from logical flow and allows developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting prompts, enabling declarative data composition through LLMs.

Method: A modular framework where agents are used internally within data types to enable logical transduction among data. Uses LLMs to provide data types and execute logical transduction when types are connected, with a declarative language approach.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without performance sacrifice across domain-specific multiple-choice question answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization tasks.

Conclusion: Agentics provides an effective framework for building agent-based systems with structured reasoning capabilities, demonstrating practical applicability across various AI tasks while encouraging a data-modeling focused approach to AI development.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM is a vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory that maintains compatibility with existing ACT-R models while providing scalability and similarity advantages through vector representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable vector-symbolic alternative to ACT-R's Declarative Memory system that preserves compatibility with existing models while offering architectural advantages like similarity-based retrieval and improved scaling.

Method: Adapted HDM to work with Lisp ACT-R, developed vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, created text processing pipeline for document ingestion, and implemented novel vector-based chunk retrieval mechanism using token representations.

Result: Preliminary results show HDM maintains vector-symbolic advantages (chunk recall without storing actual chunks, scaling benefits) while allowing previous ACT-R models to work with minimal modifications to procedural and declarative memory components.

Conclusion: The HDM adaptation successfully bridges traditional ACT-R models with vector-symbolic advantages, with ongoing work focused on improving time-context representations and testing through instance-based learning theory applications.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [98] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICVs use information-theoretic Shapley values to quantify agent influence on teammates' instrumental empowerment through policy analysis alone, without value feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL evaluation focuses on team performance but lacks methods to understand individual agent contributions without explicit reward signals or value functions.

Method: Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs) based on information-theoretic Shapley values that measure causal influence on co-players' instrumental empowerment by assessing decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

Result: ICVs reveal agent strategies (similar/diverse) and identify beneficial behaviors for team success through deterministic decisions or preserved flexibility, across cooperative and competitive environments.

Conclusion: ICVs provide novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhance explainability in MARL systems by analyzing policy distributions to understand individual agent contributions.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes EU AI Act through techno-philosophical lens, revealing how AI data lifecycle creates recursive value chains that challenge Responsible AI frameworks, and proposes regulatory measures to address power asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems and identify regulatory blind spots in current AI governance frameworks, particularly how the AI lifecycle generates recursive value chains that concentrate power and value.

Method: Cross-disciplinary approach combining technical analysis with philosophical framework (Simondonian philosophy), developing a conceptual tool to model AI pipeline from data ingestion to deployment, and introducing the concept of 'futurity' to explain recursive AI lifecycle dynamics.

Result: Identifies that policymaking lacks understanding of the 'dynamic of becoming' in AI systems, reveals escalating power asymmetries favoring tech oligarchies through infrastructure control, and highlights the non-rivalrous, recursively generative nature of data in AI systems.

Conclusion: Effective AI regulation must address infrastructural and temporal dynamics through measures like lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback accountability, recursion transparency, and rights to contest recursive reuse to counter concentrated power and value accumulation.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Conclusion: NiceWebRL successfully enables researchers to conduct online human experiments with RL environments, facilitating the development of human-like, human-compatible, and human-assistive AI systems across various domains.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

*Cooper Elsworth,Keguo Huang,David Patterson,Ian Schneider,Robert Sedivy,Savannah Goodman,Ben Townsend,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Jeff Dean,Amin Vahdat,Ben Gomes,James Manyika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental impact in production, showing Gemini Apps text prompts consume 0.24 Wh energy (less than 9s TV) and 0.26 mL water (5 drops), with Google's efficiency efforts achieving 33x energy reduction and 44x carbon reduction over one year.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI adoption accelerates, there's a critical need to understand and mitigate environmental impact of AI serving, but no studies had measured these metrics in actual production environments before this research.

Method: Comprehensive methodology measuring energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads in large-scale production environment, accounting for full AI serving stack including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.

Result: Median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh energy and 0.26 mL water - substantially lower than public estimates. Google's efficiency efforts achieved 33x energy consumption reduction and 44x carbon footprint reduction for median text prompt over one year.

Conclusion: While AI serving impacts are relatively low compared to daily activities, comprehensive environmental measurement is critical for accurate model comparisons and incentivizing efficiency gains across the full AI serving stack.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using state-of-the-art language models to detect parasocial cues in AI conversations in real-time, showing promising results in identifying harmful parasocial relationships early.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parasocial relationships with AI agents can have severe negative effects on human well-being, but preventing them is challenging as these cues emerge gradually in private conversations and not all emotional engagement is harmful.

Method: Repurposed a state-of-the-art language model to create a response evaluation framework that assesses ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. Tested with a synthetic dataset of 30 dialogues covering parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations using iterative evaluation with five-stage testing.

Result: The framework successfully identified all parasocial conversations with no false positives under a tolerant unanimity rule, typically detecting harmful cues within the first few exchanges.

Conclusion: Evaluation agents show promise as a viable solution for preventing parasocial relationships with AI, providing preliminary evidence that real-time detection of harmful conversational patterns is feasible.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: LGT uses multi-agent LLMs with natural language reasoning and textual gradients to optimize ML configurations, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML configuration optimization treats dimensions independently and lacks interpretability, while automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning.

Method: Language-Guided Tuning (LGT) framework with three specialized LLM agents: Advisor (proposes changes), Evaluator (assesses progress), and Optimizer (refines decisions), using textual gradients for semantic understanding.

Result: Substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods on six diverse datasets, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: LGT provides an effective framework for ML configuration optimization that combines numerical optimization with semantic reasoning through multi-agent LLMs and textual gradients.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified co-training framework that integrates multiple safety behaviors (positive, negative, rejective) in a single SFT stage, enabling dynamic behavioral switching via system instructions or magic tokens at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety methods like SFT and RLHF rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained post-deployment controllability, requiring more efficient and flexible solutions.

Method: Proposes a co-training framework that simultaneously trains multiple safety behaviors within a single supervised fine-tuning stage, using system-level instructions or magic tokens to dynamically activate different safety modes during inference.

Result: Matches safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with 8B model surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance while significantly reducing training complexity and deployment costs. Creates a Safety Alignment Margin with well-separated response distributions.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety that enables fine-grained behavioral control through simple system instructions while maintaining strong safety performance.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Motivation: To provide task participants with preliminary results using automatic metrics before the official human evaluation is completed.

Method: Automatic evaluation metrics applied to machine translation systems in the WMT25 General MT Shared Task.

Result: Preliminary ranking generated, but noted to be potentially biased towards systems using re-ranking techniques like Quality Estimation or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding.

Conclusion: This is an interim report for participant guidance only; the official ranking will be based on more reliable human evaluation.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically creates datasets with native entities to address English-centric bias in multilingual mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning lags behind English due to scarcity of socio-cultural task datasets with accurate native entities like person names, organizations, and currencies. Existing benchmarks are mostly translated and retain English-centric entities.

Method: Introduces an LLM-driven framework for cultural localization that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources.

Result: Translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. The framework helps mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the cultural localization gap in multilingual math reasoning by automatically generating datasets with native entities, reducing English-centric bias and enhancing model performance across diverse languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

TL;DR: Improving instruction-tuned LLM for machine translation using DPO training on programmatically curated data, showing performance gains over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance general instruction-tuned large language models for machine translation with minimal data resources, using Slovene as a case study.

Method: Used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a curated subset of public data. Generated quality-ranked translation pairs from English Wikipedia using two LLMs (GaMS-9B-Instruct and EuroLLM-9B-Instruct), ranked with heuristics and COMET metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned model outperformed both baseline models, achieving COMET score gains of ~0.04 and ~0.02 respectively on Wikipedia translations, with more consistent avoidance of language and formatting errors.

Conclusion: DPO training with programmatically curated quality-ranked data effectively improves machine translation performance in instruction-tuned LLMs with relatively few resources.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

TL;DR: This paper addresses multilingual generalization challenges in Conversational XAI systems by introducing MultiCoXQL dataset extension and Compass dataset for custom input extraction, evaluating LLMs across five languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvXAI systems based on intent recognition face challenges with multilingual generalization due to training data scarcity and limited support for free-form custom inputs in non-English languages.

Method: Introduces MultiCoXQL (multilingual extension of CoXQL dataset across 5 languages) and Compass dataset for custom input extraction. Proposes new parsing approach and evaluates three LLMs using various parsing strategies on both datasets.

Result: Conducted comprehensive evaluations including monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual assessments using three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models across the five languages.

Conclusion: The proposed datasets and parsing approach help bridge the multilingual generalization gap in ConvXAI systems, enabling better support for diverse languages including low-resource ones and improving custom input handling capabilities.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,

### [110] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm uses an aligned draft model with an unaligned target model to achieve test-time alignment efficiency, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time alignment techniques for LLMs incur substantial inference costs, limiting practical application. The paper aims to address this efficiency bottleneck.

Method: Proposes SSS algorithm where draft model is aligned with human preferences while target model remains unchanged. Uses modified acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution to exploit distributional shift.

Result: Achieves superior gold reward scores at significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments.

Conclusion: SSS algorithm effectively addresses efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment while maintaining alignment quality, validating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [111] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall is a three-stage framework for evaluating recall in machine-generated text that decomposes answers into facts, filters candidates, and verifies alignment through structured entailment checks, outperforming existing methods on long-form QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recall metrics rely on lexical overlap which causes errors with paraphrased answers and unsubstantiated entities, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods suffer from misalignment and hallucinations without structured verification, particularly problematic in domains like medicine and law where omissions have serious consequences.

Method: A three-stage framework that: 1) decomposes answers into self-contained facts, 2) successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic filtering, and 3) verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks to reduce false positives/negatives while accommodating diverse phrasings.

Result: Substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks, validated with both human annotations and LLM-based judges.

Conclusion: LongRecall serves as a foundational building block for systematic recall assessment, effectively addressing limitations of existing methods by combining structured decomposition, filtering, and verification to ensure completeness of machine-generated text.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [112] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combining LLMs with combinatorial inference improves structured prediction by enhancing consistency and accuracy, with structured learning remaining valuable despite LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning in structured prediction tasks despite their general language capabilities, requiring methods to ensure structural consistency.

Method: Proposes combining LLMs with combinatorial inference, using prompting strategies to estimate LLM confidence values for symbolic inference, and employing calibration and fine-tuning with structured prediction objectives.

Result: Symbolic inference on top of prompting alone consistently leads to more accurate and consistent predictions across various prompting strategies, with structured learning further boosting performance on challenging tasks.

Conclusion: Structured learning remains valuable in the LLM era, and the combination of LLMs with symbolic inference effectively addresses hallucination and consistency issues in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nemotron-CC-Math is a high-quality mathematical corpus extracted from Common Crawl using a novel pipeline that preserves mathematical structure across various formats, yielding significant improvements in math and code reasoning when used for LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math datasets from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to brittle extraction methods, lossy HTML conversion, and failure to preserve mathematical structure, limiting their effectiveness for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: A novel domain-agnostic pipeline using layout-aware rendering with lynx and LLM-based cleaning to recover math across multiple formats (MathJax, KaTeX, MathML), preserve equation structure, remove boilerplate, standardize to LaTeX, and correct inconsistencies.

Result: Created Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens) datasets. Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ surpasses all prior open math datasets with 5.5x more tokens than previous best. Pretraining yielded +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ benchmarks, while improving general-domain performance.

Conclusion: This work presents the first reliable pipeline for extracting scientific content from web-scale data, achieving state-of-the-art results in math pretraining corpora and demonstrating measurable gains across math, code, and general reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

### [114] [Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139)
*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses how to handle questions with false assumptions by reducing the problem to fact verification and using external evidence to mitigate LLM hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often generate misleading answers to questions with false assumptions due to hallucinations, requiring a systematic approach to identify and address these false premises.

Method: The approach reduces the problem to fact verification, leverages external evidence retrieval, and generates/validates atomic assumptions to provide interpretable answers.

Result: Experiments with five LLMs show that incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial, and generating/validating atomic assumptions yields further improvements while providing interpretable answers.

Conclusion: Using external evidence and atomic assumption validation effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations and improves handling of questions with false assumptions across multiple domains.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMDR-Bench is a new multi-modal dialogue reasoning benchmark with 300 complex multi-turn scenarios, and CoLVLM Agent is a framework that enhances LVLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities through an iterative memory-perception-planning-execution cycle, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with complex multi-turn visually-grounded tasks requiring deep reasoning and sustained contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture real-world multi-modal interactions, leading to context loss and visual hallucinations.

Method: Introduces MMDR-Bench dataset with 300 complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios, and proposes CoLVLM Agent framework that enhances existing LVLMs through an iterative "memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle without requiring extensive re-training.

Result: CoLVLM Agent achieves average human evaluation score of 4.03, surpassing GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85). Shows significant advantages in reasoning depth, instruction adherence, error suppression, and maintains robust performance over extended dialogue turns.

Conclusion: The modular design and iterative approach of CoLVLM Agent effectively addresses complex multi-modal interactions, demonstrating superior performance and validating the framework's effectiveness for handling challenging multi-turn visually-grounded tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken is a semantic-aware tokenization framework that reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency by using contextual semantic embeddings and local clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens, achieving significant token reduction and speedup with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization approaches like BPE and WordPiece rely purely on frequency statistics and ignore semantic structure, leading to over-tokenization of redundant spans and poor utilization of contextual coherence, especially in long-context scenarios.

Method: SemToken extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders, performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens, and allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density (finer-grained in content-rich regions, coarser compression in repetitive/low-entropy spans).

Result: Experiments on WikiText-103 and LongBench show up to 2.4Ã reduction in token count and 1.9Ã speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic structure offers a promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large language models, and SemToken can be seamlessly integrated with modern LMs and attention acceleration methods.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM is a domain-specialized process reward model for financial reasoning that outperforms general PRMs and improves downstream LLM performance by 5-13% across different training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs are trained on general or STEM domains and perform poorly in finance where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and requires factual/regulatory correctness.

Method: Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision for fine-grained evaluation of financial reasoning. Applied in offline/online settings for: (1) trajectory selection for distillation, (2) dense rewards for RL, and (3) reward-informed Best-of-N inference.

Result: Outperforms general PRMs and domain baselines on financial benchmarks (CFLUE, FinQA). Downstream models show 12.9% gain in supervised learning, 5.2% in RL, and 5.1% in test-time performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reward modeling is valuable for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements over general approaches.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### [118] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK is a training-free KV cache compression method that applies channel-level pruning to reduce memory usage by over 30% while maintaining model accuracy, enabling longer sequence processing within the same memory budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus on temporal axis compression but neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions, limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: SPARK applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV cache at the channel level and dynamically restoring pruned entries during attention computation. It's a plug-and-play method orthogonal to existing compression techniques.

Result: Reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods, maintains performance with less than 5% degradation even at 80% pruning ratio, and enables longer sequence processing within same memory budget.

Conclusion: SPARK effectively addresses the KV cache bottleneck by leveraging channel-level sparsity, providing significant memory savings while preserving model accuracy and being compatible with existing compression techniques.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) is a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through internal-external knowledge self-selection and selective fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods while matching domain-pretrained LLMs at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific QA due to long-tail knowledge distribution. RAG has hallucination and latency issues, while continued pretraining is costly and inflexible across domains.

Method: Internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy, selective supervised fine-tuning, structured reasoning data generation pipeline, and GRPO integration for enhanced reasoning.

Result: S2K consistently outperforms existing methods on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: The progressive knowledge acquisition approach mirrors human learning and provides an effective, cost-efficient solution for domain-specific LLM performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER is a self-guided method that uses stepwise experience recall to improve LLM tool usage by dynamically retrieving from an expanding experience pool instead of relying on static libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step tool usage including tool selection, parameter generation, and planning. Existing methods require manual demonstration design and curated libraries, which demand substantial expert effort and become inefficient as tool diversity and task complexity scale.

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER) performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. It incrementally augments the pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion and improved performance over time without static or manually curated libraries.

Result: On ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves average improvements of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. On Ï-bench with real-world domains, SEER shows substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% with Qwen2.5-7B and 23.38% with Qwen2.5-72B models.

Conclusion: SEER effectively addresses LLM tool usage challenges by enabling continuous learning from past successful experiences, demonstrating significant performance improvements across different benchmarks and model sizes without requiring manual curation.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective checklist use improves evaluation performance in pairwise comparison tasks but shows inconsistent benefits in direct scoring. Checklist items often reflect human evaluation criteria despite low correlation, revealing inconsistencies in human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using LLMs faces challenges due to ambiguous criteria, and while automatic checklist generation is promising, its usefulness remains underexplored.

Method: Investigated whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively, generated checklists using six methods, evaluated effectiveness across eight model sizes, and identified checklist items correlating with human evaluations through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring tasks.

Result: Selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings, while benefits are less consistent in direct scoring. Checklist items with low correlation to human scores often still reflect human-written criteria.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human and automatic evaluations, as human evaluation inconsistencies were revealed.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor reduces SLM memory usage by 99% through dynamic vocabulary selection and embedding offloading, maintaining performance while overcoming limitations of static pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models face memory bottlenecks from large vocabulary components on edge devices, with existing static pruning methods causing information loss and lacking flexibility.

Method: Decoupled dynamic vocabulary framework based on lexical locality principle, using hybrid static-dynamic selection for LM Head and embedding offloading to enable on-demand vocabulary loading.

Result: Achieves up to 99% reduction in vocabulary-related memory usage with minimal or no performance degradation across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: VocabTailor significantly outperforms static vocabulary pruning by providing flexible, efficient memory optimization while preserving model performance for edge deployment.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: WangchanThaiInstruct is a human-authored Thai instruction dataset that enables better LLM performance in Thai through culturally-grounded native supervision, outperforming translation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks rely on translations which miss cultural and domain-specific nuances needed for real-world use in low-resource languages like Thai.

Method: Created a human-authored Thai dataset through multi-stage quality control with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers, covering four professional domains and seven task types. Used for zero-shot evaluation and instruction tuning studies with ablations.

Result: Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Zero-shot evaluation revealed performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks.

Conclusion: Culturally and professionally grounded instruction data is essential for improving LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings, as native supervision significantly outperforms translation-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

*Sangmin Lee,Woojin Chung,Seyun Um,Hong-Goo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniCoM pipeline generates high-quality code-switched speech samples using SWORDS algorithm to replace words with translations while preserving semantics, creating CS-FLEURS corpus for multilingual ASR and speech translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching is common in real conversations but challenging for speech technology due to scarcity of suitable datasets, limiting development of multilingual systems.

Method: Proposes UniCoM pipeline with SWORDS algorithm that substitutes selected words with their translations while considering parts of speech, without altering sentence semantics.

Result: CS-FLEURS corpus achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: The approach advances code-switching speech technology and enables more inclusive multilingual systems by providing high-quality CS data.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

### [125] [EMNLP: Educator-role Moral and Normative Large Language Models Profiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15250)
*Yilin Jiang,Mingzi Zhang,Sheng Jin,Zengyi Yu,Xiangjie Kong,Binghao Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMNLP framework evaluates teacher-role LLMs' personality, moral development, and ethical vulnerability to soft prompt injection, revealing idealized personalities, strong abstract reasoning but emotional struggles, and a safety-capability paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation for LLMs simulating professional roles, particularly in educational contexts where teacher-role models need assessment for personality alignment, moral development, and ethical risks.

Method: Developed EMNLP framework with extended psychological scales and 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, conducted experiments on 12 LLMs using targeted soft prompt injection to evaluate compliance and vulnerability in teacher simulation scenarios.

Result: Teacher-role LLMs show more idealized/polarized personalities than humans, excel in abstract moral reasoning but struggle with emotional complexity. Stronger reasoning models are paradoxically more vulnerable to harmful injections, while temperature/hyperparameters have limited influence on risk behaviors.

Conclusion: EMNLP provides the first benchmark for ethical and psychological alignment assessment of teacher-role LLMs, highlighting critical safety-capability tradeoffs that need addressing for responsible educational AI deployment.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

### [126] [Conflict-Aware Soft Prompting for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15253)
*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE is a new RAG framework that addresses context-memory conflicts by using a context assessor to identify unreliable external context and guide reasoning toward more reliable knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems struggle when retrieved external context contradicts the LLM's internal parametric knowledge, leading to incorrect outputs due to context-memory conflicts.

Method: CARE uses a context assessor that encodes memory token embeddings and employs grounded/adversarial soft prompting to detect unreliable context and provide guidance signals to the base LLM.

Result: Extensive experiments show CARE achieves an average 5.0% performance improvement on QA and fact-checking benchmarks by effectively mitigating context-memory conflicts.

Conclusion: CARE establishes a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems that can better handle conflicts between external and internal knowledge sources.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

### [127] [TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274)
*Lekshmi R Nair,Arun Sankar,Koninika Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with temporal commonsense reasoning. This paper proposes a pipeline to automatically extract temporal commonsense from text using LLMs, creating TComQA dataset that improves model performance on temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with temporal commonsense reasoning because temporal information is often implicitly stated rather than explicitly mentioned in text. This limits their ability to understand event durations and temporal contexts.

Method: Proposed a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine temporal commonsense from text. Created TComQA dataset from SAMSum and RealNews corpora, validated through crowdsourcing.

Result: TComQA achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. Models trained with TComQA outperform LLMs fine-tuned on existing temporal question answering datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully extracts high-quality temporal commonsense knowledge, and the resulting TComQA dataset significantly improves temporal reasoning capabilities in language models compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CUPE is a lightweight phoneme recognition model that processes 120ms windows independently, achieving competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, but current approaches typically require analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns.

Method: Developed CUPE - a lightweight model that processes short, fixed-width windows (120ms, about one phoneme's length) independently to capture key phoneme features. Uses supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages.

Result: Achieves competitive cross-lingual performance despite fewer parameters than current approaches. Demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization in zero-shot tests on UCLA Phonetic Corpus.

Conclusion: Effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows, enabling pure phoneme representations without contextual influence.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

### [129] [KG-EDAS: A Meta-Metric Framework for Evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15357)
*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes EDAS, a unified meta-metric for Knowledge Graph Completion evaluation that integrates performance across multiple datasets and metrics into a single normalized score to address inconsistent rankings from traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC evaluation metrics (MRR, MR, Hit@k) produce inconsistent rankings across different datasets and even within the same dataset, making holistic model comparison difficult and hindering reliable model selection for downstream tasks.

Method: EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) - a robust meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score (0-1 range) using distance from average solution approach.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR) show EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into unified rankings, providing consistent, robust, and generalizable evaluation framework.

Conclusion: EDAS offers a global perspective for KGC model evaluation, enabling more informed model selection, promoting fairness in cross-dataset evaluation, and addressing the limitations of traditional isolated metrics through unified performance synthesis.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

TL;DR: Systematic review of 283 LLM benchmarks categorized into general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific types, identifying issues like data contamination, cultural biases, and lack of process evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid development of large language models, numerous evaluation benchmarks have emerged but lack systematic organization and analysis of their limitations and design principles.

Method: Categorization and systematic review of 283 representative benchmarks into three main categories: general capabilities (linguistics, knowledge, reasoning), domain-specific (natural sciences, humanities, engineering), and target-specific (risks, reliability, agents).

Result: Identified key problems including score inflation from data contamination, unfair evaluation due to cultural/linguistic biases, and insufficient evaluation of process credibility and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Provides a reference design paradigm for future benchmark innovation to address current limitations and guide more comprehensive evaluation of LLM capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation approaches for MLLMs focus on narrow aspects and overlook risks introduced by multimodality, leaving significant trustworthiness concerns unaddressed despite progress in capabilities.

Method: Proposes a three-dimensional framework covering truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, privacy; multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and mitigation strategies from data, model architecture, training, and inference perspectives. Includes 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets for holistic evaluation.

Result: Reveals significant vulnerabilities in current models, including trustworthiness-capability gaps and risk amplification through multimodal training/inference. Existing mitigation strategies show limited effectiveness with unexpected trade-offs that compromise utility.

Conclusion: Introduces Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach using chain-of-thought reasoning to discover underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results and providing practical insights for future improvements in balancing safety and performance.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An adaptive speculative decoding method that uses confidence-based uncertainty measures to dynamically adjust drafting length and verification criteria, improving speed while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods use static drafting lengths and rigid verification, which limits adaptability across different model uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: Information-theoretic framework using entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures from the drafter's output distribution to dynamically adjust the number of speculative tokens and modulate verification criteria.

Result: Significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores on machine translation and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models that adapts to varying uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [133] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Larger vocabularies help language models by reducing text complexity through tokenization, but mainly benefit frequent words while hurting rare words. The advantage comes from exploiting token-frequency imbalance rather than suffering from it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why larger vocabularies benefit language models, given that most common words are already single tokens in smaller vocabularies and larger vocabularies deepen token-frequency imbalance.

Method: Conducted controlled study scaling vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. Analyzed text complexity via Kolmogorov complexity, performed word-level loss decomposition, and constrained embedding norms to test effects of token-frequency imbalance.

Result: Larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively on the 2,500 most frequent words (despite increasing loss on rare words). The benefit transfers to downstream benchmarks where frequent words cover ~77% of tokens. Constraining embedding norms reversed gains, showing models exploit rather than suffer from imbalance.

Conclusion: The benefit of larger vocabularies comes from lowering the complexity of tokenized text, not from vocabulary size itself. This provides a principled approach for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifies loss dynamics in language model scaling.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LALMs show significant text bias when processing conflicting audio-text inputs, performing poorly on audio-centric tasks despite contradictory evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how Large Audio-Language Models handle conflicting information between audio and text modalities, as this remains largely unexamined despite their multimodal capabilities.

Method: Introduces MCR-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark with inconsistent audio-text pairs, evaluates across diverse audio tasks, investigates text bias factors, explores mitigation through supervised finetuning, and analyzes model confidence patterns.

Result: LALMs display significant bias toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence, leading to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks. Models show persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for improved modality balance during training and more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance robustness when handling conflicting multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented architectures and lack of transparency in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), where models are often released without training data and configurations, hindering comparison and reproducibility.

Method: Introduces LLaSO framework with three components: (1) LLaSO-Align (12M speech-text alignment corpus), (2) LLaSO-Instruct (13.5M multi-task instruction-tuning dataset), and (3) LLaSO-Eval (reproducible benchmark). Builds LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter model trained on public data.

Result: LLaSO-Base achieves normalized score of 0.72, surpassing comparable models. Analysis shows broader training coverage enhances performance but significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, especially in pure audio scenarios.

Conclusion: LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs by releasing complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,

applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

### [139] [Principle Methods of Rendering Non-equivalent Words from Uzbek and Dari to Russian and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15453)
*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research paper explores methods for translating non-equivalent words between languages, focusing on cultural and traditional terms that lack direct equivalents, and provides 25 examples from Dari/Uzbek to English/Russian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address translation challenges caused by non-equivalent words (food, garment, cultural terms) that create misunderstandings between languages and require professional rendering methods.

Method: Library-based research analyzing different ways and rules for rendering non-equivalent words from source to target languages.

Result: Developed professional translation methods and successfully rendered 25 non-equivalent words from Dari and Uzbek languages into English and Russian.

Conclusion: The research provides effective strategies for translating culturally-specific words that lack direct equivalents, helping to bridge understanding gaps between languages and improve translation accuracy.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: PyTOD is a programmable dialogue agent that generates executable code for state tracking and uses policy/execution feedback for error correction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SGD benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programmable task-oriented dialogue agents require accurate state tracking, but existing approaches have limitations in effectiveness and error correction capabilities.

Method: PyTOD generates executable code to track dialogue state and employs constrained decoding using language models instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata, with policy and execution feedback for error correction.

Result: PyTOD achieves state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD benchmark, surpassing strong baselines in both accuracy and robust user goal estimation as dialogues progress.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking for programmable task-oriented dialogue agents.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason is a novel evaluation framework for radiology reports that provides fine-grained error scoring with human-readable justifications, outperforming existing methods and achieving parity with GPT-4 while being more explainable and cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiology report evaluation methods are either too coarse or rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their clinical usefulness. There's a need for clinically grounded, interpretable, and fine-grained metrics.

Method: Builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization with two innovations: Sub-score Dynamic Weighting (adaptively prioritizes clinically challenging error types) and Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling (adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt difficulty from sub-score agreement).

Result: On the ReXVal benchmark, RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations while being explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: RadReason provides a clinically useful, interpretable evaluation framework for radiology reports that combines fine-grained error scoring with human-readable justifications, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

*Vedasamhitha Challapalli,Konduru Venkat Sai,Piyush Pratap Singh,Rupesh Prasad,Arvind Maurya,Atul Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM4Offer is a generative AI model for personalized offer generation that uses contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss to align customer personas with relevant offers, achieving 17% improvement in acceptance rates over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized marketing can significantly boost revenue (up to 40%) and customer satisfaction, but existing approaches focus mainly on recommendations and ads rather than offer generation, leaving untapped potential.

Method: Fine-tuned Google's T5-Small (60M) encoder-decoder model using contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss to align customer personas and offers in shared embedding space, trained on synthetic customer behavior dataset.

Result: 17% improvement in offer acceptance rate compared to supervised fine-tuning baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of contrastive learning for personalized offer generation.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning objectives significantly enhance personalized marketing by improving model generalizability and offer relevance, making SLM4Offer an effective approach for data-driven offer generation.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

*Sai Sundaresan,Harshita Chopra,Atanu R. Sinha,Koustava Goswami,Nagasai Saketh Naidu,Raghav Karan,N Anushka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small LMs trained with page-level tokenization outperform large LMs for browsing behavior prediction. Cluster-specific parameter training (HeTLM) beats single LM approaches and provides better alignment with lower variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question whether large language models can adequately capture users' subjective browsing behaviors and preferences, given that browsing logs form unique user-specific "languages" without natural language structure.

Method: Introduces HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model) using clusterwise training with page-level tokenization and heterogeneous cluster-specific parameters instead of a single parameter set.

Result: Small LMs with page-level tokenizer outperform large pretrained/finetuned LMs. HeTLM with cluster-specific parameters beats single LMs of same parameter count, achieving higher mean performance with lower variance.

Conclusion: Cluster-specific training approach better captures heterogeneous user behaviors, providing improved alignment and demonstrating that small, specialized models can outperform large general models for subjective browsing pattern prediction.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

### [144] [Influence-driven Curriculum Learning for Pre-training on Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15475)
*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning using model-centric difficulty metrics (training data influence) instead of human-centered metrics improves language model pre-training by over 10 percentage points compared to random order training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous curriculum learning approaches using human-centered difficulty metrics showed limited success for pre-training language models. The authors investigate whether using a model-centric difficulty metric that better reflects actual training difficulty could make curriculum learning more effective.

Method: The researchers experiment with sorting training examples by their 'training data influence' score, which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output during training. This replaces conventional human-centered difficulty metrics.

Result: Models trained using this curriculum learning approach with model-centric difficulty metrics outperform models trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training when using a model-centric notion of difficulty (training data influence) rather than human-centered difficulty metrics.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14

rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID: First multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection in political discourse, with 5,536 annotated sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts covering 12 nuanced identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing identity detection datasets are English-centric, single-label, and use coarse identity categories, lacking nuanced multilingual social identity analysis in political contexts.

Method: Created HebID corpus with manual annotations of 12 social identities from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (2018-2021), benchmarked multilabel/single-label encoders and Hebrew-tuned LLMs (2B-9B parameters).

Result: Hebrew-tuned LLMs achieved best performance (macro-F1 = 0.74). Applied classifier to analyze popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, gender variations, and compared elite discourse with public identity priorities from national surveys.

Conclusion: HebID provides comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and serves as model for similar research in other non-English political contexts, enabling nuanced identity analysis beyond English-centric approaches.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

TL;DR: First large-scale computational study of political delegitimization discourse (PDD) using Hebrew-language data from multiple sources, achieving strong classification performance and revealing increasing PDD trends over 30 years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze symbolic attacks on political legitimacy through computational methods, addressing a gap in understanding democratic discourse patterns.

Method: Curated and annotated Hebrew corpus of 10,410 sentences from Knesset speeches, Facebook posts, and news outlets. Developed two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs (DictaLM 2.0).

Result: Best model achieved F1 of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and macro-F1 of 0.67 for characteristics classification. Found rising PDD over 30 years, higher prevalence on social media, greater use by male politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors.

Conclusion: Automated PDD analysis is feasible and valuable for understanding democratic discourse, with applications for monitoring political communication patterns across platforms and time.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Motivation: Large language models have high computational costs that make them infeasible for targeted applications like sales and marketing outreach, despite their excellent text generation capabilities.

Method: Fine-tuning small language models (SLMs) for specific, high-value applications to create cost-effective 'Trained Miniatures' that generate similar domain-specific responses.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but implies that SLMs can achieve comparable domain-specific performance at a fraction of the cost of LLMs.

Conclusion: Small language models fine-tuned for specific applications offer a cost-effective alternative to large language models for targeted use cases like sales and marketing outreach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing
outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept

*Peng Ding,Wen Sun,Dailin Li,Wei Zou,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Chen,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDGO is a reinforcement learning framework that uses LLMs' own discrimination capabilities as reward signals to align generation and discrimination, improving safety against jailbreaking attacks without external data/models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show safety inconsistency - they can better identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This gap between discrimination and generation capabilities needs alignment.

Method: Proposed SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as reward signals for iterative self-improvement of generation safety.

Result: SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness. It shows robust performance against out-of-distribution jailbreaking attacks and enables generation enhancement with minimal discriminative samples.

Conclusion: Aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities through self-guided optimization provides an effective approach for improving safety without external resources, achieving tighter coupling between these capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurGE benchmark for evaluating automated scientific survey generation in computer science, including test instances and large academic corpus, with automated evaluation framework across four dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of scientific surveys is becoming infeasible due to rapid growth of academic literature, but progress in automated generation is hindered by lack of standardized benchmarks.

Method: Introduces SurGE benchmark with test instances (topic descriptions, expert-written surveys, cited references) and large academic corpus. Proposes automated evaluation framework measuring information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality.

Result: Evaluation shows survey generation remains highly challenging even for advanced self-reflection frameworks, highlighting task complexity.

Conclusion: SurGE addresses the standardization gap and enables better evaluation of automated survey generation methods, with findings showing the need for continued research in this area.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated

*Yifei Wang,Feng Xiong,Yong Wang,Linjing Li,Xiangxiang Chu,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pos2Distill is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones to mitigate positional bias in long-context processing, with specialized versions for retrieval and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias significantly impairs long-context comprehension and processing capabilities, and prior mitigation approaches through architectural modifications still leave significant bias persisting.

Method: A position-to-position knowledge distillation framework that leverages inherent position-induced disparity to counteract positional bias itself, with two specialized instantiations: Pos2Distill-RÂ¹ for retrieval and Pos2Distill-RÂ² for reasoning tasks.

Result: Achieves enhanced uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks, with strong cross-task generalization between the specialized systems.

Conclusion: Pos2Distill effectively addresses positional bias by transferring superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones, demonstrating improved performance and uniformity across different contextual positions in long-context processing tasks.

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on Bangla stemming approaches highlighting research gaps, implementation scarcity, and need for better evaluation metrics and robust stemmers for this low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla is the 7th most spoken language but digitally under-represented with limited annotated datasets. Stemming is crucial for reducing complexity in language analysis for this highly-inflectional language.

Method: Comprehensive survey of existing stemming approaches for Bangla, analyzing literature gaps, implementation accessibility, and evaluation methodologies.

Result: Identified significant research discontinuity, scarcity of accessible implementations for replication, and inadequate evaluation metrics in current Bangla stemming research.

Conclusion: Advocates for robust Bangla stemmer development with better evaluation metrics and continued research to address morphological challenges and enhance language processing.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

*Xinyi Ling,Hanwen Du,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EcomMMMU dataset reveals product images don't always improve MLLM performance in e-commerce tasks, sometimes degrading it. Proposed SUMEI method strategically uses images by predicting visual utilities first.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing e-commerce multimodal datasets are limited in scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine whether product images enhance or degrade understanding in multimodal tasks.

Method: Introduced EcomMMMU dataset with 406,190 samples and 8.9M images across 8 tasks, then proposed SUMEI - a data-driven method that predicts visual utilities before using images for downstream tasks.

Result: Analysis showed product images do not consistently improve performance and can sometimes degrade it, indicating MLLMs struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content. SUMEI demonstrated effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: Strategic utilization of multiple images via visual utility prediction (SUMEI) is necessary for effective multimodal understanding in e-commerce, as simply adding images doesn't guarantee performance improvement.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

TL;DR: Deep-DxSearch is an agentic RAG system using reinforcement learning for medical diagnosis, achieving superior accuracy over existing methods by integrating retrieval-aware reasoning with tailored rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical LLMs suffer from knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Existing retrieval-augmented methods have limited impact due to weak external knowledge utilization and poor feedback-reasoning traceability.

Method: End-to-end reinforcement learning training framework with LLM as core agent and retrieval corpus as environment. Uses tailored rewards for format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy. Constructs large-scale medical retrieval corpus from patient records and reliable knowledge sources.

Result: Substantially outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. Surpasses GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses with improved traceability and interpretability. Reward design and retrieval corpus components are critical for performance gains.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precise computations despite advances in reasoning methods like chain-of-thought. The generalization and actual reasoning behavior improvements from TIR remain unclear and need systematic evaluation.

Method: Created ReasonZoo benchmark with nine reasoning categories to evaluate TIR effectiveness. Proposed two novel metrics (PAC and AUC-PCC) to assess reasoning efficiency across domains.

Result: TIR-enabled models consistently outperform non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks. TIR enhances reasoning efficiency with improved PAC and AUC-PCC scores, indicating reduced overthinking.

Conclusion: TIR provides domain-general benefits and has strong potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through more streamlined and efficient reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Safe RL framework integrates ethical reasoning with driving objectives using ethical risk cost and prioritized experience replay for autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need robust ethical reasoning for widespread adoption to reduce traffic fatalities and improve transportation efficiency in human-mixed traffic environments.

Method: Two-level approach: decision level uses Safe RL with composite ethical risk cost and prioritized experience replay; execution level uses polynomial path planning with PID and Stanley controllers for trajectory execution.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance, validated on real-world traffic datasets with diverse road users.

Conclusion: First study demonstrating ethical decision-making via Safe RL in real-world scenarios, showing potential of combining control theory and data-driven learning for ethically accountable autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the best model for each patient using cohort retrieval and LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability in lung cancer risk prediction across different patient populations and clinical settings where no single model performs best for all cohorts.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) FAISS-based similarity search to retrieve the most relevant patient cohort from nine diverse real-world cohorts, 2) LLM prompting with retrieved cohort and performance metrics to recommend optimal prediction algorithm from eight representative models including classical, temporal, and multi-modal approaches.

Result: Enables dynamic, cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile using CT scans and structured metadata including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features.

Conclusion: Provides a practical path toward individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening through flexible, cohort-driven model selection across diverse clinical populations.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of symptom evolution complexity and insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression prediction.

Method: Integrates graph neural networks to model structural relationships among multimodal symptoms and Transformer architecture for temporal modeling. Uses structure-aware gating mechanism to fuse structural and temporal information with multi-component pipeline.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. Effectively distinguishes progression stages and captures personalized symptom trajectories with strong generalization.

Conclusion: Provides reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases like Parkinson's, demonstrating structural scalability and improved prediction capabilities.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: HHNAS-AM is a hierarchical hybrid neural architecture search method that uses adaptive mutation policies with Q-learning to efficiently explore text classification architectures, achieving 8% improvement on Spider dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NAS models for text classification lack hierarchical structure and have unorganized search spaces, making them inefficient and unable to navigate effectively through redundant architectures.

Method: Proposes hierarchical hybrid architecture search with adaptive mutation policies using Q-learning, employing architectural templates based on domain-specific cues to organize search spaces.

Result: Achieves 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines on the Spider dataset for database ID prediction task, consistently discovering high-performing architectures.

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM provides an effective probabilistic approach for neural architecture search in text classification by organizing search spaces hierarchically and using adaptive mutation strategies for efficient exploration.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO is a new preference optimization method that improves upon DPO by using gradient decoupling, stability enhancements, and controllable rejection suppression to prevent overfitting and collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO suffers from overfitting and collapse issues despite its popularity, so the authors aim to develop a more robust and stable preference optimization framework.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Gradient decoupling using absolute difference loss instead of log-sigmoid, 2) Stability improvement through offset constraint and positive regularization, 3) Controllable rejection suppression with gradient separation and tunable coefficient.

Result: LPO consistently improves performance across various tasks including general text, math, and text-to-speech tasks, demonstrating robust and tunable preference alignment.

Conclusion: LPO establishes itself as a superior alternative to DPO with better stability and performance, with all code, models, and data released publicly for community use.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads is a novel framework that transfers all representations (user, item, and cross representations) from pre-trained foundation models to advertising recommendation, using multi-granularity transfer mechanisms to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and achieve significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only transfer user representations and fail to utilize valuable item and cross representations, while also lacking effective mechanisms to bridge the gap between upstream pre-training and downstream advertising applications.

Method: Proposes LFM4Ads framework that comprehensively transfers all representations (URs, IRs, CRs), identifies optimal extraction layers for CRs, and employs multi-granularity transfer mechanisms including non-linear adapters, Isomorphic Interaction Module, and Standalone Retrieval.

Result: Successfully deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, achieving 10+ production launches across various scenarios with 2.45% overall GMV lift and estimated annual revenue increases in hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads demonstrates that comprehensive transfer of all representations with multi-granularity mechanisms significantly improves advertising recommendation performance and delivers substantial business value at industrial scale.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: This method enables scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning by automating the design of effective quantum circuits for recurrent models.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE is a curriculum-guided Monte Carlo ensemble masked autoencoder that restores fine-scale atmospheric features from noisy remote sensing data while providing pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional atmospheric profile reconstruction methods blur fine-scale structures and lack uncertainty quantification, while existing deep learning approaches don't provide confidence estimates for restored features.

Method: Uses a curriculum-guided masked autoencoder with progressive masking during training, and Monte Carlo ensemble sampling at inference to generate multiple reconstructions and aggregate them for mean prediction and uncertainty maps.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of fine-scale atmospheric features (updrafts, downdrafts, shear lines, vortices) with per-pixel uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The method enables enhanced convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves long-term climate reanalysis by providing both accurate reconstructions and uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for

### [168] [Generative Neural Operators of Log-Complexity Can Simultaneously Solve Infinitely Many Convex Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14995)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Ariel Neufeld,Philipp Schmocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper bridges the theory-practice gap for neural operators by showing that generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) can approximate solutions to convex optimization problems with logarithmic parameter growth in error tolerance, contrary to worst-case theoretical bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant gap between theoretical worst-case parameter bounds for neural operators (suggesting unrealistically large models) and experimental evidence showing practical success, specifically for solving families of convex optimization problems.

Method: Uses generative equilibrium operators (GEOs) with finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to solve convex optimization problems over separable Hilbert spaces, where inputs are smooth convex loss functions and outputs are approximate solutions.

Result: Shows that GEOs can uniformly approximate solutions with arbitrary precision, requiring only logarithmic growth in rank, depth, and width relative to approximation error. Validated on nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and financial hedging problems.

Conclusion: GEOs provide a theoretically sound framework that reconciles practical neural operator performance with mathematical guarantees, demonstrating efficient approximation capabilities for convex optimization problems in infinite-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel system combining static compiler analysis with Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently partition large ML models across distributed accelerators, overcoming memory constraints and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-partitioners for distributed ML models suffer from out-of-memory errors, slow exploration of exponential search spaces, and sub-optimal solutions due to artificial search space restrictions.

Method: Combines static compiler analysis to identify tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding and partitioning conflicts, with Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient exploration of the decision space.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering previously unknown superior solutions with full automation.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an effective automated solution for partitioning large ML models, addressing memory constraints and performance optimization challenges that plague existing approaches.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

TL;DR: SEAL is a new interpretable graph neural network that attributes molecular property predictions to meaningful chemical substructures, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human-aligned interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks for molecular property prediction lack interpretability, which limits trust in critical applications like drug discovery. Existing explanation techniques fail to reliably quantify contributions of individual atoms/substructures due to entangled message-passing dynamics.

Method: SEAL decomposes input molecular graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on outputs. The architecture explicitly reduces inter-fragment message passing to achieve strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study confirms it provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, offering a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling in applications like drug discovery and materials design.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

### [172] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization by training two identical models on independent bootstrap samples with periodic resets to keep them in the same basin, enabling local uncertainty estimation and adaptive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent lacks confidence measures, especially problematic in overparameterized/low-data regimes where models easily overfit. Bootstrapping is impractical for deep learning due to computational costs, inability to guide learning, and failure in non-convex landscapes.

Method: Two identical models trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples with periodic mean-reset to maintain both trajectories in the same basin. Their divergence reflects local uncertainty, which is used for adaptive weight sampling regularization favoring flatter solutions.

Result: The approach improves calibration and generalization in deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems, producing interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: Twin-Boot successfully integrates uncertainty estimation directly into the optimization process, addressing limitations of traditional bootstrapping while providing practical uncertainty quantification and regularization benefits.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

*Omkar Tupe,Max Hartman,Lav R. Varshney,Saurav Prakash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning improves convergence for nonlinear system identification as client count increases, with feature map design enabling better performance than centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical guarantees for federated nonlinear system identification and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to centralized methods, particularly showing how increasing clients improves convergence rates.

Method: Federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems using theoretical analysis and experimental validation with physical systems (pendulum, quadrotor) driven by i.i.d. control inputs and random perturbations, focusing on real-analytic feature functions including polynomial and trigonometric components.

Result: Convergence rate improves as number of clients increases; federated learning consistently enhances individual client convergence; performance depends on feature map design which can increase excitation in nonlinear settings; validated under varying noise levels and data distributions.

Conclusion: Federated nonlinear system identification is theoretically and experimentally effective, with convergence benefits scaling with client participation and feature map optimization providing additional performance gains over centralized approaches.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

*Chence Yang,Ci Zhang,Lei Lu,Qitao Tan,Sheng Li,Ao Li,Xulong Tang,Shaoyi Huang,Jinzhen Wang,Guoming Li,Jundong Li,Xiaoming Zhai,Jin Lu,Geng Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational challenges in layer-freezing for DNN training by proposing similarity-aware channel augmentation and progressive compression to maintain accuracy while reducing storage costs and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional layer-freezing methods still require forward propagation through frozen layers, limiting computational cost reduction. Caching feature maps presents challenges like effective augmentation application and substantial storage overhead that prior literature has overlooked.

Method: Proposes similarity-aware channel augmentation to cache channels with high augmentation sensitivity with minimal storage cost, and incorporates lossy data compression with progressive compression strategy that increases compression rates as more layers are frozen.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with only minor time overhead. Provides comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first comprehensive solution to overlooked challenges in feature map caching for layer-freezing, enabling efficient DNN training through systematic approaches to augmentation and storage optimization.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample has a known but different corruption probability. It establishes minimax rates for various estimation problems and shows optimal estimators should discard samples beyond a certain corruption threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity that arises naturally in distributed learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks where corruption rates vary across samples.

Method: The study provides theoretical analysis and establishes minimax rates for mean estimation of multivariate bounded distributions, univariate Gaussian distributions, multivariate Gaussian mean estimation, and linear regression under heterogeneous corruption patterns.

Result: The paper gives tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns in mean estimation problems and establishes minimax rates for squared error up to a factor of âd for multivariate Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Conclusion: Optimal estimators should discard samples beyond a certain corruption threshold determined by the empirical distribution of corruption rates, providing guidance for robust estimation in heterogeneous corruption settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: Proposes NGN-M, a momentum-based optimizer with adaptive step-size that improves stability and matches state-of-the-art performance while requiring less restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern momentum-based optimizers are sensitive to hyperparameter choices, especially step-size, making tuning difficult and resource-intensive. Recent efforts focus on improving stability across hyperparameter ranges.

Method: Introduces NGN-M, a momentum-based version of the NGN step-size method that combines momentum with adaptive step-size adaptation without requiring interpolation conditions or assumptions of bounded gradients/iterates.

Result: Achieves standard O(1/âK) convergence rate under less restrictive assumptions. Empirically demonstrates enhanced robustness to step-size choices while delivering comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: The combination of NGN step-size with momentum provides improved stability to hyperparameter choices while maintaining competitive performance, addressing key limitations of current optimization methods.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep neural networks in overparameterized regimes exhibit output space collapse that improves generalization but can lead to degeneracy where distinct inputs map to same outputs, though this can be bypassed using a novel "wormhole" solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why DNNs confidently classify random inputs (fooling examples) and investigate generalization behavior beyond conventional gradient-based approaches.

Method: Analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation without gradient optimization or explicit labels, examining overparameterized DNN regimes and developing wormhole solutions.

Result: DNNs show output feature space collapse that enhances generalization, but too many layers cause degeneracy with trivial solutions; wormhole solution reconciles meaningful and random labels.

Conclusion: Findings provide deeper insights into DNN generalization and shortcut learning, suggesting future research directions for unsupervised learning dynamics to bridge theory-practice gaps.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and enable more precise concept-level control through targeted suppression methods like APP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysemanticity in LLMs makes interpretation difficult, and while SAEs are proposed to address this, there's no quantitative comparison with base models on monosemanticity.

Method: Introduced Jensen-Shannon distance-based concept separability score, evaluated Gemma-2-2B with multiple SAE variants across 5 benchmarks, and developed Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP) for targeted concept suppression.

Result: SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability, but greater sparsity doesn't always improve separability and often hurts downstream performance. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Conclusion: SAEs provide better interpretability and concept-level control than base models, with APP method offering superior targeted suppression capabilities.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

TL;DR: Hydra is a 1.6B parameter hybrid architecture combining SSM backbone, sparse attention, MoE routing, and dual memory systems for efficient long-context language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient long-context language models by combining multiple architectural innovations (SSM efficiency, sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory) within a modular design that adapts to input characteristics.

Method: Integrates Mamba-style SSM backbone with intermittent sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems (workspace + factual PKM). Uses formal component interfaces, transparent parameter accounting, and staged curriculum training.

Result: Toy-scale prototype measurements demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (long-context throughput crossover, controllable expert routing), but no competitive full-scale performance claims are made.

Conclusion: Hydra presents a blueprint for modular, input-adaptive long-context models combining multiple architectural advantages. End-task performance validation at target scale remains future work, with open risks around training complexity and memory utilization.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-image generative models by developing techniques to erase unwanted concepts while maintaining image quality for other concepts.

Method: Developed Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark with hierarchical and compositional prompts to systematically test CET robustness across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.

Result: CETs can be bypassed using superclass-subclass hierarchies and semantically similar prompts. They exhibit attribute leakage and counterintuitive attention patterns (concentration or dispersal).

Conclusion: Current CETs are vulnerable to circumvention and have significant side effects, highlighting the need for more robust concept erasure methods. The authors release dataset and tools to support future research.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods require access to entire training dataset, which is impractical in real-world scenarios where original data may not be accessible due to privacy regulations or other constraints.

Method: Proposes a technique to estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, which is crucial for efficient unlearning. Leverages this estimation to enable zero-shot unlearning without requiring the original training dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in removing specific data while maintaining performance on remaining data.

Conclusion: The approach provides robust theoretical guarantees and enables practical source-free unlearning, addressing a critical need for privacy-preserving machine learning in real-world applications.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

*Sridhar Mahadevan*

TL;DR: This paper introduces universal reinforcement learning (URL), a categorial generalization of RL using mathematical abstractions from coinduction, universal coalgebras, topos theory, and distributed computation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more powerful mathematical foundation for reinforcement learning by generalizing it using category theory and coalgebraic structures, enabling better modeling of complex dynamical systems and distributed computation.

Method: The authors use category theory and functors to model RL algorithms, introduce universal coalgebras to represent various dynamical systems (MDPs, POMDPs, PSRs, LDSs), and generalize fixed-point finding in RL to determining final coalgebras asynchronously in parallel distributed manner.

Result: The paper establishes a comprehensive categorial framework for RL that can model various dynamical systems as coalgebras and provides mathematical tools to analyze asynchronous distributed computation in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Universal reinforcement learning provides a powerful mathematical abstraction that generalizes traditional RL using category theory and coalgebraic structures, offering new insights and tools for analyzing complex reinforcement learning problems in distributed settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

TL;DR: Reproducibility study of 11 state-of-the-art differentially private machine learning techniques reveals mixed results - some methods hold up under scrutiny while others fail outside original experimental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent proliferation of differentially private ML papers claiming state-of-the-art results without consensus on effectiveness, compounded by heterogeneity in implementations and experimental setups making direct comparisons difficult.

Method: Conducted reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from recent literature, addressing challenges unique to DPML reproducibility including additional randomness from DP noise.

Result: Varied outcomes - some methods performed as claimed while others faltered when tested outside their initial experimental conditions.

Conclusion: Derived insights and best practices for obtaining scientifically valid and reliable results in differentially private machine learning research.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM is an unlearning-based defense framework that removes harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and general capabilities through dynamic detection, token-level tracing, and constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks pose serious threats to LLM safety by bypassing alignment mechanisms to produce harmful content, requiring effective defense methods that maintain model quality.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) dynamic unsafe output detection using hybrid classifiers, 2) token-level harmful content tracing through FFN activations, 3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading quality.

Result: Substantially reduces attack success rates across multiple jailbreak benchmarks (Vicuna, LLaMA, GPT-J) while maintaining high general-purpose performance, outperforming standard defense methods like supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Unlearning is a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety, offering stronger safety guarantees, precise control over harmful behavior, and robustness to unseen attacks while preserving general performance.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep is a benchmarking framework for evaluating fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets, addressing the lack of standardized tools for data-level bias mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-processing methods for algorithmic fairness have received less attention than in-processing and post-processing approaches, despite advantages like model-agnosticism and better privacy compliance. There's a need for standardized evaluation tools for data-level fairness interventions.

Method: Built on AIF360 platform, FairPrep provides an extensible and modular framework with seamless integration of datasets, fairness interventions, and predictive models. It features batch-processing interface for efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and utility metrics.

Result: The framework enables standardized pipelines and reproducible evaluations of pre-processing fairness techniques, filling a critical gap in fairness benchmarking.

Conclusion: FairPrep provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness research by offering a comprehensive benchmarking solution for pre-processing methods in algorithmic fairness.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) suffer from the Frequency Principle that limits their ability to capture high-frequency features in high-dimensional problems, similar to conventional neural networks.

Method: Incorporates random Fourier features and leverages TNNs' tensor structure to extract frequency features via Discrete Fourier Transform on one-dimensional component functions, proposing a frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm.

Result: The proposed approach effectively mitigates the curse of dimensionality and significantly improves TNNs' ability to solve complex multi-scale problems, as validated through extensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Frequency-adaptive TNNs with random Fourier features and component function Fourier analysis provide an effective solution for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by enhancing expressivity for high-frequency features.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SleepDIFFormer - a transformer-based method for sleep stage classification using joint EEG-EOG representation learning with cross-domain alignment to improve generalization on unseen datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual sleep stage classification is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing ML/DL methods struggle with non-stationarity and variability of EEG/EOG signals, leading to poor generalization across different datasets.

Method: Developed Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) with MDTA architecture for processing EEG and EOG signals. Uses cross-domain alignment to learn domain-invariant joint representations while mitigating spatial and temporal attention noise through feature distribution alignment.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on five different sleep staging datasets. Thorough ablation analyses validated the method and differential attention weights were shown to align with characteristic sleep EEG patterns.

Conclusion: SleepDIFFormer effectively addresses generalization challenges in sleep stage classification and has significant implications for automated sleep quality assessment applications.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates multiple attribution perspectives instead of using single attribution labels, achieving significant offline and online performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CVR prediction approaches restrict training to labels from a single attribution mechanism, discarding complementary signals from alternative attribution perspectives that could better capture underlying conversion patterns.

Method: MAL framework with two core components: Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (multi-task learner integrating diverse attribution labels) and Primary Target Predictor (generating well-calibrated probabilities for system-optimized attribution). Uses CAT training strategy with Cartesian product of attribution label combinations for enriched supervision.

Result: Achieved +0.51% GAUC improvement on offline metrics and +2.6% increase in ROI in online experiments compared to single-attribution learning baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple attribution perspectives through the MAL framework significantly enhances CVR prediction performance and provides better return on investment for online advertising systems.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for synthesizing Pareto-optimal interpretations of black-box ML models with local optimality guarantees, balancing accuracy and explainability using SAT verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-objective interpretation synthesis either lack formal guarantees on Pareto-optimality or face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space.

Method: Uses multi-objective learning/search techniques to generate Pareto-optimal candidates, then verifies local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem solved with a SAT solver.

Result: The approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees while being more scalable.

Conclusion: The framework enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations with local optimality guarantees, addressing the trade-off between accuracy and explainability in black-box ML models.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poly-window contrastive learning framework for ECG analysis that extracts multiple temporal windows to learn temporally invariant features, outperforming traditional two-view methods with higher efficiency and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG analysis is limited by scarce annotated data. Existing self-supervised methods only generate pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings, missing opportunities to learn physiologically meaningful features.

Method: Extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by slow feature analysis, explicitly encourages learning temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time.

Result: Outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification on PTB-XL dataset: higher AUROC (0.891 vs 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs 0.679). Requires 4x fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs 128) and 14.8% total wall clock pre-training time reduction.

Conclusion: Poly-window contrastive learning is a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis, providing a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of self-consistency methods which suffer from diminishing accuracy returns and high computational overhead in LLM reasoning tasks.

Method: Leverages model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality reasoning traces during or after generation, requiring no additional training or hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 99.9% accuracy on AIME 2025 benchmark and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full parallel thinking.

Conclusion: DeepConf provides an efficient and effective approach to enhance LLM reasoning performance at test time with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSG metric fails to robustly measure KG complexity for link prediction, while new structural/semantic metrics like Relation Entropy show better correlation with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a dataset complexity metric for knowledge graph link prediction and examine its claimed properties.

Method: Critical examination of CSG in multi-relational link prediction with transformer embeddings, introduction of new structural/semantic complexity metrics (Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, Relation Type Cardinality), and benchmarking against standard performance metrics.

Result: CSG is highly sensitive to parametrization, doesn't scale with class cardinality, and shows weak correlation with MRR/Hit@1. New metrics exhibit strong inverse correlations with performance, while graph connectivity measures correlate positively with Hit@10.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed stability and predictive power don't hold in link prediction settings, highlighting the need for more stable and task-aligned complexity measures for knowledge-driven learning.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

TL;DR: PL-Reg introduces partial-logic regularization to handle unknown classes in visual classification, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require fully defined logical formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for handling unknown classes either favor known classes (class discovery) or suffer from catastrophic forgetting (incremental learning). Current logic-based methods like L-Reg require fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown classes.

Method: PL-Reg uses a novel partial-logic regularization term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas, enabling better adaptability to unknown classes. The approach is formally demonstrated to effectively explain tasks involving unknown classes using partial logic.

Result: Extensive experiments on Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery, and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks show consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: Partial logic is effective for tackling challenges related to unknown classes in visual classification tasks, providing improved generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

TL;DR: ExBigBang is a hybrid text-tabular transformer model for explainable persona classification that integrates contextual features and provides interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional persona classification models lack contextual understanding and explainability, making predictions difficult to interpret and justify for user-centric design decisions.

Method: A hybrid transformer-based architecture combining textual and tabular data with metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling in a cyclical process that dynamically updates with evolving user behaviors.

Result: Experiments show robust performance on benchmark datasets, with ablation studies confirming benefits of text-tabular integration and Explainable AI techniques providing prediction rationale.

Conclusion: ExBigBang successfully addresses contextual integration and explainability challenges in persona classification, offering a more interpretable and adaptive approach for user-centric design applications.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-users can coordinate to relabel their own data to improve fairness without changing the model training process, reducing unfairness with minimal impact on prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often preserve biases from training data, leading to unfair treatment of minority groups. Existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques typically incur utility costs and require organizational buy-in, while many models rely on user-contributed data.

Method: Proposed three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling within the Algorithmic Collective Action framework, where coordinated minority groups strategically relabel their own data to enhance fairness.

Result: A subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error, as validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: End-user collective action through strategic data relabeling provides an effective approach to improve fairness without requiring changes to the firm's training process or significant utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

### [198] [EvoFormer: Learning Dynamic Graph-Level Representations with Structural and Temporal Bias Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15378)
*Haodi Zhong,Liuxin Zou,Di Wang,Bo Wang,Zhenxing Niu,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoFormer is a Transformer framework for dynamic graph embedding that addresses structural visit bias and abrupt evolution blindness through structure-aware and evolution-sensitive modules, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph embedding methods suffer from Structural Visit Bias (uneven node sampling favoring high-degree nodes) and Abrupt Evolution Blindness (inability to detect sudden structural changes), leading to noisy representations and inconsistent temporal embeddings.

Method: EvoFormer uses: 1) Structure-Aware Transformer Module with node structural role positional encoding to mitigate structural bias; 2) Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module with three-step strategy: Random Walk Timestamp Classification, Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, and Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention with Edge Evolution Prediction.

Result: Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EvoFormer effectively corrects structural and temporal biases in dynamic graph embedding, demonstrating superior capability in capturing structural evolution and adapting to rapid temporal shifts.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on such graphs.

Method: Created CITE benchmark dataset with standardized evaluation procedures, conducted extensive benchmarking on node classification task, and compared four classes of learning paradigms: homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

Result: The paper introduces CITE as the largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials, providing comprehensive baseline experiments and ablation studies on heterogeneous and textual properties.

Conclusion: CITE provides a valuable benchmark resource with standardized evaluation protocols, enabling fair comparison and advancement of representation learning methods for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs in materials science domain.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional clustering methods that require pre-selecting cluster numbers, and leverage Federated Learning's decentralized approach that preserves data privacy by training models locally without sharing raw data.

Method: Implemented an evolving fuzzy system using PyTorch that dynamically adds new clusters as needed, tested on clustering and classification tasks with Federated Learning framework where models train locally on client devices and only share parameters with central server.

Result: Outperformed established classification methods on multiple well-known UCI datasets, demonstrating significant advantages in decentralized data processing despite computational intensity from overlap condition calculations.

Conclusion: The proposed evolving fuzzy system successfully enables dynamic cluster adaptation in Federated Learning environments, providing superior performance while maintaining data privacy through decentralized processing.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

*Jun Choi,Chang-Ock Lee,Minam Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid LS/gradient descent method to accelerate DeepONet training by decomposing large linear system into smaller branch and trunk subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet output is linear w.r.t. last layer parameters, but building full least squares system for all branch-trunk combinations is computationally infeasible.

Method: Decompose large LS system into two smaller subproblems for branch and trunk networks, solve separately. Generalizes to LÂ² loss with regularization, including physics-informed unsupervised learning.

Result: Efficient training method that avoids prohibitively large linear systems while maintaining optimization benefits of least squares for linear parameters.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid approach enables practical DeepONet training by breaking down computationally intensive LS problem into manageable components.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: A hybrid framework for Human Activity Recognition that first generalizes across users then rapidly adapts to individual users using few-shot learning on-device, achieving significant accuracy improvements with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in Human Activity Recognition when models are deployed to new users due to user-induced concept drift, highlighting the need for efficient personalization.

Method: Hybrid framework that generalizes across users first, then rapidly adapts to individual users using few-shot learning directly on-device by updating only the classifier layer with user-specific data.

Result: Implemented on RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller, achieved consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70% across three HAR scenarios (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture).

Conclusion: Fast, lightweight, and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, enabling scalable and user-aware HAR systems in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

### [203] [Measures of Overlapping Multivariate Gaussian Clusters in Unsupervised Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15444)
*Miha OÅ¾bot,Igor Å krjanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new fast dissimilarity measure for detecting overlapping multivariate Gaussian clusters in data streams, addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning from data streams requires clustering models that adapt to conceptual drift, but existing distribution dissimilarity measures are inadequate for detecting overlapping clusters due to computational demands and inability to handle all cluster shapes.

Method: Developed a new dissimilarity measure specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity, which can be computed faster than existing methods and handles various cluster shapes.

Result: The proposed method is several times faster than compared methods and effectively detects overlapping clusters while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: The new measure provides an efficient solution for detecting overlapping clusters in streaming data, overcoming computational and shape-handling limitations of traditional dissimilarity measures.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MRP uses irreversible projection transformations in hidden state space to completely eliminate harmful information from LLMs while preserving useful knowledge, enabling effective continuous unlearning and defense against relearning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods only suppress undesired data activation through parametric training without completely eradicating informational traces, making them vulnerable to relearning attacks and ineffective for continuous unlearning.

Method: Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) applies irreversible projection properties by implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers to eliminate harmful information.

Result: Experimental results show MRP enables effective continuous unlearning, successfully defends against relearning attacks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural model performance.

Conclusion: MRP overcomes fundamental limitations of existing unlearning approaches by completely eradicating harmful information through irreversible projections, providing a robust solution for ensuring LLM safety through effective machine unlearning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

TL;DR: A one-state differential equation model for molecular switches exhibits brain-like synaptic behavior with exact solvability, convergence, and fading memory properties for stable sequential data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretical foundation for using dynamic molecular switches as computational units in neuromorphic computing, inspired by brain-like synaptic behavior.

Method: Analysis of a linear-in-state, nonlinear-in-input differential equation model that is exactly solvable, examining its mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory.

Result: The model demonstrates co-existence of biologically-inspired switching behavior and desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on time-varying inputs.

Conclusion: This provides theoretical support for using molecular switches in neuromorphic architectures and could inspire more general exactly solvable models for brain-inspired computing.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaVerLy is a group local robustness verifier that improves neural network verification efficiency by batching similar Îµ-balls and verifying them jointly, achieving 2.3x average speedup over traditional one-by-one verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing local robustness verifiers suffer from long analysis times or precision loss when handling large sets of Îµ-balls.

Method: BaVerLy dynamically constructs mini-batches of Îµ-balls with similar network computations, verifies them jointly, and uses adaptive refinement - if a batch fails, it identifies and expedites analysis of the problematic Îµ-ball while leveraging results for others.

Result: Evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 networks shows BaVerLy achieves 2.3x average speedup (up to 4.1x), reducing analysis time from 24 hours to 6 hours in best cases.

Conclusion: Group verification approach significantly improves local robustness verification efficiency while maintaining soundness and completeness, making large-scale neural network verification more practical.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HypSeek is a hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds protein-ligand interactions in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, improving both virtual screening and affinity ranking performance by better capturing hierarchical structures and fine-grained affinity variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean embeddings fail to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations intrinsic to molecular interactions, particularly in challenging cases like activity cliffs where structurally similar ligands show large affinity gaps.

Method: A hyperbolic representation learning framework using Lorentz-model hyperbolic space with exponential geometry and negative curvature, featuring a protein-guided three-tower architecture to unify virtual screening and affinity ranking.

Result: Improves early enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%).

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry provides a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling, demonstrating significant benefits across both virtual screening and affinity ranking tasks.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

TL;DR: FairGuide is a framework that enhances graph neural network fairness by adding new links to biased graph structures, using differentiable community detection and meta-gradients to improve structural fairness across downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks face fairness challenges due to biases in graph structures, and existing biased structures need guidance toward unbiased ones through new link introductions to foster fair communities.

Method: Proposes FairGuide framework with differentiable community detection as pseudo downstream task, uses meta-gradients from fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that enhance structural fairness.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness and generalizability across various graph-based fairness tasks, with theoretical analysis confirming fairness generalization across downstream applications.

Conclusion: FairGuide successfully addresses graph fairness issues by structurally modifying graphs through strategic link additions, demonstrating strong performance and broad applicability in fairness enhancement.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Motivation: Address the need for distributed learning over networks that is both computationally and communicationally efficient, as traditional methods often trade off one for the other.

Method: ADMM-based algorithm with stochastic gradients for local computation efficiency, multiple training epochs between communications, and compressed transmissions for communication efficiency.

Result: Proves exact linear convergence in strongly convex settings and demonstrates superior performance through numerical comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques on classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves joint computation and communication efficiency while maintaining strong theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

### [210] [Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523)
*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF is a differentially private training method that perturbs polynomial approximations of loss functions instead of gradients, offering better computational efficiency and stability compared to DP-SGD in multi-user LDP settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based differential privacy methods like DP-SGD inject noise into gradients, which can be computationally inefficient and unstable. There's a need for more efficient and robust privacy-preserving training mechanisms, especially in multi-user local differential privacy scenarios with environmental noise.

Method: SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of the model's training loss function. Each user's data is privatized by adding calibrated noise to the polynomial coefficients rather than gradients. This approach supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all users.

Result: SPOF achieves up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to multi-user DP-SGD. It demonstrates robustness to environmental noise and maintains stable performance even with corrupted user inputs.

Conclusion: SPOF provides superior privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments, offering improved computational efficiency, stability, and noise robustness compared to gradient-based differential privacy methods like DP-SGD.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

TL;DR: Practical early fault detection for industrial pumps using real sensor data with dual-threshold labeling and synthetic fault injection, achieving high accuracy with Random Forest and XGBoost models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems operating in demanding environments, addressing the challenge of rare documented failures.

Method: Used real-world sensor data monitoring vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and current. Applied dual-threshold labeling (fixed engineering limits + 95th percentile adaptive thresholds). Injected synthetic fault signals using domain-specific rules. Trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM classifiers to detect normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority fault cases. SVM showed lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses confirmed robust detection capabilities with the hybrid method.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions. It can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures as a scalable predictive maintenance solution.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Conformal Prediction and Exceptional Model Mining to identify cohesive subgroups with exceptional model performance patterns, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification and interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nuanced model performance is essential for responsible deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, requiring methods that can identify regions of both high confidence and high uncertainty.

Method: Develops Conformalized Exceptional Model Mining framework with mSMoPE model class for uncertainty quantification using conformal prediction's coverage guarantees, and introduces Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL) quality measure to isolate exceptional performance subgroups.

Result: Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior for both multi-class classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: This work enhances model interpretability and reliability, advancing explainable AI and uncertainty quantification by providing a rigorous framework for identifying exceptional performance patterns in cohesive data subgroups.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An inductive, amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distribution alignment using mini-batch optimal transport and normalizing flows, outperforming RoPE and other methods while eliminating the need for test-time simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address model misspecification in simulation-based inference and overcome limitations of RoPE's transductive approach that requires batch test samples at inference time, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Mini-batch optimal transport with closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations for same latent parameters using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples; 2) Conditional normalizing flow trained to approximate OT-induced posterior for efficient inference without simulation access at test time.

Result: Matches or surpasses performance of RoPE and other standard SBI/non-SBI estimators across synthetic and real-world benchmarks including complex medical biomarker estimation.

Conclusion: Proposed framework offers improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments while maintaining strong performance through end-to-end trainable integration of calibration and distributional alignment.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

TL;DR: CoNTM is a continual neural topic model that learns new topics without forgetting previous ones, outperforming dynamic topic models in quality and perplexity while capturing temporal changes online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic models either require the entire training corpus at once (Dynamic Topic Models) or lack long-term memory (Online Topic Models), creating a gap for models that can continuously learn without forgetting previously learned topics.

Method: Proposes Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM) that uses a continuously updated global prior distribution to learn topic models at subsequent time steps while preserving knowledge from previous learning.

Result: CoNTM consistently outperformed dynamic topic models in topic quality and predictive perplexity, learned more diverse topics, and better captured temporal changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: CoNTM successfully fills the gap in continual learning for topic models by enabling continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting while maintaining superior performance in topic quality and temporal change capture.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRASPED is an unsupervised graph anomaly detection model that uses spectral graph wavelets for multi-scale analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised methods suffer from scarce labeled anomaly data, while unsupervised approaches either rely only on spatial information or use low-pass filters that lose multi-band analysis capabilities for detecting spectral shifts caused by anomalies.

Method: Proposes GRASPED with Graph Wavelet Convolution encoder and Wiener Graph Deconvolution decoder, creating bandpass filters to capture global and local graph information at multiple scales for attribute reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world graph anomaly detection datasets show GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The spectral encoder-decoder architecture with graph wavelets effectively captures anomaly information through multi-scale analysis without requiring labeled data, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised graph anomaly detection.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian analysis shows automated audio classifiers significantly distort effect size estimates in child language studies, with errors potentially masking true effects like sibling impact on language input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While automated classifiers are widely used to analyze children's audio data, little research examines how classification errors affect downstream statistical inferences and effect size estimates in language acquisition studies.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian approach to study algorithmic error effects, applying it to analyze LENA and ACLEW Voice Type Classifier data on sibling effects and child production-input associations.

Result: Classification errors significantly distorted estimates - automated annotations underestimated sibling negative effects on adult input by 20-80%, potentially making effects statistically non-significant.

Conclusion: Bayesian calibration can help recover unbiased estimates but isn't foolproof; classification errors with non-zero error rates affect any event detection classifier's downstream inferences.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

### [217] [Correct-By-Construction: Certified Individual Fairness through Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15642)
*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework that provides formal guarantees of individual fairness throughout machine learning training using randomized response mechanisms and fairness-preserving algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods lack formal guarantees and verification techniques don't actively enhance fairness during training. There's a need for approaches that both provide formal fairness guarantees and maintain them throughout the training process.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) provably fair initialization to start in a fair state, and (2) fairness-preserving training algorithm using randomized response mechanisms to protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness guarantees.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the approach produces models that are empirically fair and accurate, while being more efficient than certified training approaches that require neural network verification during training.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully provides formal individual fairness guarantees throughout the training process, addressing limitations of existing methods that either lack formal guarantees or rely on inefficient verification techniques.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AICMET is a transformer-based model that combines mechanistic compartmental models with amortized Bayesian inference for accurate dose-response forecasting with minimal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pharmacokinetic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is crucial for precision pharmacotherapy, but traditional methods require weeks of model development and extensive data.

Method: Transformer-based latent-variable framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference, pre-trained on synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability, and outperforms nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and neural ODE variants across public datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures offer a viable alternative to traditional pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, enabling rapid adaptation and personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

TL;DR: A novel multi-task learning framework using low-rank tensor decomposition to model heterogeneous subpopulations by capturing shared structures while preserving unique characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modeling heterogeneous subpopulations with varying individual characteristics and behaviors through personalized modeling approaches.

Method: Multi-task learning combined with low-rank tensor decomposition to decompose task model parameters into low-rank structures that capture commonalities and variations across tasks and subpopulations.

Result: Superior performance compared to benchmarks in simulation and case study datasets, especially in high-variability scenarios, with improved prediction accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances personalized modeling by sharing knowledge between similar tasks while preserving subpopulation-specific variations, revealing underlying patterns for better interpretability.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

*Eric Ye,Ren Tao,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent environment for studying social intelligence in AI agents, focusing on how agents can learn from human experts and engage in implicit cooperation through tool sharing and common goal achievement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI deployment requires agents to operate in multi-agent environments with human experts, but current research is limited by the lack of open-ended multi-agent environments that enable the study of social intelligence and adaptive learning.

Method: The authors developed an open-ended multi-agent environment where self-interested agents pursue complex independent goals, allowing research into social learning, implicit cooperation, emergent collaborative tool use, and the balance between cooperation and competition.

Result: The environment enables investigation of how social learning with experts impacts agent performance, whether agents benefit from cooperation or competition, and how emergent collaborative behaviors like tool sharing develop in multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable testbed for studying socially intelligent AI agents in realistic multi-agent scenarios, addressing the gap in open-ended environments needed to advance research on adaptive learning from experts and emergent cooperative behaviors.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

TL;DR: Enhanced PECANN framework with multiple penalty parameters, expectation-based constraint enforcement, Fourier features, time-windowing strategy, and adaptive penalty updates for improved PDE solution learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capability of physics and equality constrained neural networks (PECANN) for learning solutions of canonical partial differential equations by addressing limitations in constraint enforcement, memory efficiency, multi-scale feature handling, and long-time evolution.

Method: Generalized augmented Lagrangian method with multiple penalty parameters, reformulated constraint enforcement as expectations, incorporated Fourier feature mappings, introduced time-windowing strategy for continuity, and developed conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy.

Result: PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive accuracy across various problems including transonic rarefaction, reversible advection, high-wavenumber Helmholtz/Poisson equations, and inverse heat source identification, outperforming established methods and recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed advances significantly improve PECANN's robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding scientific computing problems through enhanced constraint enforcement, reduced memory overhead, and better handling of multi-scale features and long-time evolution.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores modest statistical differences between D-Wave quantum annealing and classical MCMC sampling for Restricted Boltzmann Machines, finding no training improvements but demonstrating potential for catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the absence of significant improvements in RBM trainability when using D-Wave quantum annealing sampling compared to classical MCMC methods, and to explore whether combining both approaches could yield benefits.

Method: A novel hybrid sampling approach combining classical MCMC and D-Wave quantum annealing contributions was investigated. The study also examined embedding RBMs into newer D-Wave hardware and tested quantum annealing-generated patterns for catastrophic forgetting mitigation through generative replay.

Result: No improvements in RBM training were achieved. Differences between QA and MCMC sampling were mainly found in medium-to-low probability regions, which are less important for sample quality. However, QA demonstrated ability to generate diverse patterns from lower-probability regions, showing comparable efficiency to classical methods for catastrophic forgetting mitigation with potential for speed advantages.

Conclusion: The modest sampling differences between QA and MCMC are insufficient to benefit RBM training, but QA's ability to generate diverse patterns from lower-probability regions shows promise for machine learning applications like catastrophic forgetting mitigation, particularly due to speed advantages and potential for further improvement.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin ThÃ©rien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that combines Top-k sparsification and 2-bit quantization to achieve extreme compression ratios (1-3% sparsity) while outperforming full-precision baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed training methods for LLMs still require communicating full model gradients, creating communication bottlenecks in bandwidth-constrained settings like cross-datacenter links, and often degrade performance compared to naive AdamW DDP.

Method: SparseLoCo leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization to compress gradients, using outer momentum approximation through error feedback with aggressive sparsity, and sparse aggregation to improve model performance.

Result: Achieves extreme compression ratios of up to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision DiLoCo in various communication-constrained LLM training settings.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication cost for LLM training in bandwidth-constrained environments, demonstrating that sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that diverse AI techniques from classical estimation to modern deep learning are fundamentally rooted in shared probabilistic principles for extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data across various domains.

Method: The paper analyzes techniques including maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms through illustrative scenarios in system identification, image classification, and language generation, showing how they address uncertainty.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

### [225] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas JÃ¤rve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates why likelihood-based out-of-distribution detection fails in practice despite being theoretically optimal, and tests whether using representation space instead of pixel space improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite likelihood being theoretically optimal for OOD detection under uniform OOD assumption, it often fails in practice. The authors want to determine if this failure is due to pixel space limitations or fundamental issues with density estimation.

Method: Trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 (instead of pixel space) and compared its likelihood-based OOD detection performance against state-of-the-art methods from OpenOOD suite.

Result: The paper tests whether representation space provides better density estimation for OOD detection compared to traditional pixel space approaches.

Conclusion: The research aims to identify whether the failure of likelihood-based OOD detection is a fundamental limitation or can be addressed by using better representation spaces.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Motivation: Address the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models in scientific professional fields, and advance toward AGI by developing specialized generalist models for scientific multimodal data analysis.

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 28B activated parameters, continual pre-training on 5T tokens (2.5T scientific), offline+online RL training with Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) on 1000+ tasks in InternBootCamp.

Result: Top-tier performance in online RL training, competitive on general reasoning tasks, significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpasses closed-source SOTA in professional tasks like molecular synthesis planning and crystal stability prediction.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 successfully bridges the gap between open-source and closed-source models in scientific domains through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, demonstrating strong potential for transforming scientific research.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space, where agents need to identify malicious behavior in real-time.

Method: Uses deep neural networks to approximate normal agent behavior as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions, defines normality scores, and employs two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations from normal behavior.

Result: Achieves AUC-ROC scores over 0.95 against most impactful attacks in all evaluated PettingZoo benchmarks, outperforming discrete counterpart methods.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized detector effectively identifies adversarial attacks in continuous action space multi-agent systems using local observations and statistical characterization of normal behavior.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,

### [230] [Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation for Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15185)
*Dingzhu Wen,Sijing Xie,Xiaowen Cao,Yuanhao Cui,Jie Xu,Yuanming Shi,Shuguang Cui*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes an Air-FEEL system with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) that uses over-the-air computation for federated learning. It examines how wireless sensing noise and AirComp distortions affect convergence, develops resource allocation strategies, and proposes an algorithm to coordinate batch size control and resource optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of integrated sensing, communication, and computation in federated edge learning systems, particularly how wireless sensing noise during data acquisition and AirComp distortions during model aggregation impact learning convergence and performance.

Method: The authors analyze convergence behavior considering sensing noise and AirComp distortions, design ISCC parameters to maximize loss function degradation under latency/energy constraints, and develop a low-complexity algorithm that alternately optimizes batch size control and network resource allocation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows sensing, communication, and computation compete for resources to determine convergence rate. The proposed algorithm coordinates batch size and resource allocation effectively - less sensing power needed with larger data batches, and optimal computation speed is the minimum satisfying latency constraints.

Conclusion: Numerical results on human motion recognition validate the convergence analysis and demonstrate that the ISCC algorithm successfully coordinates sensing, communication, and computation processes to enhance learning performance in Air-FEEL systems.

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural

and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage quantum computing's exponential speedup potential to enhance recommendation systems by integrating quantum machine learning with classical deep learning techniques for improved data processing and pattern recognition.

Method: Combines Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory with deep neural networks. User archetypes are clustered using K-Means, converted to polar patterns, and integrated into variational QHAM-based model. Features qubit optimization by updating only one random targeted qubit.

Result: Ideal environment: ROC 0.9795, accuracy 0.8841, F-1 Score 0.8786. Noisy environment (with real hardware-like errors): ROC 0.9177, accuracy 0.8013, F-1 Score 0.7866. Demonstrates consistent performance in both settings.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines variational quantum computing with deep learning, showing comparable performance to classical systems and robustness in noisy environments, providing a promising direction for future quantum-enhanced recommendation systems.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP is a black-box attack framework that uses LLMs' few-shot learning to generate adversarial documents that rank higher than factual content in neural retrieval systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ranking models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods require token-level perturbations or manual rewriting. FSAP aims to create a more scalable and effective attack through prompting.

Method: Uses few-shot prompting with LLMs, conditioning on harmful examples to generate fluent adversarial documents. Two modes: FSAP-IntraQ (same query examples) and FSAP-InterQ (cross-query generalization).

Result: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible documents on TREC Health Misinformation Tracks across four neural ranking models, with strong stance alignment and low detectability.

Conclusion: FSAP poses a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems, effectively working across both proprietary and open-source LLMs through prompt-based adversarial generation.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: COSETTE and MARIUS address limitations of generative recommender systems by introducing collaborative tokenization and a lightweight architecture that improves performance while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative recommender systems underperform compared to traditional ID-based models due to lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization and inefficiencies in encoder-decoder architectures.

Method: Proposed COSETTE for contrastive tokenization that integrates collaborative information, and MARIUS - a lightweight audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item decoding.

Result: Experiments show the approach narrows or eliminates the performance gap between generative and ID-based models while maintaining generative benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address key limitations of generative recommender systems, making them competitive with traditional approaches while offering generative advantages.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

### [235] [Personalized Recommendations via Active Utility-based Pairwise Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14911)
*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes a utility-based framework using pairwise comparisons for recommender systems, with active sampling to optimize task-specific utility functions, showing improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems rely on numerical ratings or full rankings, which are often biased and impractical. Pairwise comparisons offer a more intuitive and accurate way to capture user preferences.

Method: A model-agnostic utility-based framework using pairwise comparisons within the Plackett-Luce probabilistic framework. Includes active sampling strategy to select queries that maximize utility improvement for the final recommendation.

Result: Experimental results show the framework provides more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric personalized ranking in both movie recommendation and university admissions scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed utility-based framework with pairwise comparisons and active sampling offers a superior alternative to traditional rating-based approaches, enabling better alignment with application-specific objectives.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for

quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS

*Lining Chen,Qingwen Zeng,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: M-LLM^3REC is a novel recommendation framework that uses large language models to extract motivational signals from limited user interactions, addressing cold-start and sparse-data challenges through motivation-driven semantic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems struggle with cold-start and sparse-data scenarios, often introducing noise through pseudo-interaction sequences or overlooking dynamic user motivation shifts. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by focusing on motivation extraction.

Method: The framework consists of three integrated modules: Motivation-Oriented Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR), leveraging LLMs for deep motivational signal extraction.

Result: M-LLM^3REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and generalizable recommendations, showing particularly strong performance improvements in cold-start situations compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed motivation-driven approach using large language models effectively addresses cold-start and sparse-data challenges in recommendation systems, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations by focusing on user motivation signals.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

*Mandeep Rathee,Venktesh V,Sean MacAvaney,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Survey paper on advanced feedback-integrated retrieval and ranking methods for RAG systems, categorizing feedback signals and advocating for dynamic retrieval in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG pipelines treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components with static document retrieval, limiting performance on complex tasks requiring iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval.

Method: Structured overview and categorization of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate feedback signals based on their source and role in improving query, retrieved context, or document pool.

Result: Consolidation of developments from both IR and NLP communities, providing a framework to understand feedback-integrated retrieval methods for RAG systems.

Conclusion: Retrieval should be treated as a dynamic, learnable component in end-to-end RAG systems, bridging IR and NLP perspectives to improve performance on complex knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

### [239] [MMQ: Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization Tokenization for Semantic ID Generation and User Behavioral Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15281)
*Yi Xu,Moyu Zhang,Chenxuan Li,Zhihao Liao,Haibo Xing,Hao Deng,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MMQ is a two-stage framework that creates semantic IDs from multimodal content to improve recommender systems, addressing cross-modal synergy and semantic-behavioral gap challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ItemID-based recommender systems struggle with large dynamic item corpora and sparse long-tail data. Semantic IDs from multimodal content offer better generalization but face challenges in balancing cross-modal synergy with modality-specific uniqueness and bridging the semantic-behavioral gap.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Shared-specific tokenizer with multi-expert architecture (modality-specific and modality-shared experts) using orthogonal regularization, 2) Behavior-aware fine-tuning that adapts semantic IDs to recommendation objectives while preserving modality information through multimodal reconstruction loss.

Result: Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and behavioral adaptation, providing scalable solutions for both generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMQ successfully addresses key challenges in semantic ID-based recommender systems, offering a versatile framework that improves recommendations for new or rare items through effective multimodal representation learning and behavioral adaptation.

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

TL;DR: First Chinese speech database for heart failure detection, showing Chinese syllables contain HF-related information with effective classification using both patient-wise and pair-wise approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech is cost-effective for heart failure detection, but lacks research on whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information like other languages.

Method: Created Chinese speech database with paired recordings before/after hospitalization, used standard patient-wise and personalized pair-wise classification, proposed adaptive frequency filter for frequency analysis.

Result: Confirmed effectiveness of Chinese language in HF detection, identified individual differences as key accuracy factor, both classification approaches worked well.

Conclusion: Chinese speech contains HF-related information, pair-wise classification serves as ideal speaker-decoupled baseline, published database for future research.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

TL;DR: GOAT is a post-training framework that reduces hallucinations in LM-based TTS by optimizing trajectory flow with enhanced objectives and rewards, achieving over 50% error reduction without extra training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for hallucinated speech in LM-based TTS either require excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency, creating a need for efficient solutions.

Method: Reformulate TTS generation as trajectory flow optimization, introduce enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective with sharpened internal reward, and integrate reward temperature decay with learning rate optimization.

Result: Reduces over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowers uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: GOAT effectively mitigates hallucinations in LM-based TTS without relying on massive resources or adding inference cost, providing an efficient post-training solution.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

*Hadrien Pujol,Matteo Bevillacqua,Christophe Thirard,Thierry Mazoyer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Lightweight neural network improves gunshot detection performance in noisy battlefield environments by denoising acoustic signals, more than doubling detection rates when noise levels match muzzle blast amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gunshot detection systems on moving military vehicles suffer reduced performance due to environmental noise, requiring a solution that can operate efficiently on various hardware platforms with limited computational resources.

Method: Developed a lightweight neural network architecture (two hidden layer perceptron) combined with signal processing techniques to denoise acoustic signals and detect impulsive muzzle blast waveforms, avoiding heavy convolutional neural networks to minimize computational requirements.

Result: The denoising processing significantly increased detection rates - more than doubled the detect rate when root mean square noise values were of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude.

Conclusion: A lightweight neural network approach combined with appropriate signal processing can effectively improve gunshot detection performance in noisy battlefield environments while maintaining computational efficiency for deployment on various hardware platforms.

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic speech emotion recognition with sequential emotions, introduces Dirichlet-based emotional mixture modeling and human feedback integration for 3D avatar animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speech emotion recognition assumes static emotions per audio track, but emotions change over time. The study aims to capture dynamic emotional sequences for realistic 3D avatar animation.

Method: Multi-stage approach: 1) Train classical speech emotion recognition model, 2) Generate synthetic emotional sequences, 3) Improve model with human feedback, 4) Introduce novel Dirichlet distribution-based emotional mixture modeling.

Result: Dirichlet-based approach effectively models emotional mixtures. Human feedback integration improves model quality while simplifying annotation. Outperforms sliding window approach when evaluated on ground-truth emotions from 3D facial animation dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic emotion recognition framework with Dirichlet mixture modeling and human feedback provides effective sequential emotion tracking for 3D avatar applications, offering improvements over traditional static and sliding window methods.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

TL;DR: XAI-driven method using occlusion maps to identify disease-specific spectral features in cough sounds, revealing COPD-specific patterns not visible in raw spectrograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management by making AI models more interpretable and uncovering disease-specific acoustic signatures.

Method: Employ occlusion maps on CNN-processed cough spectrograms to highlight relevant spectral regions, then perform spectral analysis on weighted spectrograms to extract features.

Result: Significant differences found between disease groups (especially COPD) in identified spectral regions, contrasting with no significant differences in raw spectrograms.

Conclusion: XAI techniques can uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis through more interpretable results.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Novel filter bank feature with evenly distributed frequency intervals and parameter-free feature enhancement method for improved anomalous sound detection in machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous sound detection faces challenges due to uncertainty of anomaly locations and redundant information like noise in machine sounds, which hinder system performance improvement.

Method: Proposes evenly distributed filter banks for equal frequency attention and parameter-free feature enhancement based on pre-trained models to remove redundant information.

Result: Evaluation on DCASE 2024 Challenge dataset demonstrates significant improvements in anomalous sound detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance anomaly detection in machine sounds by addressing frequency bias and redundant information issues through novel audio features and parameter-free enhancement.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

*Huixin Zhong,Yanan Liu,Qi Cao,Shijin Wang,Zijing Ye,Zimu Wang,Shiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit social conformity driven primarily by informational influence (rational use of group cues) rather than normative social pressure, with uncertainty dramatically modulating this behavior - shifting from conservative evidence weighting to normative-like signal amplification in high uncertainty scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether human psychological mechanisms of social conformity (informational vs normative influence) apply to large language models, particularly how uncertainty moderates this behavior in collaborative team settings.

Method: Adapted information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to evaluate 9 leading LLMs across medical, legal, and investment decision-making scenarios while manipulating information uncertainty levels (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70 respectively).

Result: LLMs' conformity is underpinned by informational influence across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence rising with stronger evidence. Uncertainty dramatically modulates this: low-to-medium uncertainty triggers conservative evidence underweighting, while high uncertainty causes normative-like amplification where public signals are overweighted (beta > 1.55 vs private beta = 0.81).

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit human-like psychological mechanisms where informational processing forms the foundation, but uncertainty critically shifts behavior from analytical to heuristic processing, demonstrating that these models can develop normative-like social conformity under high uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Conclusion: Advances AI education field by offering reference points for interdisciplinary curriculum development to meet evolving industry needs.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further

*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the minimal requirements for symbolic thought in human brains, proposing that dynamic binding plus two types of hierarchical integration (multi-place predicates and structure mapping) are necessary for symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what enables human symbolic reasoning capabilities that distinguish us from most other animals and to identify the minimal neural mechanisms required for symbolic thought.

Method: Conducted 17 systematic simulations testing cognitive architectures with and without multi-place predicates and structure mapping capabilities on various tasks that couldn't be solved through diagnostic features alone.

Result: Results support the hypothesis that dynamic binding combined with multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought.

Conclusion: These findings help explain human symbolic reasoning capabilities, highlight differences between biological and machine learning intelligence, and have implications for bio-inspired AI development.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tongue imaging is crucial for Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis, but existing segmentation methods have limitations and lack robust, user-friendly tools, affecting classification accuracy and diagnostic reliability.

Method: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation approach with novel diffusion-based data augmentation to enhance generalization while reducing model size. The student model achieves significant parameter reduction while maintaining high performance.

Result: Student model achieves 95.22% mIoU segmentation performance with 96.6% parameter reduction compared to teacher models. Deployed as online/offline tool at https://itongue.cn/. Case study shows segmented tongue patches yield higher classification performance and better interpretability than original images.

Conclusion: First open-source tongue image segmentation tool that enables TCM practitioners to use without programming experience. Demonstrates that segmented tongue patches improve classification performance and interpretability for TCM constitution diagnosis.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Motivation: Traditional video compression methods are designed for human consumption, but neuromorphic event sensors produce asynchronous pixel data for computer vision applications, requiring new transmission solutions

Method: Survey existing event-based video systems, analyze technical issues with scalable event streaming, and propose a new streaming format based on Media Over QUIC protocol draft

Result: Identifies gaps in current event data transmission approaches and proposes a standardized low-latency streaming solution

Conclusion: Event-based sensors require specialized streaming formats different from traditional video, and Media Over QUIC provides a promising foundation for low-latency event data transmission

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC

TL;DR: A zero-shot 3D CT super-resolution method using diffusion-generated 2D X-ray priors and Gaussian splatting with negative alpha blending for enhanced detail reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of supervised SR methods requiring paired LR-HR data and zero-shot methods struggling with fine anatomical details in CT imaging.

Method: Leverages diffusion model trained on HR 2D X-ray projections with adaptive sampling strategy, uses 3D Gaussian splatting with negative alpha blending for residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections.

Result: Superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT super-resolution on two datasets, effectively recovering fine anatomical details.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses zero-shot 3D CT SR by combining diffusion-generated external priors with advanced 3D reconstruction techniques, achieving high-quality results without paired training data.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

TL;DR: Vision-language diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology using histopathology prompts to differentiate normal vs abnormal tissues without extensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires extensive annotated datasets which are scarce in digital pathology, while unsupervised anomaly detection can identify deviations from normal tissue distributions without exhaustive annotations.

Method: Combines vision-language model with diffusion model, using pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide reconstruction process and facilitate differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues.

Result: Experiments on gastric lymph node dataset and public breast lymph node dataset show promising performance for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs with generalization ability under domain shift.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates potential for effective unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology by leveraging vision-language guidance with diffusion models, addressing data scarcity issues while maintaining performance across different organ types.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

trustworthy medical AI solutions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DoSReMC is a batch normalization adaptation framework that improves cross-domain generalization for mammography cancer classification by fine-tuning only BN and FC layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for breast cancer recognition suffer performance degradation when applied to different domains due to domain shift, limiting safe AI deployment in clinical settings.

Method: Proposed DoSReMC framework that fine-tunes only batch normalization and fully connected layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters, combined with adversarial training for improved cross-domain generalization.

Result: Demonstrated that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence and significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC effectively addresses this limitation.

Conclusion: DoSReMC provides a practical pathway toward robust and generalizable mammography classification systems that can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

### [257] [Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553)
*Jin Ye,Jingran Wang,Fengchao Xiong,Jingzhou Chen,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that combines 2D/3D convolutional sparse representations with transformer blocks for robust hyperspectral image denoising with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding methods for HSI denoising lack convergence guarantees as they use predefined network depths, while DEQ models naturally align with optimization through fixed-point solutions.

Method: Proposes DECSC framework unifying local spatial-spectral correlations (3D CSC), nonlocal self-similarities (transformer blocks), and global spatial consistency (2D CSC). Formulates proximal gradient descent as fixed-point problem within DEQ framework.

Result: Experimental results show superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The DECSC framework effectively addresses HSI denoising with convergence guarantees by leveraging DEQ models and comprehensive feature representation through combined 2D/3D CSC and transformer components.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [258] [Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594)
*Ana C. Perre,LuÃ­s A. Alexandre,LuÃ­s C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study investigates artificial generation of dual-energy subtracted (DES) mammography images from low-energy images using three deep learning models, with the pre-trained U-Net achieving best results (85.59% F1 score) though still below real DES images (90.35%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce patient radiation exposure by generating virtual DES images from LE images instead of acquiring high-energy images, potentially making CESM examinations safer.

Method: Evaluated three models: pre-trained U-Net, end-to-end trained U-Net, and CycleGAN for generating virtual DES images from LE images, then assessed their impact on malignant/non-malignant classification performance.

Result: Pre-trained U-Net performed best with 85.59% F1 score using virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with real DES images. Real DES images contain additional diagnostic information that improves classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Virtual DES image generation shows considerable potential, and future advancements may narrow the performance gap to make exclusive reliance on virtual images clinically viable for reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Novel approach using radiologists' per-pixel confidence values instead of absolute ground truth labels for lung ultrasound segmentation, showing improved performance and better downstream clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inter-observer variability and label uncertainty in medical imaging, particularly in lung ultrasound where visual interpretation is subjective and annotations are challenging even for experienced clinicians.

Method: Data annotation protocol capturing radiologists' confidence per pixel, training AI models with binarized labels using confidence thresholds (60% works best), and evaluating various methods to incorporate uncertainty into learning.

Result: Training with confidence values improves segmentation performance and enhances downstream clinical tasks: S/F oxygenation ratio estimation, S/F ratio change classification, and 30-day patient readmission prediction. High confidence thresholds (60%) outperform naive 50% approach.

Conclusion: Label confidence is a valuable signal that significantly enhances AI reliability and clinical utility in medical imaging when properly leveraged through confidence-based training approaches.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

TL;DR: HessNet is a lightweight neural network with only 6000 parameters that uses Hessian matrices for 3D brain vessel segmentation in MRA images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling CPU-based processing and facilitating creation of a large annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations, and current methods (manual segmentation or classical filters like Frangi) lack sufficient accuracy for surgical procedures like aneurysm repair.

Method: Proposed HessNet - a semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of tubular structures. The solution has only 6000 parameters and can run on CPU.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art vessel segmentation accuracy on minimal training dataset. Enabled creation of a large semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset (200 images from IXI dataset) with expert supervision. Significantly reduces resource requirements for training.

Conclusion: HessNet provides high accuracy vessel segmentation, allows experts to focus on complex cases, and facilitates the creation of annotated datasets for brain MRA vessel segmentation, addressing the current lack of publicly available training data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GAN-based super-resolution improves 4D Flow MRI near-wall velocity recovery, with Wasserstein GAN showing optimal stability and performance over non-adversarial methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI has clinical limitations due to low spatial resolution and noise, particularly affecting near-wall velocity measurements. GANs show promise for super-resolution but remain unexplored in 4D Flow MRI with implementation challenges.

Method: Used patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models converted to synthetic MRI images. Implemented dedicated GAN architecture and evaluated three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein GANs.

Result: Wasserstein GAN achieved best performance with vNRMSE of 6.9% vs 9.6% for non-adversarial reference. Showed optimal stability and incremental improvement over generator-only training (6.9% vs 7.2%). Outperformed baseline at low SNR (8.7% vs 10.7%).

Conclusion: GAN-based super-resolution enhances 4D Flow MRI, particularly in cerebrovascular regions, but requires careful selection of adversarial strategies with Wasserstein GAN demonstrating optimal stability and performance.

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Dynamic uncertainty-aware MRI acquisition framework that adaptively adjusts scan time per subject using probabilistic reconstruction and conformal prediction to provide calibrated confidence intervals for clinical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI acceleration uses fixed acquisition factors, resulting in either unnecessarily long scans or insufficient quality. There's a need for patient-specific acquisitions that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence.

Method: Uses probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, propagates through analysis pipeline to clinical metrics, applies conformal prediction for calibrated confidence intervals, and iteratively samples k-space until meeting precision targets.

Result: Reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal statistical guarantees on final image precision, validated on knee and cardiac MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Framework enables personalized, resource-efficient MRI by moving beyond fixed acceleration factors and providing uncertainty-aware adaptive acquisitions with statistical guarantees.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

TL;DR: Exhaustive computational analysis reveals 26.3% of 4x4 full-rank binary matrices cannot be expressed as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices, with matrix density being highly predictive (95.7% accuracy) and expressible matrices forming a low-dimensional variety.

Motivation: To resolve an open problem about whether all 4x4 full-rank matrices can be expressed as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices, and understand the algebraic constraints governing such factorizations.

Method: Exhaustive search over F_2 (binary field), sign enumeration over Z (integers), numerical verification over R (reals), and machine learning techniques to analyze the structure and dimensionality of expressible matrices.

Result: Found 5,304 counterexamples (26.3%) among 20,160 full-rank binary matrices. Matrix density predicts expressibility with 95.7% accuracy. Expressible matrices form an approximately 10-dimensional variety in 16D space, despite naive parameter count of 24.

Conclusion: Hadamard factorizability of 4x4 matrices is governed by deep algebraic constraints that create emergent low-dimensional structure, with matrix density serving as a strong predictor of expressibility across different mathematical fields.

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

### [265] [High-dimensional Asymptotics of Generalization Performance in Continual Ridge Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15494)
*Yihan Zhao,Wenqing Su,Ying Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of continual ridge regression in high-dimensional linear models using random matrix theory to derive exact asymptotic prediction risk expressions and characterize continual learning performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in theoretical understanding of continual learning generalization performance despite practical advances, particularly for adapting to real-world task and data distribution dynamics while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses random matrix theory to analyze continual ridge regression in high-dimensional linear models where dimension is proportional to sample size per task, deriving exact asymptotic expressions for prediction risk.

Result: Obtained exact expressions for asymptotic prediction risk, characterized three continual learning metrics (average risk, backward transfer, forward transfer), and revealed intriguing phenomena in risk curves showing how model specifications affect generalization performance.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides rigorous understanding of continual learning generalization, with simulation studies validating the theoretical findings about risk behavior and model specification effects.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

*Philipp Alexander Schwarz,Oliver Schacht,Sven Klaassen,Johannes Oberpriller,Martin Spindler*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Extends regression discontinuity design (RDD) to multi-dimensional settings, providing theoretical framework to identify and reduce non-compliant behavior in multi-score RDDs, with applications in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical settings often involve decision-making with multiple thresholds and criteria, but existing MRD approaches transform these to one-dimensional designs, which can introduce non-compliant behavior and estimation issues.

Method: Develops theoretical tools to categorize unit behavior types for multi-dimensional cutoff-rules, identifies conditions for existence and identification of cutoff-effects on compliers, and investigates how decomposing cutoff-rules alters unit behavior to remove non-compliant units.

Result: Framework validated on simulated and real-world semiconductor manufacturing data, showing decreased estimation variance and improved usability for refining production policies.

Conclusion: The MRD framework provides practical value in manufacturing by enabling better identification of causal effects in multi-dimensional settings and improving estimation precision through removal of non-compliant units.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

TL;DR: Mathematical equivalence established between SVM kernels and quantum propagators (Green's functions), with new Kernel Polynomial Method for custom kernel design that improves SVM predictive accuracy in physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexamined connection between Support Vector Machine kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, and leverage this relationship to improve SVM performance in physical systems.

Method: Established mathematical equivalence through operator inversion theory, analyzed common SVM kernels' correspondence to Green's functions, introduced Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels aligned with Green's functions, and conducted numerical experiments.

Result: Many common SVM kernels naturally correspond to Green's functions, but sigmoid kernel may not satisfy Mercer's theorem. Using positive-semidefinite kernels corresponding to Green's functions significantly improves SVM predictive accuracy in physical systems.

Conclusion: The mathematical equivalence between SVM kernels and quantum Green's functions provides a powerful framework for designing optimized kernels, particularly for physical system applications, with the KPM method enabling customized kernel development that enhances SVM performance.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Conclusion: Establishes correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for quantum reservoir computing and broader QML algorithms in the NISQ era.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

### [269] [Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15084)
*Yijin Ni,Xiaoming Huo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Novel kernel-based Equalized Odds formulation (EOâ) for fair representation learning that quantifies three core fairness objectives and provides theoretical guarantees with practical certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a rigorous and interpretable framework for fair representation learning that can quantify tradeoffs between different fairness criteria (independence, separation, calibration) while preserving prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposed EOâ criterion using kernel-based formulation, with empirical counterpart ÃOâ computable in quadratic time (linear-time approximations available). Derived concentration inequality for performance guarantees.

Result: EOâ satisfies both independence and separation under unbiased conditions, and preserves predictive accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration under biased conditions. Provides unified analytical characterization of fairness tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The kernel-based EOâ formulation offers a principled theoretical foundation for provably fair algorithmic design, with practical certificates of fairness compliance through derived error bounds and performance guarantees.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

*BjÃ¶rn Volkmann,Jan-Hendrik Ewering,Michael Meindl,Simon F. G. Ehlers,Thomas Seel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A general-purpose system identification tool that combines known dynamics with learning-based approximations of unknown system parts for both online and offline Bayesian inference, enabling fusion of diverse prior knowledge with data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fusing diverse prior knowledge (like partially known equations and smoothness assumptions) with limited data in dynamical system modeling, especially when dealing with latent states and nested functions.

Method: Proposes a novel interface for combining known dynamics functions with learning-based approximations of unknown system parts, deriving closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization without requiring user-tailored coordinate transformations or model inversions.

Result: Developed a consistent solution for both online and offline Bayesian inference and learning that can incorporate explicit and implicit prior system knowledge, demonstrated through three distinct case studies including experimental data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general-purpose tool for system identification that successfully integrates different sources of prior knowledge with data information, making it broadly applicable across various scenarios without requiring expert intervention for model transformations.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

### [271] [Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement: No Regret and the Choice of Incumbent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15674)
*Jingyi Wang,Haowei Wang,Szu Hui Ng,Cosmin G. Petra*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical analysis of cumulative regret upper bounds for Gaussian Process Expected Improvement (GP-EI) algorithm in Bayesian optimization, showing it achieves no-regret performance for various incumbent choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expected improvement is widely used in Bayesian optimization but its theoretical regret bounds remained an open question, particularly for noisy settings with different incumbent choices.

Method: The authors analyze GP-EI algorithm with three common incumbents (BPMI, BSPMI, BOI) in Bayesian setting where objective is sampled from GP, providing theoretical regret bounds for squared exponential and MatÃ©rn kernels.

Result: GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI achieves no-regret performance. GP-EI with BOI achieves either sublinear cumulative regret or fast converging noisy simple regret bounds for both kernel types.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical guidance for incumbent choice in GP-EI applications and validates findings through numerical experiments, establishing EI's theoretical foundation in noisy Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains challenging for predictive modeling like insurance pricing, requiring both accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes PIN architecture that mimics decision tree structure with shared feed-forward neural networks to capture pairwise interactions, enabling direct inspection of interaction effects.

Result: Empirical results on French motor insurance dataset show PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural network benchmarks in predictive accuracy while providing interpretable insights.

Conclusion: PIN successfully addresses the challenge of modeling feature interactions by combining predictive performance with intrinsic interpretability through pairwise interaction modeling and efficient SHAP computations.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is crucial for active learning in quantum chemistry, where computational costs vary significantly between high-fidelity and low-fidelity calculations. Leveraging cheaper low-fidelity computations can improve active learning efficiency.

Method: Proposes a novel uncertainty quantification approach that incorporates information from low-fidelity quantum chemical computations to inform active learning processes for predicting quantum chemical properties.

Conclusion: The low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification method effectively enhances active learning for quantum chemical property prediction, offering improved computational efficiency and accuracy while highlighting the importance of appropriate fidelity selection.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning
techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties.
In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less

proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active
learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties
such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces.
Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed

outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations
required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a
thorough benchmark.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GenTune is a system that helps designers understand and control AI-generated image prompts by allowing them to select image elements and trace them back to specific prompt labels for precise editing while maintaining global consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers face challenges with lengthy LLM-generated prompts making it hard to isolate keywords for specific visual element revisions, and inpainting struggles with global consistency and correctness.

Method: GenTune enables designers to select any element in a generated image, trace it back to corresponding prompt labels, and revise those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement.

Result: In a study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt-image comprehension, refinement quality, efficiency, and overall satisfaction (all p < .01) compared to current practice.

Conclusion: GenTune effectively enhances human-AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to image content, demonstrating practical value in real-world studio settings.

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Motivation: The rapid proliferation of EEG foundation models has created a fragmented research landscape with diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and lack of systematic categorization, making it difficult to organize and advance the field systematically.

Method: The study develops a comprehensive modality-oriented taxonomy that systematically organizes EEG foundation model research based on output modalities: native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal frameworks.

Result: The taxonomy provides a unified framework that rigorously analyzes each category's research ideas, theoretical foundations, and architectural innovations, while identifying key challenges including model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: This work bridges the fragmentation in EEG foundation model research by providing a reference framework that accelerates the translation of EEG models into scalable, interpretable, and online actionable solutions for neuroscience and AI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative knowledge graphs that reduces annotation inconsistency and redundancy using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic narrative graphs for visual narratives like comics suffer from inconsistency and redundancy where similar actions/events are labeled differently across annotations, limiting reasoning and generalization effectiveness.

Method: Proposes semantic normalization methods using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering to consolidate semantically related actions and events, reducing annotation noise and aligning symbolic categories across narrative levels while preserving interpretability.

Result: Applied to Manga109 dataset, normalization improves coherence and robustness in narrative reasoning tasks (action retrieval, character grounding, event summarization) while maintaining symbolic transparency.

Conclusion: Semantic normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event video representations have limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility. The authors previously proposed ADÎER representation to address these issues and now need better visualization tools for real-time transcoding processes.

Method: The paper presents improvements to the adder-viz software, which provides visualization capabilities for real-time event transcode processes and applications running in-the-loop.

Conclusion: The improved adder-viz software addresses visualization needs for real-time event video processing, supporting the broader adoption and development of the ADÎER representation in neuromorphic computing applications.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and

Motivation: To create a unified framework that bridges hierarchical agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and systematic tournament evaluation, addressing the need for reproducible cross-scale simulations with explicit couplings.

Method: Uses hierarchical lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that share a common context. Features evolutionary optimization (single/multi-objective), PyTorch integration, tournament tooling, and standardized evaluation metrics with persistence of seeds and results.

Result: Provides a practical framework that reduces glue code, improves comparability across studies, and enables composition of exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators without refactoring. Demonstrated with ecological and enterprise decision-making examples.

Conclusion: HEAS offers a foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry that yields reliable and reproducible results by unifying simulation, optimization, and evaluation in a single workflow.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

### [280] [Inference Time Debiasing Concepts in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14933)
*Lucas S. KupssinskÃ¼,Marco N. Bochernitsan,Jordan Kopper,OtÃ¡vio Parraga,Rodrigo C. Barros*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DeCoDi is a lightweight debiasing method for diffusion models that modifies the inference process to avoid biased latent regions, requiring no retraining and minimal compute overhead while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases in gender, ethnicity, and age representation. Existing debiasing methods are typically complex and compute-intensive, making them inaccessible to many practitioners.

Method: Changes the diffusion inference procedure to steer away from latent dimension regions associated with biased concepts. Works by modifying the sampling process without requiring model retraining or additional training data.

Result: Effectively mitigates gender, ethnicity, and age biases for concepts like nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Human evaluation of 1,200 images shows reliable agreement between evaluators and improved coverage of protected attributes. GPT4o automatic evaluation aligns with human assessment.

Conclusion: DeCoDi provides an accessible, efficient debiasing solution that can be applied to any diffusion-based image generation model, significantly improving diversity without compromising image quality or requiring substantial computational resources.

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Result: System validated through real-world experiments demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions with robust identification and tracking of large species.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a scalable, low-bandwidth, sensor-minimal solution for wildlife monitoring that operates effectively in natural habitats without centralized control.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to

TL;DR: Vision-based teleoperation system for quadruped robots using wrist tracking and collision avoidance for intuitive arm control in hazardous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperating quadruped robots with manipulator arms is challenging due to non-intuitive controls, high cognitive load, and collision risks in confined spaces, requiring more accessible and safer solutions.

Method: Uses vision-based pose estimation with external camera and ML model to detect operator's wrist position, maps movements to robotic arm commands in real-time, and employs trajectory planner for collision detection and prevention.

Result: System demonstrated robust real-time performance on actual robot, providing reliable and intuitive control with effective collision avoidance capabilities.

Conclusion: Proposed approach offers cost-effective, safe, and intuitive teleoperation solution suitable for industrial applications requiring precision and safety in high-risk environments.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift demonstrates successful automation of pallet pick-up operations using natural language guidance and foundation models, providing a viable solution for outdoor logistics and construction applications.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-frame final-state assessment in continuous drone operations and integrate LLM reasoning with physical execution constraints in embodied drones.

Method: Uses continuous state evaluation methodology for robust task outcome determination and hierarchical Behavior Tree modification model with multi-level plan analysis and constrained strategy space for structured reflective learning.

Result: Achieves 44.87% improvement in Success Rate over baseline methods, with real-world deployment reaching 96.25% SR using experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement.

Conclusion: SRDrone successfully integrates adaptive task refinement capabilities within industrial-grade BT planning framework, effectively combining LLM reasoning intelligence with physical execution constraints of embodied drones.

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification

Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement

Motivation: There's a significant disconnect between benchmarks for high-level language instruction following (assuming perfect execution) and low-level robot control (using simple commands), preventing comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both planning and execution are critical.

Method: Built a digital twin kitchen environment using Isaac Sim simulator with 500+ complex language instructions, supporting a mobile manipulator robot. Provides baseline methods including vision-language model for task planning and diffusion policy for low-level control, plus trajectory collection system.

Result: Kitchen-R offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent planning module assessment, independent control policy assessment, and integrated whole system evaluation.

Conclusion: Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents by unifying task planning and low-level control evaluation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

TL;DR: NeRD is a neural robot dynamics model that replaces traditional physics solvers in simulators, enabling accurate, generalizable simulation of articulated rigid bodies with contact constraints that can be fine-tuned from real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional analytical simulators struggle with high-DOF robots and complex mechanisms, while existing neural simulators lack generalization capabilities due to inadequate global state representations.

Method: Proposes NeRD - learned robot-specific dynamics models that replace low-level dynamics and contact solvers, using robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation integrated as backend solver in robotics simulator.

Result: NeRD simulators are stable and accurate over 1000+ simulation steps, generalize across tasks and environments, enable policy learning in neural engine, and can be fine-tuned from real-world data.

Conclusion: NeRD successfully bridges simulation-to-reality gap by providing generalizable neural simulators that outperform traditional methods while maintaining compatibility with existing simulation frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

TL;DR: PIP (Pause-Induced Perturbations) detects policy idling states and applies perturbations to help robots escape problematic basins of attraction, improving dexterous manipulation performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned dexterous manipulation policies often idle in certain states due to training data limitations, particularly in high-precision motion areas like grasping and object insertion, which reduces reliability and robustness.

Method: The approach detects idling behavior and applies perturbations at those states to help the policy escape problematic basins of attraction, using a simple method that requires no additional supervision or training.

Result: On simulated dual-arm tasks, PIP noticeably improves test-time performance. It also enables better iterative policy improvement and achieves 15-35% absolute success rate improvement on real-world insertion tasks requiring complex multi-finger manipulation.

Conclusion: Pause-Induced Perturbations is an effective approach for mitigating policy idling in dexterous manipulation, providing significant performance improvements in both simulation and real-world scenarios without additional training overhead.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

TL;DR: Self-learning GAN for single-shot X-ray phase retrieval without training data, enabling simultaneous phase and absorption reconstruction from holograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional phase retrieval methods rely on approximations and manual parameter tuning, making them unsuitable for complex experimental conditions and variable samples where training data is difficult to obtain.

Method: Physics-informed generative adversarial network that reconstructs both phase and absorbance from a single hologram without requiring paired, unpaired, or simulated training data.

Result: Robust performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets from PETRA III beamline.

Conclusion: The approach significantly broadens applicability of phase contrast imaging by eliminating the need for training data while enabling simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in PACG patients by integrating both structural (ONH) and functional (VF) parameters, as current methods using either alone may be insufficient.

Method: Analyzed 451 eyes from 299 PACG patients with >5 VF tests over >5 years. Used AI-segmented OCT to extract 31 ONH parameters and sector-based VF sensitivity. Trained multiple ML classifiers (Random Forest performed best) with SHAP analysis to identify key predictors.

Result: Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved best performance (AUC = 0.87). SHAP identified 6 key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior RNFL thickness, inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL+GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse (AUC 0.82 and 0.78 respectively).

Conclusion: Integration of ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves progression risk classification in PACG. Inferior ONH features (MRW and RNFL thickness) were most predictive, emphasizing the importance of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual

with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity

Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined

patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

TL;DR: ARF method effectively generates synthetic epidemiological data that reliably reproduces original study findings across multiple health domains, with improved performance when dimensionality is reduced and variables are pre-derived.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current synthetic data generation methods (poor quality, high computational demands, complexity) and evaluate whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key epidemiological findings.

Method: Used adversarial random forests (ARF) to synthesize tabular epidemiological data, replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications, and compared original vs synthetic results across various health domains.

Result: Synthetic data consistently reproduced original findings across all replicated studies, even with low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios. Dimensionality reduction and variable pre-derivation further enhanced result quality and stability.

Conclusion: ARF provides an efficient and convenient method for generating high-quality synthetic epidemiological data that reliably maintains statistical utility of original datasets.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

TL;DR: Equi-mRNA is the first codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous codon symmetries using group theory, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy and sequence generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology requires models that capture latent structure in synonymous codon usage, which modulates translation efficiency and gene expression. Existing methods fail to explicitly model the structured relationships from genetic code symmetries.

Method: Introduces Equi-mRNA, a codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that encodes synonymous codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)). Combines group-theoretic priors with auxiliary equivariance loss and symmetry-aware pooling.

Result: Achieves up to ~10% improvements in accuracy on expression, stability, and riboswitch prediction tasks. Generates mRNA constructs that are ~4x more realistic and ~28% better preserve functional properties. Learned representations recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns.

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA establishes a new biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling with significant implications for next-generation therapeutic design, offering novel insights into codon usage through interpretable learned representations.

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

TL;DR: Evaluation of machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieving best performance (F2-scores ~0.987).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective machine learning classifiers for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects through binary classification, addressing the need for accurate space object hazard assessment.

Method: Used binary classification framework with data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation to compare six classifiers: RFC, GBC, SVC, LDA, LR, and KNN.

Result: RFC and GBC performed best with F2-scores of 0.987 and 0.986 respectively, excellent accuracy rates (99.7% and 99.6%), and minimal false positives/negatives. SVC scored 0.896, while LDA, LR, and KNN performed moderately to poorly.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods (RFC and GBC) are most effective for NEO hazard prediction, demonstrating the importance of tailored model selection based on dataset characteristics and evaluation metrics. Future work should focus on hyperparameter optimization and advanced feature engineering.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

*Ethan Lake,Ehsan Pajouheshgar*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper reveals that 2D many-body memories are far more diverse than previously thought, with multiple distinct error-correcting mechanisms beyond Toom's rule, including noise-dependent information preservation and fluctuation-stabilized ordered phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the broader landscape of local non-equilibrium dynamics that can retain initial condition information for thermodynamically long times despite perturbations, moving beyond the single well-studied example of Toom's rule in 2D systems.

Method: Combination of rigorous mathematical proofs and machine learning approaches to systematically discover and analyze different types of 2D many-body memories.

Result: Discovered a vast landscape of 2D memories with qualitatively distinct error correction mechanisms from Toom's rule, including memories that only preserve information in the presence of noise and ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations.

Conclusion: Physical systems can perform robust information storage through many distinct mechanisms, demonstrating that the physics of many-body memories is significantly richer and more diverse than previously realized.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Flow Matching framework enables training on small lattice systems to generate reliable samples for much larger systems across continuous temperature ranges without retraining


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome scaling limitations of traditional MCMC methods for studying critical phenomena in many-body systems

Method: Machine learning framework based on Flow Matching with temperature-conditioned mapping, using CNN architecture with inductive biases for scale-invariant learning of local physical rules

Result: Successfully generated configurations for 128Ã128 lattice from training on 32Ã32 lattice, showing strong agreement with thermodynamic observables and correct capture of BKT transition signatures

Conclusion: Establishes 'train-small, generate-large' paradigm for efficient study of critical phenomena with significant computational advantages for thermodynamic limit exploration, applicable to various classical and quantum many-body systems

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

TL;DR: GenSIM is the first generative AI model for pan-Arctic sea ice prediction that accurately forecasts concentration, thickness, and drift in 12-hour windows with improved accuracy and computational efficiency over deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sea ice processes are complex and scale-invariant, making them challenging to model in Earth system models. Advanced numerical models are computationally expensive, limiting their use in ensemble forecasting and climate simulations.

Method: GenSIM is a generative AI model trained on long simulations from a state-of-the-art sea-ice-ocean system. It predicts sea ice evolution driven solely by atmospheric forcings and appears to have learned an internal ocean emulator.

Result: The model robustly reproduces statistics from numerical models and observations, showing brittle-like short-term dynamics while depicting long-term sea-ice decline. It demonstrates emergent extrapolation capabilities by inferring slowly evolving climate dynamics from short-term predictions.

Conclusion: GenSIM shows large potential for generative models to generalize for unseen climates and encode hidden physics, representing a significant advancement in efficient and accurate sea ice prediction.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

TL;DR: AI weather models underperform traditional numerical models for extreme weather events, consistently showing larger errors for record-breaking heat, cold, and wind across all forecast lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI-based models have shown superior performance in general weather forecasting, their ability to reliably forecast unprecedented extreme events remains uncertain, which is critical for high-stakes applications like early warning systems.

Method: Comparative analysis of state-of-the-art AI models (GraphCast, Pangu-Weather, Fuxi) against the numerical model HRES from ECMWF for record-breaking weather extremes including heat, cold, and wind events.

Result: HRES consistently outperformed all AI models for record-breaking extremes. AI models showed larger forecast errors, underestimated frequency and intensity of record events, underpredicted hot records, and overestimated cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedances.

Conclusion: Current AI weather models have limitations in extrapolating beyond their training domain and forecasting impactful record-breaking events, indicating they cannot yet be solely relied upon for critical applications in a warming climate.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

TL;DR: Comprehensive survey of Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) on MLaaS platforms, covering attack techniques, defense strategies, and proposing a novel taxonomy with implications for AI security and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLaaS platforms provide accessible ML capabilities but introduce vulnerabilities through Model Extraction Attacks that can replicate proprietary models, threatening intellectual property, privacy, and security.

Method: Proposes a novel taxonomy classifying MEAs by attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Analyzes various attack techniques, evaluates effectiveness, and assesses defense trade-offs between utility and security.

Result: Systematic survey covering technical aspects of MEAs, their effectiveness, challenges in defense strategies, and implications across computing paradigms. Includes ongoing online repository for related literature.

Conclusion: MEAs pose significant threats to MLaaS platforms requiring balanced security approaches. The survey serves as valuable reference for researchers and practitioners, highlighting future research directions in AI security and privacy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated

TL;DR: RAGAN framework uses multimodal foundation models and in-context learning to generate high-quality fake user profiles with textual reviews for effective black-box poisoning attacks on recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, but existing methods struggle with generating high-quality fake profiles that are both effective and imperceptible under practical constraints with limited system knowledge.

Method: Proposes RAGAN framework that enhances review text quality using multimodal foundation models with in-context learning, demonstration retrieval, and text style transfer. Uses a jailbreaker with collaborative optimization between instructional agent and guardian to improve transferability and imperceptibility.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show RAGAN achieves state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance, demonstrating superior effectiveness in manipulating recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed RAGAN framework successfully addresses the challenge of generating high-quality fake user profiles for practical black-box attacks on recommender systems, providing insights into system robustness.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MoEcho discovers side channel attacks that exploit activation patterns in Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformer architectures to breach user privacy through cache occupancy, performance counters, and other hardware-level vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As MoE architectures scale for efficiency in transformers, their input-dependent expert activation patterns create hardware execution traces that adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data, revealing a new privacy attack surface.

Method: The paper introduces four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms: Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs. These are exploited through four specific attacks targeting MoE-based LLMs and VLMs.

Result: MoEcho successfully demonstrates privacy breaches through Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack, showing that hardware execution traces can reveal sensitive user inputs and outputs.

Conclusion: This work presents the first runtime architecture-level security analysis of MoE structures, highlighting serious security and privacy threats that require effective safeguards when deploying MoE-based models for large-scale AI services.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IPIGuard is a new defense against Indirect Prompt Injection attacks that models agent task execution as traversal over a Tool Dependency Graph, decoupling planning from external data interaction to prevent malicious tool invocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent defenses rely on prompting strategies or detection models that assume inherent model security, leaving agents vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that bypass security guardrails through injected instructions in tool responses.

Method: Proposes IPIGuard which models agent task execution as traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG), explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data to reduce unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions.

Result: Experiments on AgentDojo benchmark show IPIGuard achieves superior balance between effectiveness and robustness against IPI attacks.

Conclusion: IPIGuard enhances robustness against Indirect Prompt Injection attacks and paves the way for safer agentic systems in dynamic environments by preventing malicious tool invocations at the source through structural constraints.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox benchmark reveals widespread vulnerability of LLM agents to Tool Poisoning attacks through malicious tool metadata, with attack success rates up to 72.8% and existing safety alignments proving ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) creates novel attack surfaces through untrusted external tools. While prior work focused on attacks through tool outputs, this paper investigates Tool Poisoning where malicious instructions are embedded in tool metadata without execution, which lacks systematic evaluation.

Method: Introduces MCPTox benchmark built on 45 real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. Uses three attack templates to generate 1312 malicious test cases via few-shot learning, covering 10 risk categories. Evaluates 20 prominent LLM agents.

Result: Widespread vulnerability found with o1-mini achieving 72.8% attack success rate. More capable models are more susceptible. Agents rarely refuse attacks (highest refusal rate <3% with Claude-3.7-Sonnet), showing existing safety alignment is ineffective.

Conclusion: Findings establish crucial empirical baseline for understanding and mitigating Tool Poisoning threats. MCPTox is released for developing verifiably safer AI agents, demonstrating that current safety measures fail against malicious use of legitimate tools.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

TL;DR: NetSight is a supervised anomaly detection framework that automatically adapts to distribution shifts in network data using pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation, achieving up to 11.72% F1-score improvement over manual labeling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts in network data challenge existing anomaly detection systems - supervised methods require costly manual labeling while unsupervised methods need clean data, both difficult to obtain in practice.

Method: NetSight uses a novel pseudo-labeling technique to eliminate manual intervention and employs knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting in online distribution shift scenarios.

Result: Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight demonstrates superior adaptation performance with F1-score improvements of up to 11.72% compared to state-of-the-art methods requiring manual labeling.

Conclusion: NetSight proves robust and effective for dynamic networks experiencing distribution shifts over time, offering automated adaptation without manual intervention while maintaining detection performance.

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BadFU: First backdoor attack exploiting federated unlearning where malicious clients use camouflage samples to inject backdoors through legitimate unlearning requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns require machine unlearning in federated learning, but this introduces unexplored security risks where adversaries can compromise model integrity through unlearning processes.

Method: Proposed BadFU attack where malicious clients train global model with backdoor and camouflage samples during federated training, then request unlearning of camouflage samples to trigger backdoor activation.

Result: Extensive experiments show BadFU successfully injects backdoors across various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies, demonstrating critical vulnerability in current federated unlearning practices.

Conclusion: Federated unlearning introduces serious security risks requiring urgent development of more secure and robust mechanisms to prevent backdoor attacks through unlearning requests.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

*Zhiqiang Que,Chang Sun,Sudarshan Paramesvaran,Emyr Clement,Katerina Karakoulaki,Christopher Brown,Lauri Laatu,Arianna Cox,Alexander Tapper,Wayne Luk,Maria Spiropulu*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: JEDI-linear is a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that enables efficient FPGA deployment for jet tagging at the HL-LHC, achieving sub-60ns latency without DSP blocks while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs and Interaction Networks face computational complexity and irregular memory access challenges that make them difficult to deploy on FPGAs for hardware trigger systems with strict latency and resource constraints at the HL-LHC.

Method: Proposed JEDI-linear architecture eliminates explicit pairwise interactions using shared transformations and global aggregation. Implemented fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic.

Result: Achieves 3.7-11.5x lower latency, up to 150x lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2x lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs. Eliminates DSP blocks entirely (vs. 8,700+ DSPs in other solutions) while delivering higher model accuracy. First interaction-based GNN to achieve <60ns latency.

Conclusion: JEDI-linear enables accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference for real-time trigger systems, meeting HL-LHC CMS Level-1 requirements and advancing next-generation trigger systems with open-sourced templates for broader adoption.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL demonstrates significant performance gains and practical usability for addressing query ambiguity in Text-to-SQL systems, making LLM-based approaches more reliable for non-expert users.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this

### [309] [An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423)
*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation (KD) effectively compresses large pre-trained language models for code understanding tasks, with feature-based KD methods achieving 98% teacher performance using only 5% parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large pre-trained language models for code understanding faces computational intensity and inference latency challenges, requiring efficient compression techniques.

Method: Systematic investigation of logit-based and feature-based KD methods across eight student models and two teacher PLMs on three downstream code understanding tasks.

Result: KD consistently boosts performance across student models, with code-specific PLMs being better teachers and feature-based KD achieving near-teacher performance with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is highly effective for code understanding, with architecture similarity not being crucial for success, opening promising directions for efficient code model deployment.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

### [310] [A U-Statistic-based random forest approach for genetic interaction study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14924)
*Ming Li,Ruo-Sin Peng,Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Proposes Forest U-Test, a U-Statistic-based random forest method for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in quantitative trait genetic studies, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions due to exponentially increasing feature space and computational demands, especially when many genetic variants and environmental factors are involved.

Method: Developed a U-Statistic-based random forest approach called Forest U-Test for genetic association studies with quantitative traits, using recursive partitioning to handle high-dimensional data.

Result: Simulation studies showed Forest U-Test outperformed existing methods. Applied to Cannabis Dependence study, detected significant joint association (p < 0.001) and replicated findings in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17.

Conclusion: Forest U-Test provides an effective solution for detecting complex genetic interactions in high-dimensional data, demonstrating strong performance and replicability in real-world genetic association studies.

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

*Manuel Serna-Aguilera,Fiona L. Goggin,Aranyak Goswami,Alexander Bucksch,Suxing Liu,Khoa Luu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper presents AGP Dataset - a multi-modal dataset linking gene expression with phenotypic traits in Arabidopsis thaliana to address the genome-to-phenome mapping challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets either capture only genetic information or only phenotype data, and they lack integration, limiting machine learning models' ability to learn accurate gene-trait associations.

Method: Created a curated multi-modal dataset (AGP) that links gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens, and benchmarked conventional regression and biologically-informed hypergraph baselines.

Result: AGP is the first dataset providing multi-modal gene information and heterogeneous trait data for the same Arabidopsis specimens, supporting phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning tasks.

Conclusion: The AGP Dataset aims to foster research community efforts in accurately understanding genotype-phenotype connections using integrated multi-modal data from various sources.

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

*Mengze Wang,Benedikt Barthel Sorensen,Themistoklis Sapsis*

TL;DR: GEN2 is a generative prediction-correction framework that combines Gaussian emulation with ML correction to efficiently forecast extreme climate event statistics across various emissions scenarios, enabling accurate extrapolation beyond training data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Earth System Models are computationally expensive for generating large ensembles needed to quantify climate extreme risks across multiple emissions scenarios, requiring more efficient approaches.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) Conditional Gaussian emulator for prediction, 2) Non-Gaussian machine learning correction trained on reference data and emulated fields nudged toward reference to ensure robustness to chaos.

Result: Validated on historical ERA5 data and demonstrated extrapolation capabilities on future climate scenarios. Model accurately predicts extreme event statistics in different scenarios when trained on single realization of one warming scenario.

Conclusion: GEN2 successfully enables efficient and accurate forecasting of extreme climate event statistics, with strong extrapolation capabilities beyond training data distributions for various climate change scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

TL;DR: Proposes row-column hybrid grouping for fault tolerance and ILP-based compiler for analog IMC systems, achieving 8% accuracy improvement, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational unreliability from stuck-at faults and high compilation overhead in analog In-Memory Computing systems that limit scalability and deployability.

Method: 1) Multi-bit weight representation with row-column hybrid grouping for structural redundancy 2) Compiler pipeline reformulating fault-aware weight decomposition as Integer Linear Programming problem 3) Theoretical insights to identify trivial solutions for faster computation

Result: 8%p accuracy improvement, 150x faster compilation, 2x energy efficiency gain on convolutional networks and small language models compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively overcomes scalability and deployability limitations in analog IMC systems by enhancing fault tolerance and significantly reducing compilation overhead.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

### [316] [AI Testing Should Account for Sophisticated Strategic Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14927)
*Vojtech Kovarik,Eric Olav Chen,Sami Petersen,Alexis Ghersengorin,Vincent Conitzer*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: AI evaluations must account for strategic reasoning in AI systems, and game theory can help design better safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI testing methods may fail to capture deployment behavior because they don't consider that AI systems can understand their circumstances and act strategically during evaluations.

Method: The paper uses examples from existing AI systems, reviews relevant research, and conducts formal strategic analysis of a stylized evaluation scenario to support its claims.

Result: Evidence is presented showing that evaluations that ignore strategic reasoning may produce misleading results about how AI systems will behave in real deployment.

Conclusion: AI testing frameworks need to incorporate game-theoretic analysis to account for strategic behavior, and several research directions are motivated to improve evaluation design for safety cases.

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR: A lightweight object detection model for real-time driver fatigue detection that combines CNN and Transformer features with improved spatial localization, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue detection is crucial for road safety, but existing methods are either intrusive (physiological/vehicle-based) or have limitations in detecting small/occluded objects (vision-based). There's a need for non-intrusive, robust real-time detection systems.

Method: Proposes YOLO11-CR with two novel modules: 1) Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) integrating local CNN features with global Transformer context, and 2) Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM) capturing horizontal/vertical contextual information for better spatial localization, especially for profile faces and small objects.

Result: Achieved 87.17% precision, 83.86% recall, 88.09% mAP@50, and 55.93% mAP@50-95 on DSM dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of both CAFM and RCM modules.

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR provides a practical high-performance solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring with strong real-world deployment potential. Future work includes temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

### [2] [MIRAGE: Towards AI-Generated Image Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13223)
*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage-R1 is a vision-language model with reflective reasoning that achieves state-of-the-art performance for detecting AI-generated images in real-world scenarios, outperforming existing detectors by 5-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images pose significant threats to information security and public trust, but existing detectors fail to generalize from clean lab settings to noisy real-world scenarios with varied generative models and post-editing.

Method: Created Mirage benchmark from internet-sourced AIGI verified by experts and synthesized datasets. Developed Mirage-R1 with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, trained via supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning, using inference-time adaptive thinking for speed-performance balance.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mirage-R1 leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% on the Mirage benchmark and 10% on public benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in real-world AIGI detection.

Conclusion: The proposed Mirage benchmark and Mirage-R1 model effectively address the challenge of in-the-wild AI-generated image detection, providing robust performance through reflective reasoning and adaptive inference strategies.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced framework that combines vision-language models with expert OCR tools to reduce hallucinations and improve document image parsing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from hallucinations and underperform expert OCR models on domain-specific tasks, requiring a solution that leverages both general capabilities and specialized expertise.

Method: A reasoning-and-tool interleaved framework where the VLM first recognizes content using its own OCR capabilities, then calls expert models for reference results, and finally rethinks the reasoning process to provide final recognition.

Result: Outperforms both non-reasoning VLMs and expert OCR models on ReST and OmniDocBench benchmarks, demonstrating effective hallucination reduction and performance improvement.

Conclusion: The reasoning-enhanced framework successfully mitigates hallucinations and enhances OCR performance by combining VLM capabilities with specialized expert models in a cost-effective manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

### [4] [Exploration of Deep Learning Based Recognition for Urdu Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13245)
*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CNN-based approach for Urdu OCR using component classification and hierarchical neural networks achieves 99% accuracy on ligature recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu's cursive script and complex structure make traditional segmentation-based OCR error-prone, requiring a component-based approach with automatic feature learning.

Method: Used convolutional neural networks trained on Urdu text dataset generated through character permutations, with connected component technique to isolate ligatures and hierarchical neural network for classification.

Result: Achieved 0.99% (likely 99%) accuracy for component classification, demonstrating high effectiveness in Urdu character recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-based component classification approach successfully addresses Urdu's complex script challenges and provides an effective alternative to segmentation-based methods.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE is a curriculum learning framework that improves ulcerative colitis severity classification by accounting for label noise and ordinal structure, using image quality as a proxy for annotation confidence and combining with ResizeMix augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) classification is challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the score that standard models often ignore.

Method: Proposes CLoE framework that uses image quality (estimated via BBPS labels) as proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy to hard, combined with ResizeMix augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves 82.5% accuracy and QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC dataset with ConvNeXt-Tiny, consistently outperforming supervised and self-supervised baselines on both LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware training strategies like CLoE show strong potential for improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter is a diffusion-based framework that generates realistic gait silhouette sequences to address data scarcity in gait recognition while preserving privacy through controllable synthesis and novel identity generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition faces limitations due to lack of large-scale labeled datasets and privacy concerns in collecting diverse gait samples from real individuals.

Method: Trains a video diffusion model from scratch exclusively on gait silhouette data, enabling generation of temporally consistent sequences controllable by covariates like clothing, view angle, and carried objects.

Result: Synthetic samples improve gait recognition performance, especially under challenging conditions. Novel identities generated through identity embedding interpolation exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns useful for training while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: GaitCrafter demonstrates successful application of diffusion models for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation, advancing the field of biometric identification.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view vision-language models in autonomous driving that reduces computational overhead by selectively pruning visual tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving face significant computational overhead from processing high-resolution multi-view images, which creates inference latency and memory consumption issues due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.

Method: Proposes two innovations: 1) diversity-aware token selection using farthest point sampling for semantic and spatial coverage, and 2) view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios per camera view based on task importance.

Result: Achieves 6.40× speedup in prefilling phase and consumes only 13.4% of original FLOPs when retaining 10% of visual tokens, with only 3% performance drop on DriveLM benchmark.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive provides an effective plug-and-play solution for reducing computational overhead in multi-view VLMs for autonomous driving without requiring model retraining or attention map access.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a differentiable meta-attack framework that combines existing Lp-based attacks to generate perceptually aligned adversarial examples with superior visual quality and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Lp-norm bounded adversarial examples often fail to align with human perception, and it's unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained attacks can improve perceptual efficacy.

Method: Multi-stage framework that aggregates candidate adversarial examples from multiple base attacks using learned adaptive weights, guided by a meta-loss function that minimizes both misclassification loss and perceptual distortion.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual attacks (20.63% improvement in success rate) with superior visual quality metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, FID improvements of ~11, 0.015, and 5.7 respectively) across multiple datasets and defenses.

Conclusion: DAASH provides a practical and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted adaptive attacks for each new defense, demonstrating effective generalization to unseen defenses.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

### [9] [Automated Assessment of Aesthetic Outcomes in Facial Plastic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13363)
*Pegah Varghaei,Kiran Abraham-Aggarwal,Manoj T. Abraham,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer-vision framework for quantifying facial plastic surgery outcomes using automated landmark detection, symmetry analysis, age estimation, and nasal morphology on the largest curated dataset of pre/post-operative facial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide objective, quantitative evaluation of aesthetic outcomes in facial plastic surgery, enabling data-driven surgical planning and outcome assessment across different practices.

Method: Leverages automated landmark detection, geometric facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal morphology analysis on a dataset of 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients with paired pre/post-operative images.

Result: 96.2% of rhinoplasty patients showed improvement in nasal measurements; significant improvements in alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%); 71.3% showed enhanced facial symmetry or perceived age; patient identity consistency maintained with 99.5-99.6% True Match Rates.

Conclusion: The framework provides reproducible quantitative benchmarks for objective outcome evaluation, facilitating data-driven surgical planning and patient counseling across practices.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

*Yiting Wang,Ziwei Wang,Jiachen Zhong,Di Zhu,Weiyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Small language models with optimized prompts can achieve competitive accuracy in medical imaging classification, offering a practical alternative to large language models in healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face adoption barriers in healthcare due to high computational costs, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns, creating a need for more practical solutions.

Method: Evaluated multiple small language models on NIH Chest X-ray dataset for classifying AP vs. PA positions using three prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts.

Result: Certain small language models achieved competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, demonstrating that prompt engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering enables small language models to perform effectively in healthcare applications without requiring deep AI expertise, making them viable alternatives to large models in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in multiple-choice VQA benchmarks where VLMs can answer correctly using only vision and options without questions, due to visual relevance imbalance. The authors propose GroundAttack to generate hard negative options and create EOB-free datasets for more realistic VLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-choice VQA benchmarks contain a bias that allows vision-language models to select correct answers without understanding the questions, undermining the evaluation of true VQA capabilities.

Method: The authors conduct grounding experiments to identify the bias, then develop GroundAttack - a toolkit that automatically generates visually plausible hard negative options to balance visual relevance between correct and incorrect choices.

Result: When applied to NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, the EOB-free annotations cause current VLMs to drop to near-random accuracy under vision+options settings and show non-saturated performance under full question+vision+options settings.

Conclusion: The proposed GroundAttack effectively eliminates the Easy-Options Bias, creating more challenging benchmarks that provide realistic evaluation of VLMs' true visual question answering abilities beyond shortcut learning.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the

for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge distillation framework using structured prompting with large VLMs (GPT-4o and o3-mini) to train a compact 3B-scale VISTA model for highway scene understanding and traffic risk assessment, achieving strong performance with efficient edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches struggle with scalability and generalization in complex real-world traffic environments. There's a need for robust traffic risk inference and scene understanding that can operate efficiently without extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Method: Uses structured Chain-of-Thought prompting with two large VLMs to generate knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations, which are then used for supervised fine-tuning of a smaller 3B-scale student model (VISTA). The framework enables automatic generation of traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments.

Result: VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) comparable to its teacher models, despite significantly reduced parameter count. The compact model can understand low-resolution traffic videos and generate semantically faithful, risk-aware captions.

Conclusion: Effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities, enabling efficient deployment on edge devices for real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

### [14] [EDTalk++: Full Disentanglement for Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13442)
*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++ is a novel framework for controllable talking head generation that enables full disentanglement of facial motions (mouth, pose, eyes, expression) and works with both video and audio inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack proper disentanglement of facial features, causing mutual interference between different motions and inability to share visual priors across different input modalities like video and audio.

Method: Uses four lightweight modules to decompose facial dynamics into four distinct latent spaces with learnable orthogonal bases. Employs efficient training strategy without external knowledge and stores bases in banks for shared visual priors. Includes Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven synthesis.

Result: The framework successfully achieves independent manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional expression while accommodating both video and audio input modalities.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ provides a comprehensive solution for disentangled facial motion control and cross-modal compatibility, enhancing talking head generation applications.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: Kidney stone classification is crucial for personalized treatment but current CNN-based approaches struggle with long-range dependencies and variable imaging conditions.

Method: Comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models (ResNet50) on two ex vivo datasets with CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images, using ImageNet-21k pretrained ViT-base model.

Result: ViT consistently outperformed ResNet50 across all conditions: 95.2% accuracy vs 64.5% in complex endoscopic images, and 87.1% vs 78.4% in mixed-view CCD images, with similar improvements in precision and recall.

Conclusion: ViT-based architectures provide superior classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural

capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR proposes parameter-sharing across intermediate layers of implicit neural representations to efficiently encode multiple images while maintaining performance, reducing parameters by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implicit neural representations use separate neural networks for each image, leading to computational and storage inefficiencies when handling multiple images.

Method: Share intermediate layers across multiple images while keeping input/output layers image-specific, plus adding novel projection layers to capture unique features per image.

Result: Saves up to 60% parameters while maintaining comparable performance, scales to 100 images with average PSNR of 34 dB, and proves robust across various backbones.

Conclusion: MINR provides an efficient parameter-sharing framework for multi-image encoding with implicit neural representations, significantly reducing computational costs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

*Wenyong Zhou,Jiachen Ren,Taiqiang Wu,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHQ is a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization scheme that quantizes both weights and activations in Implicit Neural Representations, achieving significant hardware efficiency gains while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) require full-precision computation which causes significant hardware overhead. Previous quantization methods only focused on weights, offering limited hardware savings due to lack of activation quantization.

Method: Proposed DHQ scheme uses Hadamard transformation to standardize diverse weight and activation distributions into a unified bell-shaped form before applying standard quantization, enabling effective quantization of both weights and activations.

Result: DHQ reduces latency by 32.7%, energy consumption by 40.1%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3% compared to full-precision counterparts while outperforming previous quantization methods on image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The DHQ approach successfully addresses the hardware inefficiency of INRs by enabling comprehensive quantization of both weights and activations through distribution standardization, making INRs more practical for hardware deployment.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights

regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks

Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to short duration and low intensity. Current deep learning methods struggle to extract fine-grained spatiotemporal features effectively.

Method: Proposes FAMNet - a fusion model with 2D CNN AMNet2D and 3D CNN AMNet3D using ResNet18 backbone and attention modules. Uses multi-task learning with MER and facial action unit detection, parameter hard sharing, and different data loading methods for 2D/3D networks.

Result: Achieves 83.75% UAR and 84.03% UF1 on SAMM, CASME II, MMEW datasets. On challenging CAS(ME)^3 dataset: 51% UAR and 43.42% UF1, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-task learning framework with hierarchical attention effectively extracts omni-directional features and significantly improves micro-expression recognition performance across multiple challenging datasets.

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-view clustering performance by addressing the overlooked aspect of cluster-oriented representation learning and better exploiting consistency and complementarity between multi-view features.

Method: Three-module framework: 1) Multi-view instance learning with reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning, 2) Bi-level decoupling of features and clusters, 3) Consistency learning treating different views and neighbors as positive pairs for clustering assignment consistency.

Result: Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed BDCL framework effectively enhances inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness, achieving superior performance in multi-view clustering tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptiveAE is a reinforcement learning method that optimizes shutter speed and ISO selection for HDR imaging, addressing motion blur and noise issues in dynamic scenes through adaptive exposure scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDR techniques fail to properly handle the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO, and often overlook motion blur effects in dynamic scenes, leading to suboptimal image quality with noise and blur artifacts.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to optimize shutter speed and ISO combinations, integrates motion blur and noise simulation in training, leverages semantic information and exposure histograms, and adaptively selects optimal exposure sequences within user-defined time budgets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior HDR reconstruction quality compared to traditional solutions by finding better exposure schedules.

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE effectively addresses the limitations of conventional HDR methods by intelligently optimizing exposure parameters through reinforcement learning, resulting in significantly improved image quality in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubles matches are more common in international tournaments but understudied due to data availability and multi-person tracking challenges, creating a research gap compared to singles analysis.

Method: Extracted keypoints from singles dataset using ViT-Pose, embedded through contrastive learning with ST-GCN, incorporated custom multi-object tracking algorithm to resolve ID switching, and used Transformer-based classifier for shot recognition.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, successfully handling fast and overlapping player movements.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for doubles-specific datasets and analytics, enabling better understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of badminton.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ is a novel image tokenizer that uses 2D Gaussians to better capture geometric structures, outperforming traditional quantization methods like VQ-GAN in reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization-based tokenizers like VQ-GAN focus primarily on appearance features (texture, color) and neglect geometric structures due to their patch-based design, limiting their ability to model structured visual information.

Method: Proposed Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ) framework that integrates 2D Gaussians into visual codebook quantization, encoding image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions that model structure-related parameters like position, rotation, and scale.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with rFID score of 0.556 and PSNR of 24.93 on ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods. Higher density of 2D Gaussians further improves reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: VGQ successfully addresses limitations of traditional quantization methods by explicitly modeling geometric structures, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness, and achieving superior reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

*Yanbiao Ma,Wei Dai,Bowei Liu,Jiayi Chen,Wenke Huang,Guancheng Wan,Zhiwu Lu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometric shapes of foundation model features show remarkable transferability across domains. This geometric knowledge is used to calibrate distributions in federated learning and long-tailed recognition, overcoming data heterogeneity and sample imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between observed training samples and true distribution caused by sampling bias and noise, particularly in the context of foundation models.

Method: Leverage off-the-shelf vision foundation models (CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, then use geometric knowledge of feature distributions to guide distribution calibration. In federated learning: acquire global geometric shape under privacy constraints to generate new samples. In long-tailed learning: transfer geometric knowledge from sample-rich to sample-scarce categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the framework effectively overcomes information deficits from data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometric knowledge from foundation model features provides a powerful and transferable approach for distribution calibration in challenging learning scenarios like federated learning and long-tailed recognition.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Traditional deep learning models outperform vision-language models on facial emotion recognition tasks with low-quality images, with EfficientNet-B0 achieving 86.44% accuracy vs CLIP's 64.07% and Phi-3.5 Vision's 51.66%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of emerging vision-language models against established deep learning models for facial emotion recognition, particularly in challenging low-resolution and noisy image conditions.

Method: Empirical comparison using FER-2013 dataset (35,887 grayscale images, 7 emotion classes) with novel pipeline integrating GFPGAN-based image restoration and comprehensive evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and computational cost analysis.

Result: Traditional models significantly outperformed VLMs - EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%), ResNet-50 (85.72%) vs CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%). VLMs showed limitations in handling low-quality visual data.

Conclusion: VLMs require adaptation for noisy environments; traditional deep learning models remain superior for low-quality facial emotion recognition tasks, providing a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAvatar is a novel 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction that improves expression modeling and texture continuity through sparse expression control and 3D priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity in highly deformable regions, limiting their effectiveness for realistic head avatar reconstruction.

Method: Proposes a sparse expression control mechanism using key Gaussians to influence neighboring deformations, and leverages high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models for reliable facial geometry guidance.

Result: Experimental results show the method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Conclusion: EAvatar successfully addresses limitations in current 3DGS approaches by combining expression-aware and deformation-aware techniques with structural guidance from 3D priors, achieving superior head avatar reconstruction quality.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

*Sukhun Ko,Dahyeon Kye,Kyle Min,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR introduces frequency- and locality-aware implicit neural representations with RC-GAUSS activation and wavelet-energy-guided encoding to address spectral bias and improve signal representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit neural representations lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to spectral bias and difficulty capturing high-frequency details.

Method: Proposes FLAIR with two innovations: RC-GAUSS activation for frequency selection and spatial localization under time-frequency uncertainty principle, and Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding using discrete wavelet transform to guide frequency information.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation/restoration and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FLAIR effectively addresses limitations of current implicit neural representations by incorporating frequency awareness and spatial localization, achieving superior performance across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeProphet is a software-only gaze prediction system for VR that eliminates need for expensive eye tracking hardware, achieving 3.83° median angular error and 24% improvement over saliency baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foveated rendering requires expensive hardware eye tracking systems, limiting adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility issues.

Method: Combines Spherical Vision Transformer for 360-degree scene processing with LSTM-based temporal encoder for gaze patterns, using multi-modal fusion to integrate spatial and temporal features with confidence estimates.

Result: Achieves 3.83° median angular error, outperforms traditional saliency-based methods by 24%, maintains consistent performance across regions/scenes, and provides reliable confidence calibration.

Conclusion: Software-only gaze prediction is viable for VR foveated rendering, making performance improvements accessible across VR platforms without additional hardware requirements.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

*Zihan Zhang,Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight GFVC framework with dual-mode optimization achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving while maintaining superior perceptual quality compared to VVC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) has superior rate-distortion performance but faces practical deployment challenges due to large model parameters and high computational costs, hindering use in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Dual-mode optimization combining architectural redesign (replacing 3x3 convolutions with slimmer layers) and operational refinement (two-stage adaptive channel pruning with soft pruning during training and hard pruning post-training using learnable thresholds and derived masks).

Result: Achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation saving compared to baseline, while maintaining superior performance over VVC in perceptual-level quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight dual-mode optimization enables efficient GFVC deployment in resource-constrained environments like mobile edge devices by significantly reducing complexity while preserving reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

*Hsieh Ching-Teng,Wang Yuan-Kai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuron-like encoding method with artificial photoreceptor layer generates biologically-inspired spike data that carries both color and luminance information, improving SNN performance while maintaining neuromorphic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag behind CNNs due to limited information capacity of spike-based data, and existing approaches using non-spiking inputs deviate from neuromorphic computing's original intent of spike-based processing.

Method: Proposed a neuron-like encoding method that generates spike data based on biological neuron principles, enhanced with an artificial photoreceptor layer to carry color and luminance information.

Result: Experimental results with Integrate-and-Fire neuron model show increased information content in spike signals and improved SNN performance while adhering to neuromorphic principles.

Conclusion: This biologically-inspired approach has strong potential for overcoming current SNN limitations and facilitating broader neuromorphic computing applications.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

### [35] [DictAS: A Framework for Class-Generalizable Few-Shot Anomaly Segmentation via Dictionary Lookup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13560)
*Zhen Qu,Xian Tao,Xinyi Gong,ShiChen Qu,Xiaopei Zhang,Xingang Wang,Fei Shen,Zhengtao Zhang,Mukesh Prasad,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS is a novel framework for few-shot anomaly segmentation that uses dictionary lookup capabilities to detect anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for anomaly segmentation rely on prior knowledge of real anomaly samples and training on seen classes, limiting cross-category generalization. The goal is to create a unified model that can detect anomalies in unseen categories using only a few normal reference images.

Method: DictAS uses self-supervised learning with three main components: (1) Dictionary Construction - simulates dictionary index/content using normal reference image features, (2) Dictionary Lookup - retrieves queried region features via sparse lookup strategy (unretrievable features are anomalies), (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - enhances anomaly discrimination through Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DictAS framework successfully transfers dictionary lookup capabilities to anomaly segmentation tasks, enabling effective detection of visual anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining, representing a significant advancement in few-shot anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify replaces iterative optimization in SMPLify with neural regression for 200x faster 3D human pose estimation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify's high computational cost limits practicality, while neural networks have shown runtime improvements without accuracy loss in other domains.

Method: Neural framework using temporal sampling for data construction, human-centric normalization, and residual learning to replace iterative fitting with single-pass regression.

Result: 200x faster runtime than SMPLify, good generalization on 3DPW and RICH datasets, and effective as plug-in tool on LucidAction.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify provides a practical, fast baseline for 3D human pose estimation that works in both sequential and plug-in modes with model-agnostic capabilities.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a generative attention-based model that learns feature semantics relations by leveraging foreground-background differences, improving video action analysis for IoT applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video action analysis methods overlook feature semantics and focus on action proposal optimization, making them unsuitable for high-performance IoT applications like autonomous driving that require precision and scalability.

Method: A novel generative attention-based model that simultaneously learns frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature semantics by leveraging differences between actions' foreground and background.

Result: Extensive experiments on action recognition and action detection benchmarks show superior performance, with comprehensive validation on widely recognized datasets confirming the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively utilizes feature semantics in feature extraction, providing a robust and scalable solution for intelligent video analytics in high-performance IoT applications.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

TL;DR: A new RVOS model that improves segmentation head design, integrates diffusion features without noise prediction, and adds a Temporal Context Mask Refinement module to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent RVOS approaches focus too much on feature extraction and temporal modeling while neglecting segmentation head design, leaving room for improvement in boundary segmentation capability.

Method: Proposes Temporal-Conditional RVOS model that integrates existing segmentation methods, uses text-to-video diffusion for feature extraction (removing noise prediction module), and adds Temporal Context Mask Refinement module to overcome VAE limitations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public RVOS benchmarks with improved segmentation quality and simplified model architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses segmentation head design limitations in RVOS, demonstrating that careful integration of diffusion features and refinement modules can significantly boost performance without complex designs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems perform poorly in adverse weather conditions due to underrepresentation in training datasets, and collecting/annotating real adverse weather data is prohibitively expensive.

Method: Developed multiple data-generation pipelines including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches. Extended existing DA GAN with auxiliary inputs, created training recipe using both simulated and real images, and introduced adaptive blending method to reduce hallucinations in Stable-Diffusion outputs.

Result: Achieved 1.85% overall improvement in semantic segmentation and 4.62% improvement specifically on nighttime conditions when evaluated on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC).

Conclusion: The hybrid diffusion-GAN approach effectively bridges the simulation-to-real gap and enables robust autonomous driving perception in adverse weather conditions without requiring expensive real data collection.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

*Jinyoung Park,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe is a token-merging strategy specifically designed for State Space Models in vision tasks that uses state transition parameters to measure token importance and preserves sequential information flow, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs across image, video, and audio domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving computational efficiency of State Space Models (SSMs) in computer vision is crucial for practical deployment. While token reduction is effective for efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposes MaMe, a token-merging strategy that leverages state transition parameter Δ as an informativeness measure for quantifying token importance and introduces strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow in SSM-based vision models.

Result: Extensive experiments show MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. It maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where existing methods degrade significantly. Shows strong generalization across video and audio domains.

Conclusion: MaMe establishes an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in diverse SSM applications, demonstrating that carefully designed token reduction strategies can preserve SSMs' sequential modeling capabilities while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

*Shiyuan Chen,Wei Sui,Bohao Zhang,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC is a novel camera-based 3D semantic scene completion framework that uses dual decoupling at source and pathway levels to separate semantic and geometric processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on coupled encoders that force trade-offs between conflicting semantic and geometric demands, limiting overall performance in 3D semantic scene completion.

Method: Proposes dual decoupling: source-level decoupling uses a foundation encoder for semantic features and stereo cost volumes; pathway-level decoupling refines priors through specialized pathways. Uses hybrid view transformation and novel Axis-Aware Fusion module for anisotropic feature merging.

Result: Achieves +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU improvements on SemanticKITTI, and state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360 with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU.

Conclusion: The dual-decoupling design effectively addresses the conflict between semantic and geometric processing, enabling simultaneous improvements in both aspects of 3D semantic scene completion.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: Current state-of-the-art talking head synthesis models fail to generalize across the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language, and age groups due to limitations in existing training data's scale, quality, and diversity.

Method: Created TalkVid dataset through a principled multi-stage automated pipeline that filters for motion stability, aesthetic quality, and facial detail, validated against human judgments. Also constructed TalkVid-Bench, a stratified evaluation set of 500 clips balanced across demographic and linguistic axes.

Result: Models trained on TalkVid outperform counterparts trained on previous datasets and exhibit superior cross-dataset generalization. Analysis on TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that traditional aggregate metrics obscure.

Conclusion: TalkVid addresses critical data limitations in talking head synthesis and provides a necessary benchmark for evaluating model performance across diverse demographic groups, highlighting the importance of diverse training data and stratified evaluation.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel RGB-only category-level object pose estimation method using transformer-based network with geometric feature prediction and RANSAC-PnP for accurate pose estimation without depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D methods struggle in scenes lacking depth information, creating a need for reliable pose estimation using only RGB images in real-world scenarios.

Method: Transformer-based neural network predicts and fuses geometric features, enhanced by geometric feature-guided algorithm, with RANSAC-PnP for pose computation handling variable object scales.

Result: Highly efficient and achieves superior accuracy compared to previous RGB-based methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective for advancing category-level object pose estimation using only RGB images, demonstrating strong performance without depth data requirements.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

*Ao Chen,Lihe Ding,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DiffIER to address training-inference gap in diffusion models that causes sensitivity to guidance weight, using iterative error minimization during inference to improve conditional generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in diffusion models shows high sensitivity to guidance weight selection due to a training-inference gap that undermines conditional generation performance.

Method: DiffIER - an optimization-based method that performs iterative error minimization at each inference step to reduce accumulated error and mitigate the training-inference gap.

Result: Outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks and achieves consistent success across text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: The proposed plug-and-play optimization framework effectively reduces accumulated error, enhances generation quality, and demonstrates versatility for broad applications in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniTry is a unified virtual try-on framework that extends beyond clothes to any wearable objects like jewelry and accessories, using a two-stage pipeline with mask-free localization and appearance transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON works focus mainly on clothes, but there's a need for a more practical framework that can handle any wearable objects without requiring masks, with challenges in obtaining paired training data.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use unpaired images to train mask-free localization by repurposing inpainting models, 2) Fine-tune with few paired samples for object appearance consistency transfer.

Result: OmniTry outperforms existing methods on both object localization and ID-preservation across 12 classes of wearable objects, with quick convergence even with limited paired data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends virtual try-on to diverse wearable objects with practical mask-free setting, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in data usage.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: DeH4R is a hybrid model for road network extraction that combines graph-generating efficiency with graph-growing dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automated road network extraction face challenges: segmentation approaches lose topology fidelity after vectorization, graph-growing methods are computationally expensive due to iterative ROI cropping, and graph-generating methods lack dynamic vertex insertion capability.

Method: Proposes a decoupled approach with four components: candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This hybrid architecture enables dynamic vertex/edge insertions while maintaining fast inference.

Result: Outperforms prior SOTA RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale benchmark while being approximately 10x faster. Demonstrates superior topology fidelity and spatial consistency.

Conclusion: DeH4R successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining efficiency of graph-generating approaches with dynamic capabilities of graph-growing methods, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

TL;DR: HumanPCR is a comprehensive evaluation suite for multimodal models that assesses human-centric visual understanding across three hierarchical levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning, revealing significant challenges in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in multimodal models demands human-comparable performance across diverse environments, particularly in human-related visual contexts that are often overlooked by existing benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose HumanPCR with three hierarchical levels: Human-P (Perception) and Human-C (Comprehension) featuring over 6,000 human-verified multiple choice questions across 9 dimensions, and Human-R (Reasoning) with manually curated video reasoning tests requiring integration of multiple visual evidences and proactive context extraction.

Result: Extensive evaluations on over 30 state-of-the-art models show significant challenges in human-centric visual understanding, particularly in detailed space perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Models struggle with extracting proactive visual evidence and rely too heavily on query-guided retrieval, with advanced techniques providing only limited benefits.

Conclusion: HumanPCR reveals critical gaps in current multimodal models' human-centric visual understanding capabilities and provides a foundation for advancing development, evaluation, and human-centric applications of these models.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality annotated medical image data is costly to acquire. Semi-supervised methods can leverage unlabeled data, and Mamba models show promise for handling long-range dependencies in medical images.

Method: Proposes Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba (DCMamba) with: 1) patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation, 2) diverse-scan collaboration module for different scanning directions, 3) uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning for feature diversity.

Result: Significantly outperforms other semi-supervised methods, achieving 6.69% improvement over latest SSM-based method on Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: DCMamba effectively leverages Mamba's capabilities for semi-supervised medical segmentation through multi-perspective diversity enhancement, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing educational content in Metaverse for agriculture learning is challenging due to lack of datasets and effective retrieval methods for relevant virtual scenarios.

Method: Created AgriMuseums dataset with 457 agricultural virtual museums and proposed hierarchical vision-language model for natural language query-based retrieval.

Result: Achieved 62% R@1 and 78% MRR, with improvements of up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and hierarchical model effectively address agricultural Metaverse content retrieval, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [53] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA is a novel targeted adversarial attack method that targets the intermediate projector module (Q-Former) in VLMs to achieve fine-grained image manipulation while preserving background content, outperforming existing methods in both global captioning and fine-grained VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack methods collapse rich visual semantics into single global vectors, limiting attack granularity and failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline by overlooking the critical projector module.

Method: Proposes Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA) that attacks the Q-Former intermediate stage to operate on semantically meaningful visual tokens, and Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content for precise manipulations.

Result: Extensive experiments show IPGA consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box settings, with successful transfer to commercial VLMs like Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: IPGA demonstrates that attacking the intermediate projector module enables more precise and controlled adversarial manipulations while improving both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse vision-language models.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

### [54] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle to accurately identify image rotations, particularly distinguishing between 90° and 270° rotations, revealing significant gaps in spatial reasoning compared to human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in identifying image orientations, which requires robust visual reasoning to detect rotational cues and spatial relationships.

Method: Created RotBench - a 350-image benchmark with lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Tested state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro) on identifying 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations. Used auxiliary information (captions, depth maps), chain-of-thought prompting, simultaneous multi-orientation presentation, and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Most models reliably identify 0° images, some identify 180° images, but none can reliably distinguish between 90° and 270° rotations. Auxiliary information and prompting offered only small improvements. Fine-tuning improved 180° identification but not 90°/270° distinction.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in rotation identification, highlighting fundamental limitations in current multimodal models' visual reasoning abilities.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

### [55] [Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744)
*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage in LVLMs by sequentially masking images with noise and aggregating logits to improve multi-image reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models show degraded performance on multi-image tasks due to visual cue entanglement and cross-image information leakage between different input images.

Method: Proposed FOCUS strategy: sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, obtains logits for each single clean image, aggregates logits, and contrastively refines using noise-only reference to suppress information leakage.

Result: FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families, demonstrating effectiveness without additional training or architectural changes.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning capabilities in vision-language models through a training-free, architecture-agnostic decoding approach.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D is a new dataset for 6D pose estimation specifically designed for mobile robotics in industrial environments, addressing limitations of existing household-focused datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets focus on small household objects for robot arms, but mobile robots face different challenges like long-range perception, large objects, heavy occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives that current datasets overlook.

Method: The authors created MR6D dataset with 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions, capturing mobile robotics challenges including distant viewpoints, varied configurations, large object sizes, and complex occlusion patterns.

Result: Initial experiments show current 6D pose estimation pipelines underperform in these mobile robotics settings, with 2D segmentation being a particular challenge.

Conclusion: MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to mobile robotics demands, addressing the gap in existing datasets that don't account for industrial environment challenges.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [57] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method for non-rigid 3D shape registration to 2D keypoints using multiple cameras, with three approaches: direction vectors from known/unknown 3D points, and silhouette-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Shape-from-Template (SfT) from single images to multiple cameras for improved accuracy in medical imaging and hand-held camera applications.

Method: Three approaches using generalized camera model: 1) keypoints on direction vectors from known 3D points, 2) from unknown 3D points with known orientation, 3) silhouette-based iterative refinement of convex solutions.

Result: Demonstrated accuracy on synthetic and real data with improved reconstruction from multi-view constraints.

Conclusion: First solutions for SfT with generalized cameras, enabling more accurate non-rigid 3D shape registration from multiple camera views.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

### [58] [VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792)
*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw is a bilevel optimization framework that uses LLMs as physics experts to generate interpretable constitutive laws from visual observations, with visual simulation guiding the evolution process to infer intrinsic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for inferring intrinsic dynamics from visual observations either rely on manually defined priors that don't generalize well, or use neural networks that lack interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Method: A bilevel optimization framework with: 1) Upper level: LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution where LLMs act as physics experts to generate/revise laws with reduced search complexity 2) Lower level: Vision-guided constitutive evaluation using visual simulation to assess consistency with underlying dynamics

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively infers interpretable intrinsic dynamics, and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel scenarios.

Conclusion: VisionLaw successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing an interpretable, generalizable framework for inferring intrinsic dynamics from visual observations using LLMs and visual simulation guidance.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve both performance and interpretability in breast cancer ultrasound segmentation by integrating clinical radiology reports to provide clinically grounded explanations and increase confidence in computer-assisted diagnosis.

Method: Uses dual-branch visual encoder (ViT + Swin transformers) with uncertainty-aware fusion, encodes clinical language with BI-RADS semantics using BioClinicalBERT, and employs cross-modal attention to combine visual and text features for simultaneous segmentation, uncertainty mapping, and diagnostic rationale generation.

Result: Achieves 99% Dice score and 95% IoU on BUS-BRA dataset, outperforming U-Net, ViT, and Swin baselines. Shows strong multimodal alignment (CLIP score: 85%) and improved confidence calibration (ECE: 3.2%). Ablation studies demonstrate clinical text's critical role (-5.4% Dice decline without text).

Conclusion: Med-CTX sets a new standard for trustworthy multimodal medical architecture by successfully integrating clinical reports to enhance both segmentation accuracy and explainability, providing comprehensive outputs including masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA framework reduces attack latency in SNNs by up to 57% through timestep-level backpropagation and adversarial membrane potential reuse, maintaining comparable attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based attacks on SNNs suffer from high latency due to multi-timestep processing, making them impractical for real-time applications. These methods fail to exploit key SNN properties.

Method: Proposes Timestep-Compressed Attack (TCA) with two components: 1) Timestep-Level Backpropagation (TLBP) for per-timestep evaluation and early stopping, and 2) Adversarial Membrane Potential Reuse (A-MPR) to pre-calculate and reuse membrane potential warm-up phases.

Result: TCA reduces required attack latency by up to 56.6% (white-box) and 57.1% (black-box) compared to SOTA methods on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, while maintaining comparable attack success rates.

Conclusion: TCA effectively addresses the latency limitations of existing SNN attacks by leveraging SNN-specific properties, making adversarial attacks more feasible for real-time applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional field-based tree inventories are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that doesn't generalize well across regions, creating barriers for scalable urban biodiversity monitoring.

Method: Unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without requiring labeled training data.

Result: Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovered genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices while preserving spatial autocorrelation.

Conclusion: This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and provides a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive urban ecosystem management.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while

regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,

TL;DR: SA3 is a novel cross-domain object detection method that uses attention-based alignment and instance-to-image level adaptation to bridge domain gaps in intelligent transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain detection in intelligent transportation faces significant challenges due to domain shifts between source and target domains, requiring effective alignment mechanisms to maintain detection performance.

Method: Proposes Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3) with attention-based alignment module for local-global feature alignment, channel importance re-weighting, and instance-to-image level alignment specific to target domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-domain object detection benchmarks show SA3 achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SA3 effectively addresses cross-domain detection challenges through adaptive alignment mechanisms, demonstrating significant improvements in intelligent transportation detection tasks.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but often fail to precisely align with text prompts, missing critical elements or blending distinct concepts incorrectly.

Method: Proposes a novel approach that learns high-success-rate distributions conditioned on target prompts, explicitly modeling signal components during denoising to provide fine-grained control. The framework is training-free and compatible with diffusion and flow matching architectures, supporting additional conditioning like bounding boxes for spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image generation alignment and faithfulness.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses text-to-image alignment issues, providing faithful prompt reflection without training requirements, making it a practical solution for improving existing generative models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stone deterioration identification methods relying on expert teams are accurate but time-consuming and resource-intensive. There's a need for automated systems that can assist in this process while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Developed a multi-agent AI system with five specialized agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, and diagnostic coordinator) based on a cognitive architecture. The system was evaluated using 28 challenging images with multiple deterioration patterns.

Result: The system demonstrated significant improvements across all metrics compared to the foundational model, showing a huge boost in performance for identifying stone deterioration patterns.

Conclusion: The Id-Pattern multi-agent AI system provides an effective automated solution for stone pathology diagnosis that outperforms traditional approaches and foundational AI models, offering a more efficient alternative to manual expert analysis.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two realistic incremental object detection benchmarks (RICO) to address limitations of synthetic IL evaluations, showing current methods underperform and simple replay outperforms them but still lags behind individual training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incremental learning evaluations rely on synthetic benchmarks that obscure real-world performance, creating a need for more realistic benchmarks that capture domain shifts and expanding classes.

Method: Created two benchmarks: Domain RICO (fixed classes with domain shifts) and Expanding-Classes RICO (new domains and classes per step), built from 14 diverse datasets covering various real-world conditions.

Result: All IL methods underperformed in both adaptability and retention; replaying small amounts of previous data outperformed all methods but individual training remained superior.

Conclusion: The performance gap is attributed to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to handle diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity, highlighting the need for better IL approaches.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg is a novel regularization method that uses Latent Concept Representations to guide medical imaging models toward clinically meaningful features instead of spurious correlations, improving robustness without requiring dense concept labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on spurious correlations rather than clinically meaningful features, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts.

Method: Uses a small auxiliary dataset to synthesize high-quality concept examples, extracts Latent Concept Representations (LCRs) for predefined features, and incorporates a regularization term that guides CNNs to activate within concept-associated latent subspaces.

Result: Significantly improves robustness to spurious correlations in controlled tests, remains effective in multi-concept/multiclass settings, and enhances performance on diabetic retinopathy classification under synthetic perturbations and OOD generalization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LCRReg provides a lightweight, architecture-agnostic strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept supervision, outperforming multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc concept-based models.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: This study develops a ConvLSTM neural network to forecast South Asian smog events using Sentinel-5P satellite data, achieving good predictive performance for aerosol index forecasting at five-day intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: South Asian smog events cause severe air pollution with significant socio-economic impacts, but real-time forecasting systems for particulate matter concentrations are not established at regional scale, creating a need for effective prediction methods.

Method: Used Sentinel-5P air constituent data (2019-2023) with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network that captures spatial and temporal correlations, using Ultraviolet Aerosol Index at 340-380 nm as predictor.

Result: The model forecasts Aerosol Index at five-day intervals with Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of ~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74, showing effective predictive capability.

Conclusion: The ConvLSTM approach is effective for smog forecasting but can be improved by integrating additional data sources and refining the model architecture for better performance.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

*Weixin Xu,Ziliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SCRNet - a novel UNet-based framework with Feature Aggregation Module and Spatial-Channel Regulation Module that combines convolution and cross-attention to address both long-range dependencies and local context in medical ultrasound segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods ignore long-range dependencies while Transformer-based methods overlook local contextual information in medical ultrasound image segmentation, creating a need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Developed Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) with Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to process dual input features, integrated with Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM) within UNet encoder to create SCRNet framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCRNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in medical ultrasound segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SCRNet framework successfully addresses limitations of both CNN and Transformer approaches by effectively combining convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms for superior medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysGM is a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts 3D Gaussian representations and physical properties from single images, enabling fast 4D physical simulations without requiring pre-reconstructed 3DGS or unstable optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis methods rely on pre-reconstructed 3DGS representations and face limitations with inflexible physical attributes or unstable optimization-heavy guidance from video models.

Method: Joint optimization for Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction, refined with physically plausible reference videos using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to avoid complex SDS optimization. Trained on PhysAssets dataset with 24,000+ 3D assets.

Result: Generates high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute, achieving significant speedup over prior works while maintaining realistic rendering quality.

Conclusion: PhysGM provides an efficient and effective solution for physics-based 3D motion synthesis, overcoming limitations of previous methods through joint prediction and DPO optimization.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net is a unified dual-illumination enhancement framework that handles both low-light and backlit images using adaptive expert selection and damage restoration modules, achieving competitive performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single illumination degradation types and lack unified handling of diverse lighting conditions commonly encountered in real-world environments.

Method: Proposes DIME-Net with Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator using sparse gating to select S-curve expert networks, integrated with Retinex theory, plus damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention. Uses MixBL hybrid dataset for training.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without retraining, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: DIME-Net shows potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex illumination conditions with robust illumination adaptability through single training.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA: A novel face image quality assessment method using Vision Transformers with a learnable quality token that achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and face recognition models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FIQA methods primarily rely on CNNs, leaving the potential of Vision Transformer architectures underexplored for face image quality assessment tasks.

Method: Extends standard ViT backbones with a learnable quality token concatenated with image patch tokens, processed via global self-attention. Uses dual heads: one for face representation learning and another for quality score regression.

Result: Consistently achieves top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks across multiple FR models (both CNN- and ViT-based), demonstrating superior effectiveness.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures are highly effective for modeling face image utility, and ViTs show strong potential as a scalable foundation for future FIQA research.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes a new platform for advancing depth estimation research, providing a cost-efficient and diverse benchmark that highlights current limitations and supports future development of foundation models.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these

we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning strategy to determine appropriate annotation types (tags, points, scribbles, boxes, masks) for video action detection, and introduces a 3D-superpixel method to generate pseudo-labels, reducing annotation costs with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations that are challenging and expensive to obtain, while videos vary in difficulty and may not need the same level of annotation.

Method: Proposes active learning to estimate necessary annotation type per video, and novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach to generate pseudo-labels from different annotation types.

Result: Validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets, significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces annotation burden for video action detection while maintaining performance by intelligently selecting appropriate annotation types and generating pseudo-labels.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel perception system for autonomous highway driving that extends detection range to 250m using efficient 3D encoding and self-supervised learning, achieving significant improvements in object detection and LiDAR forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need longer perception ranges (250m+) for safe highway driving at high speeds and to support heavy trucks with longer braking distances, but existing BEV approaches have quadratic cost increases with distance.

Method: Built on sparse representation with efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal temporal features, plus novel self-supervised pre-training scheme using unlabeled camera-LiDAR data.

Result: 26.6% improvement in mAP for object detection and 30.5% decrease in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting, reaching 250m perception range.

Conclusion: The approach successfully overcomes range limitations of existing methods, enabling safe long-distance highway autonomy for both cars and trucks.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

TL;DR: Novel method for online 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB-only frames using adaptive view selection to improve model completeness by incorporating both keyframes and optimal non-keyframes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on keyframes which are insufficient for complete scene reconstruction, and online processing constraints limit the use of many frames or extensive training iterations.

Method: Adaptive view selection that analyzes reconstruction quality online to choose optimal non-keyframes for additional training, combined with an online multi-view stereo approach to maintain 3D consistency throughout the modeling process.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes with significantly enhanced completeness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of keyframe-only methods by intelligently selecting additional viewpoints, resulting in more complete and high-quality 3DGS models from RGB-only input.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment (NA) is a data poisoning backdoor attack method for self-supervised contrastive learning that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images by strategically manipulating random cropping to achieve superior attack performance while maintaining clean-data accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs) for contrastive learning suffer from limited efficacy due to fragile implicit co-occurrence dependencies and inadequate suppression of discriminative features in backdoored images.

Method: The method identifies and extracts the critical objective of noisy alignment from training-controllable CL attacks, adapts it to data-poisoning scenarios, and implements it by strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism as an image layout optimization problem with theoretically derived optimal parameters.

Result: Noisy Alignment achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs, maintains clean-data accuracy, and demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: The proposed Noisy Alignment method provides a simple yet effective approach for data poisoning backdoor attacks in contrastive learning by explicitly addressing noise component suppression through strategic manipulation of random cropping mechanisms.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video dubbing techniques only edit mouth regions, causing discordant facial expressions and body gestures that break viewer immersion. Need holistic full-body motion synchronization with audio.

Method: Propose InfiniteTalk - streaming audio-driven generator for infinite-length dubbing. Uses temporal context frames for seamless transitions and optimized sampling strategy with fine-grained reference frame positioning for adaptive conditioning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets. Superior visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization confirmed by quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Sparse-frame video dubbing with strategic reference frame preservation enables holistic audio-synchronized full-body animation, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches and naive image-to-video models.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods from sparse/single views produce shapes lacking geometric detail due to computational constraints, creating a need for efficient detail enhancement.

Method: Uses data-dependent flows in latent space for coarse-to-fine transformation, token matching strategy for spatial correspondence, and carefully designed training data matching synthesized coarse shape characteristics.

Result: Effectively enhances shapes from various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches (single-view to sparse multi-view inputs) with high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis.

Conclusion: Achieves efficient training while producing high-quality detailed 3D shapes, demonstrating superior performance in geometric detail enhancement across multiple generation scenarios.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Result: Achieves promising rendering results in both quality and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Distilled-3DGS is a simple yet effective framework that successfully addresses the memory/storage limitations of 3DGS while maintaining rendering fidelity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset Dense-WebVid-CoVR with 1.6M samples and dense modification text is introduced for composed video retrieval, along with a Cross-Attention fusion model that achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval frameworks struggle with fine-grained compositional queries and temporal variations in video retrieval tasks.

Method: Developed a model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention fusion using grounded text encoder for precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.

Result: Achieves 71.3% Recall@1 in visual+text setting, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.4% across all metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively handle fine-grained composed video retrieval by leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Agents (CoA) is a new LLM reasoning paradigm that enables end-to-end complex problem-solving within a single model by dynamically activating different tool and role-playing agents, trained through multi-agent distillation and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on manual prompt engineering and complex frameworks, making them computationally inefficient and unable to benefit from data-centric learning. The authors aim to create a more efficient and capable end-to-end solution.

Method: Introduces Chain-of-Agents paradigm with multi-agent distillation framework to distill multi-agent systems into trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, followed by agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable tasks to create Agent Foundation Models (AFMs).

Result: AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings.

Conclusion: The proposed Chain-of-Agents approach successfully enables efficient end-to-end complex problem-solving within single models, with open-sourced resources providing a foundation for future agent model research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace is a novel paradigm that addresses LLM context limitations by emulating human cognitive mechanisms, achieving 58.6% memory reuse vs 0% for traditional RAG with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face fundamental limitations in context management despite extended context windows. Passive retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management, lacking metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Based on cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model and Clark's extended mind thesis.

Result: Achieves average 58.6% memory reuse rate (54-60% across tasks) vs 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical significance confirmed with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple task types.

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace represents a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLM systems through a comprehensive theoretical framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEval is a unified evaluation framework for automated alpha mining that assesses alphas across five dimensions without backtesting, offering comprehensive insights and higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alpha evaluation methods are limited - backtesting is computationally intensive and parameter-sensitive, while correlation metrics overlook crucial properties like stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Closed-source models also hinder reproducibility.

Method: Proposed AlphaEval framework evaluates generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. It's parallelizable and backtest-free.

Result: Extensive experiments show AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. It effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric approaches.

Conclusion: AlphaEval addresses key limitations in alpha mining evaluation, offering a unified framework that assesses multiple crucial dimensions efficiently. The open-source implementation promotes reproducibility and community progress in quantitative finance.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the computational complexity and algorithms for fitting ontologies and constraints to relational data examples, focusing on description logics and various types of tuple-generating dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the problem of automatically constructing ontologies and constraints from positive and negative examples in the form of finite relational structures, which is important for knowledge base construction and data integration.

Method: The study examines description logics EL and ELI, along with several classes of tuple-generating dependencies (full, guarded, frontier-guarded, frontier-one, unrestricted TGDs, and inclusion dependencies). It analyzes computational complexity, designs algorithms, and investigates the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs.

Result: The paper pinpoints exact computational complexity for different ontology and constraint languages, provides algorithms for fitting, and analyzes the size of solutions. It also shows that finite bases exist for EL, ELI, guarded TGDs, and inclusion dependencies, but generally not for full, frontier-guarded, and frontier-one TGDs.

Conclusion: The research provides a comprehensive complexity analysis and algorithmic framework for ontology and constraint fitting from examples, with important distinctions between different description logics and TGD classes regarding the existence of finite bases.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

TL;DR: CESQL model integrates interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for WHERE clause parsing, using filtering adjustments and model fusion to enhance text-to-SQL accuracy on WikiSQL dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve foundational capabilities and generalization of text-to-SQL models for real-world applications by reducing dependence on condition column data and manual training labels.

Method: Combines model interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing, augmented with filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion in CESQL design.

Result: Excels on WikiSQL dataset for single-table queries, significantly boosts prediction accuracy, and minimizes reliance on condition column data and manually labeled training data.

Conclusion: Provides fresh perspectives for handling complex queries and irregular data scenarios in real-world database environments through enhanced basic query processing accuracy.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [90] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Search-time contamination (STC) is a new form of data leakage where search-based LLM agents find evaluation datasets with ground truth answers online, enabling them to copy answers rather than reason, compromising benchmark integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address a novel form of data contamination that occurs during search-based LLM agent evaluation, where agents can access test questions and answers from online sources like HuggingFace, undermining the validity of benchmark results.

Method: Analyzed search logs from LLM agents on three benchmarks (HLE, SimpleQA, GPQA), identified when agents retrieved datasets with ground truth labels from HuggingFace, conducted ablation experiments by blocking HuggingFace, and measured accuracy changes.

Result: Approximately 3% of questions were directly contaminated, with accuracy dropping ~15% on contaminated subsets when HuggingFace was blocked. Public evaluation datasets on HuggingFace are not the sole source of STC.

Conclusion: Proposed best practices for benchmark design and result reporting to address STC, and released complete experiment logs to facilitate auditing of evaluation results for search-based LLM agents.

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

TL;DR: QuickMerge is a lightweight token merging framework that dynamically reduces token computation costs for autoregressive generation by selecting tokens based on attention norms and using an entropy-based budget estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and video domains, token-level computation has become a major bottleneck. Most existing token selection methods are static, modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation.

Method: QuickMerge dynamically selects reduced tokens using attention norm magnitude guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. It introduces a lightweight transformer prior trained over merged token sequences to preserve autoregressive compatibility.

Result: QuickMerge demonstrates consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs across multi-modality domains, substantially reducing token counts while matching or exceeding performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines semantic salience estimation, flexible token budgets, and autoregressive alignment to enable accurate generation with fewer tokens, addressing the computational bottleneck in large generative models.

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience

accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI chess players sustain higher strategic tension longer than humans, with cumulative tension increasing at specific Elo thresholds (1600 and 2300) for humans, revealing different cognitive approaches between AI and human strategic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic decision-making differs between humans and AI in chess, specifically examining the trade-off between immediate opportunities and long-term objectives through quantitative analysis of strategic tension.

Method: Proposed a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to quantify strategic tension on the chess board, then analyzed its evolution in both human vs human and AI vs AI games across different skill levels.

Result: AI players maintain higher levels of strategic tension for longer durations than elite human players. Human cumulative tension increases abruptly at ~1600 Elo and again at ~2300 Elo, while AI tension varies with algorithmic complexity. Humans limit tension and game complexity, possibly due to cognitive limitations.

Conclusion: AI and humans employ fundamentally different strategic approaches - AI tolerates prolonged interconnected positions with balanced offense/defense, while humans adaptively limit complexity. This difference has implications for AI usage in complex strategic environments where human cognitive constraints may be a factor.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-hop personalized reasoning task to evaluate memory mechanisms in LLM agents for complex reasoning over user information, introduces a dataset and evaluation framework, implements various memory methods, and proposes a hybrid approach called HybridMem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory approaches in LLM agents focus on preference alignment and simple QA but struggle with complex multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring extensive user information processing.

Method: Defined multi-hop personalized reasoning task, constructed dataset and evaluation framework, implemented explicit and implicit memory methods, proposed HybridMem hybrid approach combining both paradigms.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluated various memory methods from multiple perspectives, analyzed their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HybridMem model.

Conclusion: The study addresses limitations in current memory approaches for complex reasoning tasks and provides a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to advance research in personalized reasoning with memory mechanisms.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Conclusion: The AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery by effectively unlocking trapped data in scientific literature.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated

organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials

TL;DR: CardAIc-Agents is a multimodal AI framework that addresses limitations in current AI systems for cardiovascular disease detection by providing adaptive reasoning, external tool integration, continuous learning, and visual outputs for clinical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, exacerbated by healthcare worker shortages. Current AI systems have limitations including rigid workflows, lack of domain-specific tools, static knowledge bases, and limited multimodal capabilities that hinder clinical application.

Method: Proposed CardAIc-Agents framework with: 1) CardiacRAG agent for generating plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, 2) chief agent with tool integration for autonomous execution, 3) stepwise update strategy for dynamic plan refinement, 4) multidisciplinary discussion tool for complex cases, and 5) visual review panels for clinician validation.

Result: Experiments across three datasets demonstrated that CardAIc-Agents outperformed mainstream Vision-Language Models, state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs in efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The CardAIc-Agents framework successfully addresses key limitations of current AI systems for cardiovascular care by providing adaptive reasoning, continuous learning, and multimodal capabilities that support clinical decision-making and validation.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

### [97] [HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333)
*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Jianyong Sun,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt is a novel LLM-based framework that uses Foresight and Hindsight prompting strategies to dynamically adapt evolutionary search and accumulate knowledge from successful heuristics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design methods suffer from static operators and lack knowledge accumulation mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness in evolutionary computation.

Method: Uses two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer search based on population dynamics, and Hindsight-based prompts distill successful heuristics into reusable design principles.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics with faster convergence and superior query efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual Foresight-Hindsight mechanism successfully transforms transient discoveries into persistent knowledge, enabling LLMs to learn from their own experience in evolutionary computation.

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP is a neuro-symbolic planning framework that enables iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components, achieving 85.8% success rate on IPC benchmarks compared to 55.0% for LLM+P.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with errors, while classical planners lack flexibility and natural language understanding. Existing neuro-symbolic methods use one-shot translation, missing the opportunity for collaborative refinement.

Method: LOOP treats planning as iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components, integrating 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks, multi-agent validation, hierarchical decomposition, and causal memory. It generates PDDL specifications and refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback.

Result: LOOP achieved 85.8% success rate on six standard IPC benchmark domains, significantly outperforming LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: The key to reliable planning is making neural networks and symbolic reasoners actually talk to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a blueprint for building trustworthy autonomous systems for critical real-world applications.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER is a modality-agnostic PEFT framework that uses shared prompts to embed diverse modalities into a unified semantic space, improving cross-modal generalization and semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PEFT approaches focus on task-specific gains but neglect embedding space structure, leaving modality-specific representations isolated and limiting cross-modal generalization.

Method: SPANER employs a shared prompt mechanism as a conceptual anchor to make semantically related instances converge spatially regardless of modality. The framework is extensible and supports additional modalities like audio without architectural changes.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks show competitive few-shot retrieval performance while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space.

Conclusion: Aligning embedding structures is more important than merely tuning adapter weights for scalable multimodal learning, and SPANER demonstrates effective cross-modal generalization through shared prompt alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

### [100] [TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404)
*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER is an agentic table extraction system that handles messy, multi-page financial tables through continuous learning and schema-guided extraction, outperforming existing models by 10.1% and improving extraction results by 9.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial documents contain essential financial information buried in messy, multi-page tables with complex structures (99.4% without bounding boxes, up to 426 rows across 44 pages), requiring specialized extraction systems.

Method: TASER uses table agents for detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations leveraging an initial schema, with a Recommender Agent that reviews outputs, recommends schema revisions, and makes final decisions in a continuous learning process.

Result: TASER outperforms Table Transformer by 10.1%, with larger batch sizes increasing actionable schema recommendations by 104.3% and extracted holdings by 9.8%. The system was trained on 22,584 pages (28M tokens) and 3,213 tables representing $731B in holdings.

Conclusion: Agentic, schema-guided extraction systems show promise for robust understanding of real-world financial tables, with continuous learning significantly improving extraction performance and schema recommendations.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery is constrained by human cognitive limits and domain specialization; AI could accelerate discovery by autonomously exploring scientific spaces that humans cannot easily access.

Method: Domain-agnostic agentic AI system that independently navigates the full scientific workflow - hypothesis generation, data collection, analysis pipeline development, and manuscript preparation.

Result: The AI successfully designed and executed three psychological studies (visual working memory, mental rotation, imagery vividness), collected data from 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8+ hour coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigor comparable to human researchers.

Conclusion: This demonstrates AI's capability to conduct non-trivial research autonomously, representing a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, though limitations remain in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. Raises important questions about scientific understanding and credit attribution.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Conclusion: STPFormer provides unified and interpretable representation learning for spatio-temporal traffic forecasting, overcoming limitations of previous Transformer models through its integrated modular architecture.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization problem for minimizing worst-case constraint violations, develops a GPU-accelerated heuristic, and demonstrates significant improvements across three applications: language model quantization, discrete tomography, and FIR filter design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world optimization problems require minimizing worst-case constraint violations across various domains, but existing methods are often domain-specific. The authors aim to create a general, context-free mathematical formulation that can be broadly applied to problems with worst-case performance requirements.

Method: The authors mathematically define the DMMV problem and explore its properties. They develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic that leverages the mathematical properties of DMMV to speed up solution finding for practical problem sizes.

Result: The heuristic achieved: 14% average improvement in language model quantization, 16% error reduction and 6x speedup in discrete tomography under uniform noise, and nearly 50% ripple reduction in FIR filter design compared to commercial solver Gurobi.

Conclusion: DMMV provides a valuable context-free optimization framework, and the proposed GPU-accelerated heuristic offers significant advantages across diverse problem domains. The authors will open-source the implementation to stimulate further research.

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

*Yuzhi Tang,Tianxiao Li,Elizabeth Li,Chris J. Maddison,Honghua Dong,Yangjun Ruan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LM agents show strong theoretical risk knowledge but fail to apply it in practice, with significant performance gaps between risk awareness and safety execution. A risk verifier system with abstractor reduces risky actions by 55.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model agents pose severe risks in safety-critical scenarios despite having theoretical risk knowledge, creating a dangerous gap between awareness and execution.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation framework across three dimensions: risk knowledge, risk identification in trajectories, and actual safety behaviors. Created a risk verifier with abstractor to critique agent actions by converting specific trajectories into abstract descriptions.

Result: Agents show >98% pass rates on risk knowledge but performance drops >23% in risk identification and <26% pass rates in actual safety execution. The risk verifier system reduces risky actions by 55.3% compared to vanilla agents.

Conclusion: Scaling model capabilities alone doesn't resolve safety concerns. The risk verification approach effectively bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical safety execution in LM agents.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Motivation: Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data but is too slow and engineering-heavy for rapid prototyping. Crafter offers a lightweight alternative but lacks the foundation models that have driven progress in Minecraft research.

Method: Introduces CrafterVPT for behavior priors, CrafterCLIP for vision-language grounding, and CrafterSteve-1 for instruction following. Provides toolkits for dataset generation (CrafterPlay, CrafterCaption), reference implementations, benchmarks, and open-source codebase.

Result: Unlocks the Crafter environment as a viable testbed for embodied agent research by providing the missing foundation models and comprehensive tooling that were previously only available for Minecraft.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo makes Crafter a practical, lightweight alternative to Minecraft for rapid prototyping and research in general-purpose embodied agents, bridging the gap between complexity and development speed.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

TL;DR: EAG-RL is a two-stage training framework that enhances LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance and reinforcement learning, achieving 14.62% average improvement in clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data, and existing hybrid approaches fail to improve LLMs' intrinsic reasoning capacity.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Constructs stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to initialize LLM policy, 2) Optimizes policy via reinforcement learning by aligning LLM's attention with clinically salient features from expert EHR models.

Result: 14.62% average improvement in LLMs' EHR reasoning ability, enhanced robustness to feature perturbations, and better generalization to unseen clinical domains on two real-world EHR datasets.

Conclusion: EAG-RL demonstrates practical potential for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks by intrinsically enhancing LLMs' EHR reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: MSRL breaks SFT performance plateau in chart-to-code generation using multimodal structured rewards with textual and visual feedback, achieving 6.2-9.9% improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for vision-language models is underexplored for complex tasks requiring structured outputs like chart-to-code generation, where SFT alone hits performance plateaus despite large datasets.

Method: Multimodal Structured RL (MSRL) with multi-granularity rewards: rule-based textual rewards for code details and model-based visual rewards comparing rendered images, implemented in a two-stage curriculum.

Result: MSRL significantly breaks SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% on ChartMimic and 9.9% on ReachQA benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with closed-source models.

Conclusion: Structured multimodal rewards effectively overcome SFT limitations for complex vision-language tasks, demonstrating RL's potential for structured output generation beyond simple pattern learning.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

*Jikai Chen,Long Chen,Dong Wang,Leilei Gan,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P method improves GUI element localization using suppression attention to reduce background distractions and Gaussian heatmaps inspired by Fitts' Law for precise center-edge distinction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GUI localization methods neglect spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies, while recent attention-based approaches suffer from attention drift and fail to distinguish between center and edges of UI elements, leading to click imprecision.

Method: Proposes Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method with: 1) suppression attention mechanism to minimize focus on irrelevant background regions, and 2) Fitts' Law-inspired 2D Gaussian heatmaps where weight decreases from center to edges based on target size.

Result: Achieves 92.3% and 50.5% performance on ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks respectively. Ablation studies confirm each component's contribution and method's generalizability.

Conclusion: V2P effectively isolates target areas and teaches models to concentrate on the most essential points of UI elements, providing a robust solution for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

*Daniel Daza,Alberto Bernardi,Luca Costabello,Christophe Gueret,Masoud Mansoury,Michael Cochez,Martijn Schut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural Query Reranker (NQR) for answering queries with soft constraints over incomplete knowledge graphs, handling vague preferences interactively without disrupting original answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query answering methods focus on first-order-logic queries but real-world queries often involve vague, context-dependent constraints like attribute preferences or related categories that current approaches cannot handle.

Method: Propose Neural Query Reranker (NQR) that adjusts query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints interactively through incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities, without disrupting original query answers.

Result: Extended existing QA benchmarks with soft constraint datasets and experiments show NQR can effectively capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: NQR successfully addresses the gap in handling soft constraints for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs, providing an interactive solution that works with incremental feedback while preserving original answer quality.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

### [110] [ITL-LIME: Instance-Based Transfer Learning for Enhancing Local Explanations in Low-Resource Data Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13672)
*Rehan Raza,Guanjin Wang,Kevin Wong,Hamid Laga,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ITL-LIME enhances LIME's explanation stability in data-scarce environments by using instance transfer learning with real source domain instances instead of random perturbations, improving fidelity through clustering and contrastive learning-based weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIME's randomness in perturbation and sampling causes locality and instability issues, especially with limited training data, leading to unrealistic variations and poor approximation of complex decision boundaries.

Method: Proposes ITL-LIME framework that uses clustering to partition source domain, retrieves relevant real source instances instead of random perturbations, combines with target neighbors, and employs contrastive learning-based encoder for weighting instances based on proximity.

Result: Enhanced explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained environments by leveraging transfer learning and real instances from related source domains.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME effectively addresses LIME's limitations in data-scarce scenarios by incorporating instance transfer learning and real data instances, providing more stable and faithful explanations.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

*Mariam Arustashvili,Jörg Deigmöller,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard link prediction algorithms underperform on situational knowledge graphs for household actions, failing to beat simple baselines despite being a typical link prediction problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs for household actions are useful for controlling robots and analyzing video footage, but video-extracted information is often incomplete, requiring effective knowledge graph completion to enhance situational awareness.

Method: The paper investigates and evaluates standard link prediction algorithms on situational knowledge graphs describing household actions, comparing their performance against simple baseline methods.

Result: The research shows that many established link prediction algorithms are not suitable for situational knowledge graphs and perform worse than even simple baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Situational knowledge graphs have unique characteristics that make conventional link prediction methods ineffective, highlighting the need for specialized approaches for this domain.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

*Yu Li,Zulong Chen,Wenjian Xu,Hong Wen,Yipeng Yu,Man Lung Yiu,Yuyu Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MHSNet is a multi-level identity verification framework that uses fine-tuned BGE-M3 with contrastive learning and Mixture-of-Experts to detect duplicate resumes from third-party websites, addressing challenges of semantic complexity and information incompleteness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third-party resumes from websites like LinkedIn and Indeed are often incomplete and inaccurate, making it difficult to maintain a quality talent pool. There's a need for effective duplication detection between fetched resumes and existing company resumes despite semantic complexity and structural heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes MHSNet framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. Uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to generate multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling computation of multi-level semantic similarities. State-aware MoE handles diverse incomplete resumes.

Result: Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet in resume duplication detection.

Conclusion: MHSNet provides an effective solution for resume duplication detection, addressing the challenges of semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness in third-party resumes.

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepLog is a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI that provides building blocks and primitives to abstract common representations and computational mechanisms. It includes a language for specifying neurosymbolic models and uses algebraic circuits as computational graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that can represent and emulate various neurosymbolic systems, abstracting away from specific logic types (boolean, fuzzy, probabilistic) and implementation details, making neurosymbolic AI more accessible and efficient.

Method: Developed DeepLog language (annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic) and computational level using extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs. Implemented as software leveraging GPU acceleration for algebraic circuits.

Result: Demonstrated generality through experimental comparisons of different fuzzy/probabilistic logics, architecture vs loss function usage, and showed efficiency gains with GPU-based implementation over CPU-based standalone systems.

Conclusion: DeepLog provides a comprehensive neurosymbolic abstract machine that is both general (supporting various logic types and implementations) and efficient (GPU-accelerated), making it easier to develop and compare different neurosymbolic AI approaches.

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan is a framework that integrates causal reasoning into LLM planning to reduce invalid actions and improve collaboration in multi-agent tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often produce causally invalid actions due to reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning, undermining coordination and planning in dynamic environments.

Method: Two-phase framework with Structural Causal Action (SCA) model that learns causal graphs from agent trajectories to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM proposals and reweighting them.

Result: Consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings on Overcooked-AI benchmark, outperforming reinforcement learning baselines across multiple LLM sizes.

Conclusion: Causality-driven planning enables efficient, interpretable, and generalizable multi-agent LLM systems without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

*Liuxin Bao,Zhihao Peng,Xiaofei Zhou,Runmin Cong,Jiyong Zhang,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EMRC framework uses expertise-aware multi-LLM collaboration to improve medical decision-making accuracy by dynamically selecting optimal LLMs based on medical expertise and integrating their responses with confidence scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs have limitations in medical decision-making due to parametric knowledge constraints and static training, failing to robustly integrate complex clinical information.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) expertise-aware agent recruitment using LLM expertise table for dynamic selection, (2) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration with confidence fusion and adversarial validation.

Result: Achieves 74.45% accuracy on MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, 2.69% improvement over GPT-4-0613, outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods across three public MDM datasets.

Conclusion: EMRC framework effectively leverages specialized LLM capabilities through expertise-aware recruitment and collaborative validation, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance in medical decision-making.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

*Jan Jakubův,Mikoláš Janota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel instantiation method that learns from existing techniques using probabilistic context-free grammars to generate similar terms, balancing exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantified formulas are challenging for SMT solvers due to undecidability, and existing instantiation techniques often complement each other but need better integration.

Method: Dynamically learns from observed instantiations by treating them as samples from a latent language, using probabilistic context-free grammars to generate new similar terms with optional probability inversion for diversity.

Result: The approach can mimic successful past instantiations while also exploring diverse term generation through probability inversion.

Conclusion: This method provides a balanced approach to quantifier reasoning by combining exploitation of proven techniques with exploration of new term possibilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper explores ensemble methods for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, providing theoretical analysis from information entropy perspective and practical framework analysis at pipeline and module levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single RAG frameworks cannot adapt well to diverse downstream tasks, so leveraging multiple RAG systems through ensemble methods becomes necessary to improve performance and robustness.

Method: Comprehensive investigation of RAG ensemble methods with theoretical analysis from information entropy perspective, and mechanistic analysis at pipeline level (Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic) and module level (Generator, Retriever, Reranker) across seven research questions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust at both pipeline and module levels, showing improved performance over single RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for multi-RAG system ensemble research, proving that ensemble approaches enhance adaptability and performance across diverse tasks compared to single RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Improved LLM-based generalized planning framework using pseudocode debugging, reflection, and program variants to generate more reliable Python programs for PDDL domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LLM approaches generated only one strategy directly as Python code, leading to incorrect generalized plans if the strategy was flawed. There was no mechanism to debug strategies before implementation.

Method: 1) Generate strategy as pseudocode with automatic debugging before Python implementation 2) Add reflection step during Python debugging to identify failure reasons 3) Generate multiple program variants and select the best one

Result: Substantial improvement in generalized plan quality across 17 benchmark domains. In 12 domains, the best programs solved all generatable tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions significantly enhance LLM-based generalized planning by catching errors earlier through pseudocode debugging and producing more robust solutions through program variant selection.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a modular agentic framework that automates time-series modeling for financial applications, outperforming traditional AutoML with better accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time-series modeling requires high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models, but current AutoML frameworks lack adaptability to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives.

Method: A structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback using a planner agent with structured knowledge banks and curated libraries.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines on financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks.

Conclusion: TS-Agent provides adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing capabilities that meet the key requirements for high-stakes financial environments.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

TL;DR: AI agents in supply chains exhibit 'collaboration paradox' - designed to cooperate but actually perform worse than non-AI systems due to inventory hoarding behavior


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand emergent strategic behavior of AI-driven agents in economic settings, particularly in multi-echelon supply chains prone to instabilities like bullwhip effect

Method: Computational experiments with generative AI agents (LLM-powered) in controlled supply chain simulation, testing Vendor-Managed Inventory principles and developing a two-layer framework

Result: Discovered catastrophic failure mode where collaborative AI agents perform worse than baselines due to inventory hoarding; developed successful framework combining high-level AI policy-setting with low-level collaborative execution

Conclusion: Provides crucial insight into emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents and offers blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven business systems

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

TL;DR: LLMs can be refined to create virtual assistants that generate PyChrono simulation scripts, providing strong starting points for experts despite occasional imperfections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the entry barrier for simulation tools by enabling LLMs to assist experts in effectively using PyChrono, an open-source multi-physics dynamics engine.

Method: A framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs through a process that improves the quality of generated PyChrono simulation scripts, ranging from simple to complex experiments.

Result: The refined LLMs show quantifiable improvement in script quality, can answer API questions, recommend modeling approaches, and serve as strong starting points that users can modify and improve.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable and can be applied to other simulation tools to harness AI power in generating simulation scripts and lowering entry barriers across various application domains.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

*Christian Blum,Pedro Pinacho-Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BRKGA algorithm outperforms Max-Min Ant System and CPLEX for solving the NP-hard longest run subsequence problem, though large alphabets remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LRS problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem important for bioinformatics and genome reassembly, requiring efficient computational solutions.

Method: Developed a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) with focus on efficient individual evaluation, compared against Max-Min Ant System and CPLEX solver.

Result: BRKGA demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for LRS problem, outperforming both alternative approaches across tested problem instances.

Conclusion: While BRKGA is currently the best technique for LRS, there remains room for improvement particularly for input strings with large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

TL;DR: ComputerRL is a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that combines API calls and GUI interactions, using distributed RL infrastructure and Entropulse training to achieve state-of-the-art performance on desktop automation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an inherent mismatch between machine agents and human-centric desktop environments, and scaling end-to-end RL training for desktop automation remains challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability.

Method: Uses API-GUI paradigm to unify programmatic API calls and direct GUI interaction, develops distributed RL infrastructure for thousands of parallel virtual desktops, and proposes Entropulse training strategy that alternates RL with supervised fine-tuning.

Result: AutoGLM-OS-9B based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1% on OSWorld benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop automation.

Conclusion: ComputerRL framework successfully enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully, with the distributed infrastructure and Entropulse strategy effectively addressing scalability and training stability challenges.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extended pipeline for detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large language models through actor-level metrics analyzing sentiment, syntactic agency, and quotation asymmetries in text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often reflect structural gender imbalances from training data, requiring better methods to detect and mitigate gender discrimination in text corpora.

Method: Extended actor-level pipeline with new metrics for sentiment, syntactic agency, and quotation style asymmetries, applied to German newspaper corpus (1980-2024) with diagnostic analysis and exclusion-based balancing.

Result: Substantial improvements in gender balance across multiple linguistic dimensions, though subtler biases in sentiment and framing persist despite surface-level mitigation.

Conclusion: The tools enable discourse-based fairness auditing and equitable corpus construction, but deeper structural biases require continued attention beyond surface-level rebalancing.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp is a new benchmark with 224 multimodal questions that test AI agents' ability to retrieve and reason with visual content during web browsing, revealing current models' poor performance (29.02% accuracy) on multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web browsing benchmarks focus only on textual information, ignoring the prevalence of multimodal content (images, videos) in real web environments, creating a gap in evaluating true multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created 224 hand-crafted challenging questions that incorporate images in prompts and require extracting information from images/videos during web search. Provided verified checklists for fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models showed poor performance - even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieved only 29.02% accuracy, demonstrating suboptimal multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack native multimodal reasoning abilities for web browsing tasks, highlighting the need for improved multimodal integration and reasoning in future agent development.

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes simultaneous translation approach for real-time on-device streaming speech translation, integrating ASR and MT with efficient beam-search pruning to balance quality and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in integrating Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation for real-time on-device streaming speech translation, as achieving streaming translation in real-time remains difficult despite advances in ASR systems.

Method: Simultaneous translation approach that leverages linguistic cues from ASR to manage context, uses efficient beam-search pruning techniques (time-out and forced finalization) to maintain real-time performance, and integrates ASR and MT systems effectively.

Result: Techniques outperform baselines in both latency and quality, narrowing the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems in on-device bilingual conversational speech translation.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation by effectively balancing translation quality and latency through optimized ASR-MT integration and pruning techniques.

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [128] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning capabilities in LLMs have limited and varied effects on idiomaticity detection, with larger models showing better understanding of idiomatic expressions than smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how reasoning capabilities affect idiomaticity detection performance in LLMs and examine the effect of model size, since idiomatic expressions require understanding before disambiguation.

Method: Evaluated DeepSeek-R1 distillation models (1.5B to 70B parameters) across four idiomaticity detection datasets, testing chain-of-thought reasoning and providing definitions in prompts for smaller models.

Result: Reasoning effect was smaller than expected - CoT improved performance from math-tuned intermediate models but not to base model levels; larger models (14B+) showed modest improvements and better understanding of idiomaticity; providing definitions helped smaller models in some cases.

Conclusion: Larger models demonstrate superior understanding of idiomatic expressions and can benefit from reasoning capabilities, while smaller models struggle with actual meaning comprehension and may benefit from external definition support.

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhancing ASR performance by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA into Whisper using token-level distillation with optimal transport and representation loss minimization, achieving significant improvements in WER, NER, capitalization, and punctuation for long audio transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy in long audio transcripts, which negatively impacts downstream tasks like Named Entity Recognition, capitalization, and punctuation.

Method: Two strategies: (1) token-level distillation with optimal transport to align dimensions and sequence lengths between Whisper and LLaMA, (2) representation loss minimization between sentence embeddings to blend syntax and semantics.

Result: Significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), NER performance, capitalization, and punctuation success on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset benchmark with long audios and rich entities.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the value of integrating linguistic context into transcription and sets a foundation for robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech through semantics-aware approaches.

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [130] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B is a 14B-parameter language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct for data analysis and graduate-level problem solving, featuring dual reasoning modes and trained on full analytical trajectories with a novel reinforcement learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a virtual data analyst that avoids common issues like format collapse and verbosity in RL-aligned LLMs, while providing both agentic code execution and compact reasoning capabilities for complex quantitative problems.

Method: Combines trajectory-centric synthetic data generation (144K notebook episodes), dual-reward framework with structural and semantic scoring, memory-optimized GRPO implementation, and cosine curriculum that shifts from structural to semantic focus. Features dual reasoning interfaces: ReAct-tagged agentic mode and compact CoT reflection mode.

Result: Achieves up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench compared to similar-size models, reaches performance levels of larger models like QwQ-32B, while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution. Shows effective "AHA-moment" pattern with hypothesis revision and convergence.

Conclusion: Datarus demonstrates that training on full analytical trajectories with dual-reward reinforcement learning and dual reasoning interfaces can create highly efficient and accurate problem-solving models that outperform comparable systems while being more token-efficient.

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on cultural word associations improves LLM cultural alignment, boosting association accuracy and shifting value responses toward target cultures without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs reflect distributional biases from their training data, lacking cultural alignment. Current approaches struggle with limited cultural knowledge and effective learning methods for cultural adaptation.

Method: Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B using native speakers' free word-association norms from Small-World-of-Words project via supervised fine-tuning and PPO-based preference optimization.

Result: 16-20% English and 43-165% Mandarin association improvement, +0.20 median concreteness gain, human-level valence/arousal. Models shift World-Values-Survey responses toward target culture, with 7-8B models matching/beating vanilla 70B baselines.

Conclusion: Cultural alignment can be achieved efficiently using cognitive-grounded associations, highlighting the promise of human cognition-based approaches for improving AI cultural alignment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed is a reinforcement learning framework that transforms medical LLMs from reactive answer generators to proactive question-askers using Shapley Information Gain rewards, achieving 54.45% improvement over reactive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs operate reactively by generating answers without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in interactive clinical settings where physicians need to actively gather information from patients.

Method: A two-stage RL framework: 1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization using Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct high-reward trajectories, and 2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions.

Result: ProMed outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases on two newly curated medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transitions medical LLMs to a proactive paradigm, enabling them to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making, which is crucial for accurate diagnoses in interactive medical settings.

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [133] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-tuning of Saudi Arabic foundation model improves dialect generation for Najdi and Hijazi dialects, achieving 84% Saudi dialect rate and reducing MSA leakage from 33% to 6% with improved text fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic LLMs are dominated by Modern Standard Arabic with limited support for Saudi dialects like Najdi and Hijazi, hindering authentic dialectal variation capture.

Method: Used privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction dataset (5,466 synthetic pairs) to LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview. Tested two variants: Dialect-Token (with explicit dialect tag) and No-Token training.

Result: Dialect-Token model achieved best control: Saudi dialect rate increased from 47.97% to 84.21%, MSA leakage reduced from 32.63% to 6.21%. Fidelity improved (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both variants outperformed generic instruction models.

Conclusion: LoRA-tuning with explicit dialect tags effectively improves Saudi dialect generation control and fidelity while avoiding metadata-tag echoing issues seen in baseline models. Training code and datasheet released for verification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

TL;DR: MATA is a new evaluation dataset for assessing LLM capabilities in Telugu language, featuring 729 multiple-choice and open-ended questions across diverse linguistic dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models in Telugu, a low-resource language, and understand their limitations through fine-grained analysis.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset of 729 questions, evaluated 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs, analyzed performance patterns including reliance on superficial heuristics, and compared LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation.

Result: Found that LLMs rely on superficial heuristics like answer position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions, and identified reliability issues with LLM-as-a-judge evaluation in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Fine-grained evaluation is essential for understanding model limitations and can guide development of more linguistically capable LLMs, while serving as a foundation for future Telugu NLP research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

TL;DR: Compressed deep learning models may maintain accuracy but lack trust-equivalence with original models, showing poor interpretability alignment and calibration similarity despite performance parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if compressed deep learning models can be trusted as much as original large models, going beyond accuracy metrics to assess true trust-equivalence.

Method: Proposed two-dimensional framework: 1) interpretability alignment using LIME and SHAP tests to check if models use same input features, 2) calibration similarity assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score and reliability diagrams. Experiments used BERT-base and compressed variants on text classification tasks.

Result: Low interpretability alignment and significant calibration mismatch even when accuracies were nearly identical between compressed and original models.

Conclusion: Compressed models are not trust-equivalent to large models. Deployment requires careful assessment beyond performance parity metrics.

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decoding strategies significantly impact LLM performance in medical tasks, with deterministic methods like beam search outperforming stochastic approaches. Medical LLMs show no overall advantage over general models but are more sensitive to decoding choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different decoding strategies affect text generation quality in healthcare applications where accuracy is critical, as this area remains underexplored despite its importance.

Method: Evaluated 11 decoding strategies across five medical tasks (translation, summarization, QA, dialogue, image captioning) using medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of various sizes, with multiple evaluation metrics including BERTScore, ROUGE, and MAUVE.

Result: Deterministic strategies (especially beam search) outperform stochastic ones; larger models achieve higher scores but have longer inference times; medical LLMs show no overall performance advantage but greater sensitivity to decoding choices; MAUVE shows weak agreement with other metrics.

Conclusion: Careful selection of decoding methods is crucial in medical applications as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice, highlighting the need for task-specific decoding strategy optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs like Bark show emergent gender awareness but no systematic gender bias in speaker assignment for gendered prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Speech-LLMs exhibit gender bias similar to text-based LLMs, using speaker assignment as an explicit bias indicator since these models must produce gendered voices.

Method: Evaluated Bark TTS model's default speaker assignments for textual prompts using two datasets: (1) gender-stereotyped professions and (2) words with gendered connotations.

Result: Bark does not show systematic gender bias but demonstrates gender awareness and some gender inclinations in speaker selection.

Conclusion: Speech-LLMs exhibit gender awareness without systematic bias patterns, suggesting differences from text-based models in how gender associations are handled.

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP is a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using sparse autoencoders that outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are deployed in real-world applications, there's a need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while preserving model utility. Current SAE-based methods operate at inference time and don't create persistent parameter changes, making them vulnerable to bypassing by malicious actors.

Method: CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple layers and suppresses their activations to achieve persistent concept unlearning in a parameter-efficient manner.

Result: Experiments on two LLMs show CRISP outperforms prior approaches on WMDP benchmark safety-critical unlearning tasks, successfully removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis shows semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts.

Conclusion: CRISP provides an effective parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning that achieves precise suppression of target features while maintaining model utility and preventing malicious bypassing.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs perform poorly on Vietnamese educational exams, achieving only 57.74% accuracy (SOTA models) and 27.70% (open-source), significantly underperforming humans (66.54% average, 99.60% best). Cross-lingual prompting hurts performance, while human collaboration provides modest improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how vision language models trained predominantly on English data perform on real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning tasks, specifically Vietnamese educational assessments which remain largely unexplored.

Method: Created ViExam benchmark with 2,548 multimodal questions across 7 academic domains. Tested state-of-the-art and open-source VLMs, compared against human performance, and experimented with cross-lingual prompting and human-in-the-loop collaboration.

Result: VLMs significantly underperform humans: SOTA models achieve 57.74% accuracy, open-source models 27.70%, while humans average 66.54% and best achieve 99.60%. Cross-lingual prompting decreased accuracy by 1%, while human collaboration improved performance by 5 percentage points.

Conclusion: Current VLMs struggle with genuine cross-lingual multimodal reasoning in educational contexts, highlighting the need for better multilingual and multimodal training approaches beyond English-centric data.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

### [141] [Generics and Default Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13718)
*James Ravi Kirkpatrick,Rachel Katharine Sterken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of 28 LLMs on 20 defeasible reasoning patterns with generics, showing varied performance, CoT prompting degradation, and models struggling with defeasible vs deductive inference distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM capabilities in non-monotonic logic reasoning with generic generalizations, which are crucial for default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition across multiple disciplines.

Method: Tested 28 large language models on 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies.

Result: Performance varied widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot modestly improved some models, but CoT prompting caused significant performance degradation (-11.14% mean accuracy drop). Most models failed to distinguish defeasible from deductive inference or misinterpreted generics as universal statements.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promise and limitations for default reasoning, highlighting the need for improved handling of defeasible inference patterns and better understanding of generic statements.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

*Hanna Herasimchyk,Alhassan Abdelhalim,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prediction accuracy alone doesn't prove word embeddings contain semantic knowledge, as methods can predict random information due to algorithmic upper bounds rather than meaningful semantic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that accurate prediction of semantic features from word embeddings implies the embeddings contain corresponding knowledge, and to improve interpretability of AI systems.

Method: Examined common explanation methods that map word embeddings to human-interpretable semantic features (feature norms), and demonstrated these methods can successfully predict even random information.

Result: Prediction accuracy is predominantly determined by algorithmic upper bounds rather than meaningful semantic representation, and geometric similarity in vector spaces doesn't indicate genuine semantic property emergence.

Conclusion: Comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance are unreliable for determining which dataset is better captured by word embeddings, as current methods primarily reflect geometric similarity rather than genuine semantic knowledge.

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

TL;DR: EEG-MedRAG is a hypergraph-based framework that integrates EEG data, patient cases, and medical knowledge for improved clinical decision support through semantic-temporal retrieval and diagnostic generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently retrieve and interpret large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data for neuroscience and clinical applications, addressing challenges in semantic understanding of EEG data across different diseases and clinical perspectives.

Method: A three-layer hypergraph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge, individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and causal-chain diagnostic generation.

Result: EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval performance, demonstrating strong potential for real-world clinical decision support.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of EEG data interpretation and retrieval, showing superior performance over existing methods and providing a valuable tool for clinical applications with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

### [144] [Sycophancy under Pressure: Evaluating and Mitigating Sycophantic Bias via Adversarial Dialogues in Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13743)
*Kaiwei Zhang,Qi Jia,Zijian Chen,Wei Sun,Xiangyang Zhu,Chunyi Li,Dandan Zhu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit sycophancy - aligning with user beliefs over facts, especially problematic in scientific QA. The paper introduces an evaluation framework and Pressure-Tune method to measure and mitigate this behavior while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy in LLMs poses serious risks in high-stakes scientific settings where factual accuracy is crucial, but this phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts despite preference-based alignment techniques reinforcing this problematic behavior.

Method: Introduces a unified evaluation framework with adversarial prompting and metrics (misleading/sycophancy resistance), plus Pressure-Tune - a lightweight post-training method using synthetic adversarial dialogues with chain-of-thought rationales that reject misinformation while reinforcing facts.

Result: Systematic evaluations reveal pervasive sycophantic tendencies across models, driven more by alignment strategy than model size. Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback.

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune offers a practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior in scientific QA by effectively mitigating sycophantic tendencies while maintaining model performance and responsiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

*Shengchao Liu,Xiaoming Liu,Chengzhengxu Li,Zhaohan Zhang,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Shuai Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGT-Prism is a machine-generated text detection method that uses frequency domain analysis to improve domain generalization by filtering domain-sensitive features and aligning spectral patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-generated text detectors perform well within the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains due to domain shift between different data sources.

Method: Analyzes text representations in frequency domain, uses low frequency filtering to remove domain-sensitive features, and implements dynamic spectrum alignment to extract domain-invariant features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Frequency domain analysis provides consistent spectral patterns for detecting machine-generated text across diverse domains, enabling better domain generalization than existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

*Hanna Woloszyn,Benjamin Gagl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to accurately replicate child language patterns, producing longer but less lexically rich texts with different semantic structures compared to real German children's descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-generated text resembles child language, as LLMs are increasingly used in education but their ability to produce age-appropriate language is unknown.

Method: Generated two LLM corpora using German picture stories with zero-shot and few-shot prompts, then compared psycholinguistic properties (word frequency, lexical richness, sentence length, POS tags, semantic similarity) against real children's descriptions.

Result: LLM texts were longer but less lexically rich, used more high-frequency words, under-represented nouns, and showed low semantic similarity. Few-shot prompts only slightly improved similarities but still failed to replicate key patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs cannot adequately replicate child language, raising concerns about their appropriateness in child-directed educational tools while providing insights for psycholinguistic research.

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

TL;DR: TracSum is a new benchmark for traceable, aspect-based medical summarization with sentence-level citations, featuring 3.5K annotated summary-citation pairs and a comprehensive evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about factual accuracy in LLM-generated medical summaries by enabling users to trace evidence back to original sources through sentence-level citations.

Method: Created TracSum benchmark with 500 annotated medical abstracts across 7 aspects, developed evaluation metrics for completeness/consistency, and proposed Track-Then-Sum pipeline as baseline method.

Result: TracSum effectively benchmarks traceable summarization tasks. Explicit sentence-level tracking before summarization improves accuracy, and full context incorporation enhances completeness.

Conclusion: TracSum serves as a valuable benchmark for traceable aspect-based summarization, demonstrating that evidence tracing improves factual accuracy in medical document summarization.

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

*Maciej Skorski,Alina Landowska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI language models rank among top 25% of human annotators in moral understanding, with better balanced accuracy and fewer false negatives than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans, addressing limitations of prior work that used deterministic ground truth approaches.

Method: Large-scale Bayesian evaluation using GPU-optimized framework, modeling annotator disagreements to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Evaluated top models (Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on 100K+ texts from social media, news, and forums.

Result: AI models typically rank among top 25% of human annotators with much better-than-average balanced accuracy. AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, indicating more sensitive moral detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Large language models demonstrate superior moral detection sensitivity compared to humans, performing at elite human annotator levels with significantly reduced false negative rates.

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A prompt-based strategy that enables LLMs to generate exactly the desired number of tokens by appending countdown markers and explicit counting rules, achieving over 95% length compliance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precise length control, frequently overshooting or undershooting explicit length instructions because they cannot reliably maintain internal token counts.

Method: One-shot prompt strategy that appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules, forcing the model to 'write while counting' without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling.

Result: On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 improved from below 30% to above 95%, surpassing draft-then-revise baseline while preserving answer quality.

Conclusion: Precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

*Maria Paz Oliva,Adriana Correia,Ivan Vankov,Viktor Botev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis reveals persistent challenges in automatic NLG evaluation metrics, showing no single metric works universally across tasks and advocating for task-specific metric selection and better validation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural Language Generation evaluation is crucial but challenging, with human evaluation being expensive and automatic metrics lacking standardization and consistent performance across different tasks.

Method: Conducted thorough examination of existing automatic evaluation metrics methodologies, their strengths/limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment, including analysis of LLM-based evaluators and RAG evaluation.

Result: Identified key challenges: metrics capture only specific text quality aspects, effectiveness varies by task/dataset, validation practices are unstructured, and human judgment correlations are inconsistent - even with latest LLM-as-a-Judge approaches.

Conclusion: Challenges the quest for a 'perfect metric', proposes selecting metrics based on task-specific needs with complementary evaluations, and advocates for new metrics to focus on enhanced validation methodologies.

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates automated requirement extraction from French construction documents using NLP techniques, with plans to represent outcomes as a knowledge graph for enhanced automatic verification systems.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI is a comprehensive multilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, addressing gaps in multilingual evaluation, modality coverage, and fine-grained knowledge annotation across 4 subjects and 5 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific benchmarks for multimodal large language models lack comprehensive evaluation in multilingual scenarios, adequate modality coverage assessment, and fine-grained scientific knowledge annotation.

Method: Collected 1,019 high-quality question-answer pairs covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology across 5 languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Japanese) with 3 distinct evaluation modes. Evaluated 16 open-source and 4 closed-source models.

Result: MME-SCI proved highly challenging - o4-mini achieved only 52.11% (math), 24.73% (physics), 36.57% (chemistry), and 29.80% (biology) accuracy in Image-only mode, showing significantly higher difficulty than existing benchmarks. Enabled deep analysis of model weaknesses in specific domains.

Conclusion: MME-SCI serves as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark that effectively identifies limitations in current MLLMs' scientific reasoning capabilities, particularly in multilingual and multimodal contexts, providing valuable insights for future model improvements.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongMab-PO uses Multi-Armed Bandit strategy to select informative context chunks for generating high-quality diverse responses, then applies DPO training to optimize LLMs for long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches with synthetic data suffer from low diversity and factual inconsistencies, limiting long-context modeling effectiveness.

Method: Treats context chunks as MAB arms, selects chunks based on reward scores to generate responses, iteratively updates scores, and applies DPO training on collected responses.

Result: Significantly improves diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data quality issues in long-context modeling and demonstrates superior performance through intelligent context selection and DPO optimization.

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SvS strategy for RLVR training uses self-play with variational problem synthesis to maintain policy entropy and improve Pass@k performance in LLM reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla RLVR training improves Pass@1 but reduces generation diversity and limits Pass@k performance, which represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability.

Method: Online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy that uses policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while keeping reference answers identical to originals.

Result: Achieves absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, with consistent improvements across 12 reasoning benchmarks and model sizes from 3B to 32B.

Conclusion: SvS effectively maintains policy entropy during training, sustains prolonged improvements, and demonstrates generalizability and robustness across various reasoning tasks and model scales.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs for agentic tasks can unintentionally make them more likely to execute harmful requests. PING method uses natural language prefixes to guide agents to refuse harmful tasks while maintaining performance on benign ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns are often overlooked when fine-tuning LLMs for agentic capabilities, leading to unintentional misalignment where models become more likely to execute harmful tasks and less likely to refuse them.

Method: Prefix INjection Guard (PING) - an iterative approach that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses. The method alternates between generating candidate prefixes and selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior.

Result: PING significantly enhances safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing effectiveness. It consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in web navigation and code generation tasks. Analysis shows prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification.

Conclusion: PING provides an effective solution to safety challenges in agentic LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating that carefully crafted natural language prefixes can guide models to refuse harmful requests while maintaining performance on benign tasks.

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

TL;DR: LLMs with expert knowledge integration through in-context learning outperform traditional methods for sentiment analysis in online health communities, achieving expert-level performance without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital health analytics face challenges with complex patient-generated content requiring scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in healthcare settings.

Method: Developed a structured codebook encoding expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting. Compared six GPT models with DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 against BioBERT variants and lexicon-based methods using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.

Result: LLMs achieved superior performance with expert-level agreement, showing no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement levels, suggesting knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition.

Conclusion: LLMs with in-context learning offer a scalable solution for digital health analytics, addressing expert knowledge shortage and enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for patient monitoring and evidence-based health strategies.

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate in-context learning of physics concepts through dynamics forecasting tasks, with performance improving with longer contexts. Sparse autoencoders reveal encoded physical variables like energy in model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms that enable LLMs to perform successful in-context learning across diverse tasks, using physics as a tractable testbed grounded in real-world principles.

Method: Used dynamics forecasting tasks in physical systems to evaluate ICL capabilities, analyzed residual stream activations with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify encoded physical concepts.

Result: Performance improves with longer input contexts, and SAEs capture features correlating with key physical variables like energy, showing meaningful physical concepts are encoded during ICL.

Conclusion: This work provides novel insights into how LLMs learn physical concepts in context, broadening understanding of ICL mechanisms in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Conclusion: The approach provides deeper sentiment insights during crises and presents a promising AI-driven solution for real-time disaster management, bridging multimodal analysis with emergency response optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

### [162] [Strategies for training point distributions in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13216)
*Santosh Humagain,Toni Schneidereit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic investigation of training point distribution strategies for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) shows that point selection significantly impacts solution accuracy and is connected to differential equation characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks show promise for solving differential equations but their performance depends on various factors, particularly the training point distribution which hasn't been systematically studied.

Method: Tested two ODEs and two PDEs with five training point generation strategies using shallow networks (1-2 hidden layers), including novel sine-based points inspired by Chebyshev nodes, with controlled weight initialization for reproducibility.

Result: Training point distributions significantly impact solution accuracy, with evidence showing connection to differential equation characteristics. Sine-based points performed well.

Conclusion: Careful selection of training point distribution is crucial for PINN performance and should be tailored to the specific differential equation characteristics.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

*Su Chen,Xiaohua Qi,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Xiaolin Xu,Yangxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGNPP model combines graph neural networks with point processes to capture both network topology and temporal dynamics for temporal interaction networks, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches treated temporal interaction networks as coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problems, ignoring the important influence of network topology structure.

Method: DGNPP consists of Node Aggregation Layer (captures topological structures for static representations) and Self Attentive Layer (dynamically updates embeddings over time), incorporating both embeddings into event intensity function and optimizing via maximum likelihood estimation.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three public datasets show DGNPP achieves superior performance in both event prediction and time prediction tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: DGNPP effectively addresses the limitations of prior approaches by incorporating network topology structure and demonstrates strong performance in temporal interaction network analysis.

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent neural network clustering method for S-P educational charts using network dynamics with multiple fixed points to handle large student datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As the number of students increases, S-P charts (binary educational data) become difficult to manage, requiring a method to classify large charts into smaller, more manageable ones.

Method: A clustering method based on recurrent neural network dynamics where the network has multiple fixed points and basins of attraction that correspond to clusters representing smaller S-P charts.

Result: Fundamental experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the method, with evaluation using average caution index to characterize singularity of student answer patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed recurrent neural network clustering method is effective for handling large S-P educational charts by classifying them into smaller clusters through network dynamics.

Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering
method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the
number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to
classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering
method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple
fixed points and basins of attraction give clusters corresponding to small S-P
charts. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, we present an
important feature quantity: average caution index that characterizes
singularity of students answer oatterns. Performing fundamental experiments,
effectiveness of the method is confirmed.

*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage framework that enhances Vision-Language Models' reasoning for complex image annotation tasks by generating verified reasoning chains through reinforcement learning and then fine-tuning with high-quality reasoning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with complex image annotation tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. Standard SFT ignores rationales, and Visual-RFT produces inconsistent reasoning chains due to lack of verified CoTs during pre-training.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) RISE-CoT uses reinforcement learning in an "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop to generate verified CoTs; 2) RISE-R1 filters high-quality CoTs for supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT on both complex and simple image annotation tasks, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: RISE provides a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning capabilities without requiring manually annotated reasoning chains, enabling better performance on complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

*Lakshmi Priya P. K.,Andreas Schwung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel methodology combining sparse regression and Lie derivatives to discover governing equations and design feedback controllers for physical systems, ensuring no internal dynamics through relative degree conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering governing equations and designing effective feedback controllers for physical systems is challenging, requiring deep understanding of nonlinear dynamics. Existing approaches need improvement in combining system identification with feedback linearization.

Method: Uses sparse regression algorithm for system identification, then applies Lie derivatives to output function dictionary to design feedback controller. Combines stacked regression algorithm with relative degree conditions to discover and feedback linearize true governing equations.

Result: Proposes a methodology that can identify feedback linearized physical systems based on prior dynamic behavior, with guaranteed absence of internal dynamics through augmented constraints.

Conclusion: The novel combination of sparse regression and relative degree conditions provides an effective approach for discovering true governing equations and designing feedback controllers for physical systems with complex nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

### [167] [Physically Plausible Data Augmentations for Wearable IMU-based Human Activity Recognition Using Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13284)
*Nobuyuki Oishi,Philip Birch,Daniel Roggen,Paula Lago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) using physics simulation to generate realistic sensor data for Human Activity Recognition, outperforming traditional signal transformation methods with 3.7 pp average F1 score improvement and requiring 60% fewer training subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signal transformation-based data augmentation methods in HAR often create physically implausible data that doesn't preserve activity meaning, limiting model generalization due to scarcity of high-quality labeled sensor data.

Method: PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video pose estimation, then uses physics simulation to incorporate realistic variabilities including body movement modifications, sensor placement changes, and hardware effects.

Result: PPDA consistently outperformed traditional methods, improving macro F1 scores by average 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects across three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts.

Conclusion: Physics simulation enables physically plausible data augmentation that effectively addresses annotation scarcity in HAR, providing a cost-effective and scalable approach for generating synthetic IMU data to train deep learning models.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Nina Corvelo Benz,Suhas Thejaswi,Nuria Oliver,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A collaborative matching system called comatch that defers decisions to humans when uncertain, achieving better performance than humans or algorithms alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithmic matching systems don't achieve human-AI complementarity - decisions made by humans using AI aren't necessarily better than either alone.

Method: Proposed collaborative matching (comatch) system that selects only decisions it's most confident in, deferring the rest to human decision makers while optimizing the allocation to maximize performance.

Result: Large-scale human study with 800 participants showed comatch outperforms both human participants and algorithmic matching alone.

Conclusion: Collaborative matching approach successfully achieves human-AI complementarity and improves matching outcomes in high-stakes domains like healthcare and social services.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at

*Floris den Hengst,Inès Blin,Majid Mohammadi,Syed Ihtesham Hussain Shah,Taraneh Younesian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) extends conformal prediction to incorporate class hierarchies, producing structured prediction sets while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring semantic relationships and hierarchical structure among class labels, which limits its practical utility.

Method: Formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem that yields prediction sets composed of nodes at different hierarchy levels. Show that a smaller subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while maintaining optimality.

Result: Empirical evaluation on audio, image, and text benchmarks shows advantages of hierarchical approach. User study demonstrates annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.

Conclusion: HCC successfully incorporates class hierarchies into conformal prediction, providing structured and semantically meaningful prediction sets while preserving coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

### [170] [Efficient Constraint-Aware Flow Matching via Randomized Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13316)
*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained Flow Matching for generating samples that satisfy given constraints, with two approaches: differentiable distance penalty and oracle-based randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Flow Matching methods lack mechanisms to ensure generated samples satisfy specific constraints, limiting their practical applications in scenarios where constraints are essential.

Method: Two approaches: (1) For differentiable constraints, add distance penalty to FM objective; (2) For oracle-based constraints, use randomization to learn mean flow with high constraint satisfaction likelihood. Also proposes efficient two-stage approach.

Result: Numerical experiments show significant gains in constraint satisfaction while maintaining target distribution matching. Successfully applied to adversarial example generation using black-box classifier queries.

Conclusion: Proposed methods effectively handle constrained generation in both differentiable and oracle-based settings, outperforming existing approaches and enabling practical applications like adversarial training.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

### [171] [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
*Dylan Cope,Peter McBurney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploring language acquisition under partial observability where learners must infer hidden information from environment, actions, and messages rather than having full access to all relevant context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional language acquisition models assume full observability, but real-world learning often involves partial information where learners must infer hidden context from limited cues.

Method: The paper presents a learning-based algorithm that decodes private information by analyzing environmental knowledge, actions taken, and messages sent to facilitate language acquisition in partially observable settings.

Result: The approach demonstrates successful language decoding in toy settings and formally identifies challenges that emerge in more general partially observable language learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Partial observability presents a more realistic and challenging language acquisition problem that requires inference capabilities, and the proposed learning algorithm shows promise for decoding hidden information to support language learning.

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel fMRI classification framework using dynamic graph creation and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis, achieving superior performance over static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI classification methods rely on static functional connectivity or fail to comprehensively capture spatio-temporal relationships, limiting their effectiveness in understanding complex neural dynamics.

Method: Dynamically infers functional brain connectivity using transformer-based attention mechanisms, constructs time-varying graphs processed with GCNs and transformers to capture both localized interactions and global temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC on ABIDE dataset subset, significantly outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN: 51.8%).

Conclusion: Validates the efficacy of joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI classification, with core novelty in attention-driven dynamic graph creation and hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Conclusion: X-MoE successfully addresses the scalability limitations of current MoE training systems and enables efficient training of next-generation MoE architectures on diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel

Motivation: To establish fundamental limits on the performance of linear methods for function approximation problems, particularly for kernel methods where sample size requirements are crucial.

Method: Uses a linear algebraic argument previously applied to Kolmogorov n-width lower bounds, extending this approach to derive sample size lower bounds specifically for kernel methods.

Result: Provides theoretical lower bounds on the dimension and sample size requirements for kernel methods in L^2 function approximation problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual prediction rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models that fail under data scarcity, creating a need for approaches that can incorporate expert knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor.

Method: A time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals as structured priors for generative modeling, bridging mechanistic and data-driven approaches.

Result: ODE-Diff consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables more reliable and interpretable causal inference by effectively combining expert knowledge with data-driven modeling, addressing limitations of existing approaches in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework for calibrating trajectory ensembles to produce prediction intervals with coverage guarantees


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory ensembles from probabilistic models or multiple predictors are commonly uncalibrated despite reflecting inherent uncertainty, which limits their reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and forecasting

Method: Proposes a unified conformal prediction framework with novel online update step and optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies to transform sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals

Result: The method produces discontinuous prediction intervals around trajectories, naturally captures temporal dependencies, and yields sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates with theoretical coverage guarantees

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to calibrate trajectory ensembles, offering reliable uncertainty quantification for trajectory prediction tasks across various domains

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

*Seohyeon Cha,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: J3O framework for joint optimization of model onloading and query offloading in multi-task edge inference systems, achieving near-optimal accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world edge applications require concurrent execution of multiple tasks (detection, segmentation, depth estimation) but existing frameworks only handle single-task scenarios, creating a need for unified multi-task optimization.

Method: Formulated as mixed-integer program, J3O uses alternating algorithm with greedy model selection via Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization and optimal offloading via constrained linear programming, extended for edge batching.

Result: Achieves over 97% of optimal accuracy while requiring less than 15% of the runtime compared to optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: J3O provides an efficient and scalable solution for multi-task collaborative inference in edge computing environments, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantitative method for evaluating spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones and statistically anomalous channels identified through chirp event analysis, providing a complementary approach for SOZ localization.

Method: Two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection using Local Outlier Factor analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection based on spectro-temporal features; (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis computing exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity.

Result: LOF-based approach effectively detected outliers, with weighted index matching outperforming exact matching. Highest performance metrics were achieved for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), while failure cases showed lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460).

Conclusion: Chirp-based outlier detection combined with weighted spatial metrics provides an effective complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly valuable for patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

TL;DR: Systematic investigation of molecular large language models (Mol-LLMs) reveals weak correlation between pretraining metrics and downstream performance, with NovoMolGen achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient exploration of vast chemical space (10^23 to 10^60 possible molecules) requires understanding how standard language modeling practices impact molecular generation performance, as current Mol-LLMs lack systematic evaluation of key factors like representations, tokenization, model size, and dataset scale.

Method: Introduces NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5 billion molecules, with systematic investigation of textual representations, tokenization strategies, model size, and dataset scale through extensive empirical analyses.

Result: Identifies weak correlation between pretraining performance metrics and actual downstream performance, revealing important distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen substantially outperforms prior Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and goal-directed molecular generation tasks.

Conclusion: NovoMolGen provides a robust foundation for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies, establishing new state-of-the-art results and demonstrating the importance of systematic evaluation of language modeling practices for molecular generation.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

*Chuyun Deng,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Network-aware contextual bandit algorithms that enable adaptive information sharing across networked agents, reducing learning complexity from O(N) to sublinear O(√N) while maintaining lighter communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in contextual bandits for networked environments where information is partially shared, moving beyond fully centralized or completely isolated learning approaches.

Method: Developed two network-aware UCB algorithms (NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB) that decompose learning into global and local components using dynamically updated network weights for adaptive information sharing. Agents only share computed summaries of homogeneous features.

Result: Achieved sublinear regret bounds O(√N) instead of O(N), with complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB handles high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. Demonstrated effectiveness in simulated pricing environments.

Conclusion: The proposed networked contextual bandit framework successfully enables efficient information sharing across distributed agents, significantly reducing learning complexity while maintaining practical communication efficiency, with different algorithms suited for different environmental conditions.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAVIS enables dynamic multi-objective alignment of LLMs at inference time using small value models, eliminating the need for expensive per-objective fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning for each objective configuration is computationally expensive and inflexible for handling diverse user preferences in multi-objective LLM applications.

Method: Trains small value models for each objective, combines them at inference with user-specified weights to create a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods that fine-tune per-objective models and approaches performance of models fine-tuned for exact user preferences.

Conclusion: MAVIS provides a lightweight, flexible framework for dynamic multi-objective alignment without modifying base model weights, offering computational efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

### [182] [EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434)
*Yunfeng Ge,Ming Jin,Yiji Zhao,Hongyan Li,Bo Du,Chang Xu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EventTSF is an autoregressive diffusion framework that integrates textual events with time series data to improve non-stationary forecasting, addressing synchronization, uncertainty, and alignment challenges through adaptive flow matching and multimodal transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting approaches rely on single modalities, limiting contextual knowledge and performance. Incorporating natural language-based external events remains unexplored despite their importance in domains like energy and transportation where non-stationary dynamics interact with multimodal events.

Method: EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step, adaptively controlling timesteps based on event semantic signals. It employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer to fuse temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines, achieving 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and 1.13x faster training efficiency across diverse event-aware non-stationary forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed EventTSF framework successfully addresses the challenges of multimodal time series forecasting by effectively integrating textual events with temporal data through adaptive diffusion and transformer-based fusion, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer combines SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on directed graph node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing directed graph neural networks struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to isotropic aggregation and localized filtering mechanisms.

Method: SVDformer refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention to enhance critical spectral components and suppress noise, using singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: SVDformer establishes a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs by synergizing SVD and Transformer architecture for explicit preservation of edge directionality during feature propagation.

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Conclusion: The metalearning method effectively accelerates AutoML optimization by intelligently reducing search spaces using historical knowledge, providing insights into meta-feature selection, model explainability, and trade-offs in search space reduction strategies.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning

traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead

designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCAL classifier for hierarchical multi-label classification uses prototype contrastive learning and adaptive task-weighting to maintain structural consistency and balance optimization in multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in hierarchical multi-label classification within multi-task learning frameworks.

Method: Integrates prototype contrastive learning with adaptive task-weighting mechanisms, includes semantic consistency modeling through label and feature aggregation from child to parent classes, and uses prototype perturbation with controlled noise injection.

Result: Achieves higher classification accuracy and reduced hierarchical violation rate across three datasets compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: HCAL classifier effectively resolves optimization bias in traditional MTL approaches and demonstrates improved performance in hierarchical multi-label classification tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector

evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal

Conclusion: DyMixOp provides an effective framework for approximating nonlinear PDE dynamics by transforming infinite-dimensional systems into finite-dimensional latent space, successfully capturing essential nonlinear interactions and enhancing physical interpretability with superior performance.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks predict particle trajectories effectively but lack reliable uncertainty visualization, compromising trustworthiness in critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Method: Develops superelliptical uncertainty tubes integrated with established uncertainty quantification techniques (Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, SWAG) to visualize nonsymmetric uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths.

Result: Demonstrates practical utility of uncertainty tubes on both synthetic and simulation datasets, providing computationally efficient and intuitive uncertainty representation.

Conclusion: The uncertainty tube method effectively addresses the challenge of quantifying and visualizing inherent uncertainty in neural network predictions, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness in scientific applications.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this

implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

TL;DR: This paper examines two types of opacity in AI algorithms - technical complexity and intentional concealment - and explores explainable AI methods to address technical opaqueness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opaqueness of complex machine learning algorithms is a major obstacle to ethical AI development, requiring examination of different types of opacity and their ethical implications.

Method: The paper analyzes two types of opacity: technical complexity (inherent in complex algorithms like neural networks) and intentional concealment (for proprietary reasons). It then examines explanatory methods developed in computer science to overcome technical opaqueness.

Result: The analysis reveals that explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges despite various methods being developed to make AI systems more transparent.

Conclusion: Understanding the different types of opacity in AI systems is crucial for ethical development, and while XAI methods exist to address technical opaqueness, significant challenges remain in making complex algorithms truly explainable.

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

TL;DR: MuFlex is an open-source platform for benchmarking multi-building control strategies that enables synchronous EnergyPlus simulation and standardized RL implementation, demonstrating effective demand flexibility coordination across four office buildings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing building control testbeds are limited to single buildings or use simplified models that cannot capture physical intricacies, and they impose fixed formats that restrict benchmarking across diverse control scenarios.

Method: Developed MuFlex, a scalable open-source platform that enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to OpenAI Gym interface for modular RL implementation. Tested using Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with fine-tuned hyperparameters on four office buildings.

Result: Aggregating four buildings' flexibility reduced total peak demand below specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: MuFlex provides an effective platform for benchmarking multi-building flexibility coordination strategies and demonstrates that coordinated building control can successfully manage demand while preserving comfort conditions.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA is a critical public health threat requiring better forecasting models. Existing statistical/neural approaches lack epidemiological interpretability, while mechanistic models are difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models using patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters for MRSA spread.

Result: CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5% compared to machine learning baselines, enables accurate forecasts at multiple spatial resolutions, and identifies high-risk regions and cost-effective infection prevention strategies.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully combines the interpretability of mechanistic models with the predictive power of neural networks, providing a powerful tool for MRSA forecasting and policy evaluation across healthcare settings.

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We

### [193] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CROC method for genetic risk prediction combining common and rare variants, showing improved accuracy over existing methods that only use common variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genetic risk prediction models using only common variants lack sufficient accuracy for clinical use, while rare variants remain largely unexplored for risk prediction.

Method: Developed collapsing receiver operating characteristic (CROC) approach as extension of forward ROC (FROC) method, with additional procedures for handling rare variants. Evaluated using 533 SNPs from 37 candidate genes in Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data.

Result: Prediction model using all SNPs (common + rare) achieved AUC = 0.605 vs 0.585 for common variants only. CROC outperformed FROC when common variants decreased, with AUC 0.603 vs 0.524 in rare-variant-only scenario.

Conclusion: Comprehensive risk prediction strategy incorporating both common and rare variants improves accuracy. CROC method is particularly effective for rare variant analysis and shows promise for clinical genetic risk prediction.

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

TL;DR: GenHAI is a novel generative probabilistic model for predicting MRSA infection risk in hospitalized patients using probabilistic programming to answer predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA is a serious antimicrobial resistance threat, particularly dangerous for hospitalized patients due to multiple risk factors including co-morbid conditions, immunosuppression, antibiotic use, and hospital contamination risks.

Method: Developed a generative probabilistic model based on probabilistic programming paradigm to model sequences of MRSA test results during hospitalizations.

Result: The model demonstrated efficacy when compared against discriminative and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GenHAI provides hospital administrators with a powerful tool for answering important questions about MRSA infection risk mitigation through predictive, causal, and counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

*Lingyu Si,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) that unifies self-supervised contrastive learning methods, introduces ADC method for better feature space organization, and demonstrates its superiority through theoretical and empirical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and unify existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods under a common framework, and address the challenge of designing effective constraining parts without using labels to achieve better intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Method: Proposed Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) with aligning and constraining parts, analyzed BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV under this framework, and introduced Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) method to iteratively capture dynamic relationships between samples for better feature space organization.

Result: The paper demonstrates that existing SSCL methods can be unified under GLF framework, and shows that ADC method achieves superior performance in maintaining intra-class compactness and inter-class separability without using labels.

Conclusion: The proposed GLF framework successfully unifies various SSCL methods, and ADC provides an effective plug-and-play solution for improving feature space organization in self-supervised learning, with both theoretical and empirical validation of its effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of partial identification methods for causal inference, including implementation, extension of entropy-bounded methods, and empirical evaluation across diverse scenarios with practical guidance for practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial identification offers principled causal inference without strong assumptions but remains underutilized due to fragmented methods and lack of practical guidance.

Method: Implemented, extended, and unified state-of-the-art bounding algorithms (symbolic, optimization-based, information-theoretic) within common framework; extended entropy-bounded method for counterfactual queries; conducted thousands of randomized simulations with discrete/continuous data.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of methods based on bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness; developed practical decision tree for algorithm selection; trained ML model to predict best method; released open-source Python package.

Conclusion: Provides systematic framework and practical tools to make partial identification more accessible and applicable in real-world causal inference problems, addressing the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Onur Ayan,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOL enables one-shot federated learning using knowledge distillation instead of parameter sharing, allowing heterogeneous models and reducing communication overhead by transmitting predictions instead of weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FL requires uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglects resource heterogeneity, imposes heavy computational demands on clients, and increases communication overhead.

Method: FedOL employs knowledge distillation where clients exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. It introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, along with a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy.

Result: Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks with limited client computational resources.

Conclusion: FedOL provides an effective one-shot federated learning approach that handles client heterogeneity, reduces communication overhead, and enables reliable learning despite biased client predictions and lack of ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Method: T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates CLIP text embeddings via prior attention mechanism, and uses adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges textual semantics with weight-space dynamics, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural network parameter synthesis, supported by an open-source dataset of text-weight pairs.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates

hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.

*Zhuang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automatic learning rate adjustment based on stochastic gradient variation without manual hyperparameter tuning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning rate regimes are complex, require manual hyperparameter tuning, and incur high computational costs in practice

Method: Developed an explainable learning rate regime using stochastic second-order algorithms that automatically adjusts learning rate based on the norm of stochastic gradients - increases when gradient norm decreases, decreases when gradient norm increases

Result: The automatic learning rate regime shows efficiency, robustness, and scalability across different stochastic algorithms (SGD, SGDM, SIGNSGD) on machine learning tasks

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a natural and direct approach for automatic learning rate adjustment that eliminates manual parameter tuning while maintaining performance across various algorithms

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

TL;DR: FedSheafHN is a novel personalized subgraph federated learning framework that uses sheaf collaboration and hypernetworks to address client heterogeneity and improve model performance across diverse subgraph distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph federated learning faces performance variation issues due to heterogeneous local subgraph distributions across clients, requiring personalized solutions that can handle diverse data distributions effectively.

Method: The framework embeds client local subgraphs into a server-constructed collaboration graph using graph-level embeddings, employs sheaf diffusion to enrich client representations, and generates customized models through a server-optimized hypernetwork.

Result: Empirical evaluations show FedSheafHN outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets, demonstrates fast convergence, and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN successfully addresses subgraph heterogeneity in federated learning through sheaf-based collaboration and hypernetwork personalization, achieving superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

TL;DR: GRAFT is an efficient in-training subset selection method that reduces computational costs and environmental impact by selecting diverse, representative examples from low-rank feature subspaces instead of using full batches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally expensive and environmentally costly due to high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. There's a need for methods that can reduce these costs while maintaining training effectiveness.

Method: GRAFT uses a three-step approach: (1) extracts low-rank feature representations for each batch, (2) applies Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small diverse subset spanning the batch's dominant subspace, and (3) dynamically adjusts subset size using gradient-approximation criterion.

Result: GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple benchmarks, while significantly reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion: GRAFT provides a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions by operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen representative examples instead of full batches, preserving the training trajectory while reducing environmental impact.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each

GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy

*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Input Time Scaling paradigm complements existing scaling methods by focusing on query refinement strategies during both training and testing, challenging the "garbage in, garbage out" principle and showing that seemingly low-quality data can achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling focuses on data/training scaling and inference-time reasoning, but neglects input refinement strategies. The paper aims to explore how query optimization at input time can enhance performance.

Method: Proposes Input Time Scaling by combining meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies during both training and testing phases, requiring co-design approach.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on AIME24 (76.7%) and AIME25 (76.7%) with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and further improved to 80% on AIME25 with majority voting. Found that adding irrelevant information and using minimally filtered datasets can perform best.

Conclusion: Input refinement strategies are crucial for both training and testing, challenging conventional data quality assumptions. Small datasets can evoke high-level reasoning, and dataset size scaling needs careful inspection. The approach is compatible with "Less is More" phenomenon.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AutoML systems focus on hyperparameter optimization, but modern ML workflows require fine-tuning, ensembling, and adaptation techniques for pre-trained models, demanding new approaches to handle heterogeneous pipelines.

Method: Proposes PS-PFN that extends Posterior Sampling to max k-armed bandit problem, leveraging prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for efficient posterior distribution estimation via in-context learning. Handles varying costs and individual reward distributions per arm.

Result: Experimental results on one novel and two existing benchmark tasks show superior performance compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

Conclusion: PS-PFN effectively addresses the challenge of selecting and adapting modern ML pipelines, extending the CASH framework to handle contemporary ML workflows with heterogeneous components.

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

*Canzhe Zhao,Shinji Ito,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandits with FTRL approach, achieving best-of-both-worlds results for MABs and linear bandits with heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused almost exclusively on stochastic heavy-tailed bandits, with limited exceptions for MABs. There was a gap in handling adversarial regimes with heavy-tailed noise.

Method: Proposes FTRL framework with bonus-shifted loss estimates, delicate bonus function setup, and HT-SPM learning rate. Uses variance-reduced linear loss estimator for linear bandits.

Result: Achieves O~(T^{1/ε}) adversarial regret and O~(log T) stochastic regret for MABs. For linear bandits: O~(d^{1/2}T^{1/ε}) regret matching stochastic bounds. First BOBW results for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Conclusion: General framework successfully bridges adversarial and stochastic heavy-tailed bandits, providing first comprehensive solution for both MABs and linear settings with heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

*Nikolai Antonov,Prěmysl Šůcha,Mikoláš Janota,Jan Hůla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven ML approach for single-machine scheduling that outperforms traditional exact algorithms by combining machine learning with problem-specific constraints to minimize tardy job weights while ensuring solution feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exact algorithms for single-machine scheduling perform well on typical instances but deteriorate on certain problem regions, while ML approaches offer scalable performance when tailored to specific data structures.

Method: A novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics (job weight, duration, due date, deadline) to ensure feasible solutions and minimize total weight of tardy jobs, with systematic ML model exploration and selection.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, demonstrating practical flexibility.

Conclusion: The approach provides strong performance and addresses common ML algorithm challenges by ensuring solution feasibility, with detailed model selection insights that fill a gap in existing literature.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

*Jie Shi,Arno P. J. M. Siebes,Siamak Mehrkanoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trans-XFed combines federated learning with explainable AI for supply chain credit assessment, addressing privacy, data imbalance, and interpretability challenges through performance-based client selection and enhanced FedProx architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in supply chain credit assessment including privacy concerns, information silos, class imbalance, Non-IID data distribution, and lack of model interpretability.

Method: Proposes Trans-XFed architecture with performance-based client selection (PBCS) strategy, FedProx enhanced with homomorphic encryption, transformer encoder for feature insights, and integrated gradient XAI techniques.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets show Trans-XFed delivers accurate credit assessments compared to baselines while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Conclusion: Trans-XFed effectively combines federated learning and explainable AI to provide accurate, private, and interpretable credit assessment solutions for supply chain applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

### [209] [DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747)
*Noël Kury,Dmitry Kobak,Sebastian Damrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS is a new dimensionality reduction method that combines local structure preservation (like t-SNE) with global structure preservation (like PCA) through a regularization term, creating a spectrum of embeddings that balance both aspects effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods either preserve local structure (t-SNE, UMAP) or global structure (MDS, PCA) well, but none can effectively represent both aspects simultaneously for comprehensive data visualization.

Method: DREAMS combines t-SNE's local structure preservation with PCA's global structure preservation using a simple regularization term, generating a spectrum of embeddings that transition between these two extremes.

Result: Benchmarked across seven real-world datasets (including single-cell transcriptomics and population genetics), DREAMS demonstrates superior qualitative and quantitative performance in preserving structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: DREAMS successfully addresses the limitation of existing dimensionality reduction methods by providing balanced preservation of both local and global data structure, making it particularly valuable for complex high-dimensional data visualization tasks.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

### [210] [Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Sharpe Ratio Optimization in the Bandit Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13749)
*Mohammad Taha Shah,Sabrina Khurshid,Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling algorithm for Sharpe ratio maximization in stochastic bandits achieves logarithmic regret with optimal performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bandit algorithms focus on cumulative reward maximization, but Sharpe ratio optimization introduces a risk-return tradeoff requiring exploration of both mean and variance parameters.

Method: Proposed SRTS algorithm using Thompson Sampling with Gaussian reward assumption, featuring novel regret decomposition for Sharpe ratio and theoretical analysis of information acquisition.

Result: Established upper and lower regret bounds showing order-optimal logarithmic regret, with empirical simulations demonstrating superior performance over existing algorithms.

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling is effective for Sharpe ratio maximization, achieving optimal regret bounds while balancing risk and return exploration in stochastic bandits.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

### [211] [Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755)
*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Dongchun Xie,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR's potential is limited by depth and breadth constraints. DARS addresses depth neglect by re-weighting hard problems through multi-stage rollouts, while large-breadth training enhances performance. DARS-B combines both approaches for simultaneous gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR approaches suffer from systematic bias where cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights medium-accuracy samples while neglecting low-accuracy instances crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. The full potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is hindered by under-explored depth and breadth dimensions.

Method: Introduced Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts to increase positive rollouts for hard problems. Also scaled batch size aggressively and replaced PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs to address breadth limitations.

Result: DARS delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost. Large-breadth training significantly enhances Pass@1 performance and sustains high token-level entropy. DARS-B (DARS with large breadth) demonstrates simultaneous gains in both Pass@K and Pass@1 metrics.

Conclusion: Breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR. Addressing both dimensions through DARS and large-breadth training is key to unleashing the full reasoning power of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward in language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

*Tian Sun,Yuqi Chen,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PENGUIN introduces a novel attention mechanism with periodic-nested relative attention bias and grouped multi-query attention to effectively capture multiple periodic patterns in time series forecasting, outperforming both MLP and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Transformers' success in other domains, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains questionable. The paper aims to address the need for explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for better time series modeling.

Method: Proposes Periodic-Nested Group Attention (PENGUIN) with: 1) periodic-nested relative attention bias to capture periodic structures directly, and 2) grouped attention mechanism where each group targets specific periodicities using multi-query attention to handle multiple coexisting cycles.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models in long-term time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and relative attention bias for effective time series forecasting, providing a simple yet effective alternative to traditional Transformer approaches.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

TL;DR: ISP is an adaptive mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal number of clients per round in federated learning to achieve up to 30% communication savings without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck in federated learning, especially under heterogeneous and dynamic client participation, and existing methods have underexplored the problem of choosing the optimal number of clients per training round.

Method: Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP) - an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication efficiency while maintaining model accuracy.

Result: Consistent communication savings of up to 30% without compromising final model quality across diverse setups including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and training with gradient compression.

Conclusion: The selection of the number of clients should be treated as a separate and important task in federated learning, and ISP effectively addresses this challenge to improve communication efficiency.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

*Koffi Ismael Ouattara,Ioannis Krontiris,Theo Dimitrakos,Frank Kargl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First formal framework for assessing AI training dataset trustworthiness using Subjective Logic, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluation of global properties like bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems increasingly rely on training data, making dataset trustworthiness assessment critical, especially for emergent properties like fairness and bias that only appear at the dataset level.

Method: Built on Subjective Logic to support trust propositions and quantify uncertainty in scenarios with incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting evidence. Framework instantiated on bias as a trustworthiness property.

Result: Experimental evaluation on traffic sign recognition dataset shows the method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides formal, uncertainty-aware assessment of dataset-level trustworthiness properties, addressing a critical gap in AI data evaluation.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

TL;DR: Novel method combining disentangled VAE with smoothed bootstrap in latent space to address imbalanced regression problems in tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced distribution learning is a significant challenge that reduces algorithm performance, with most existing methods focused on classification rather than regression problems.

Method: Uses Variational Autoencoders to model latent representations and develops an innovative data generation approach combining disentangled VAE with smoothed bootstrap applied in the latent space.

Result: Evaluated through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for Imbalanced Regression.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective solution for imbalanced regression by leveraging latent space manipulation and data generation techniques to overcome limitations of standard approaches.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

*Mikołaj Janusz,Tomasz Wojnar,Yawei Li,Luca Benini,Kamil Adamczewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison shows one-shot pruning better at low ratios, iterative pruning superior at high ratios, leading to proposed hybrid approach


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously test the assumed superiority of iterative pruning over one-shot pruning methods and provide evidence-based guidance for practitioners

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking across structured/unstructured settings with different pruning criteria and modalities, comparing one-shot vs iterative pruning approaches

Result: Each method has specific advantages - one-shot pruning more effective at lower pruning ratios, iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios

Conclusion: Advocates for patience-based pruning and introduces a hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

### [218] [FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853)
*Nicolò Romandini,Cristian Borcea,Rebecca Montanari,Luca Foschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP is a lightweight federated unlearning algorithm that efficiently mitigates malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections in the model using only the last training round's weights, achieving effective unlearning while being faster and more storage-efficient than state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and traditional Federated Unlearning assumes trusted clients. However, with malicious and potentially colluding clients who won't cooperate in unlearning, a new approach is needed to selectively remove malicious influence without complete retraining.

Method: FedUP prunes specific connections by zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge most between benign and malicious clients' latest updates. It uses only clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit while preserving benign information.

Result: FedUP effectively reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. It works under strong adversarial conditions (up to 50% malicious clients with full knowledge of aggregation) across IID and Non-IID data, and against label-flipping and backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: FedUP provides an efficient, robust solution for federated unlearning in adversarial settings, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in speed and storage efficiency while effectively mitigating malicious client influence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

*Rouqaiah Al-Refai,Pankaja Priya Ramasamy,Ragini Ramesh,Patricia Arias-Cabarcos,Philipp Terhörst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an expert survey-based framework to evaluate biometric modalities, updating outdated 1998 standards with current technological realities and emerging vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing biometric evaluation framework from 1998 is outdated and doesn't account for recent technological advancements or emerging security vulnerabilities in authentication systems.

Method: Conducted an expert survey with 24 biometric specialists to evaluate different biometric modalities, analyzed expert agreement levels, and compared assessments with dataset-level uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets.

Result: Found substantial shifts in property ratings - face recognition improved due to technological progress, while fingerprint reliability decreased due to emerging vulnerabilities. Strong alignment between expert assessments and empirical evidence from datasets.

Conclusion: The expert survey provides reliable and updated evaluation of biometric modalities, reveals key open challenges through expert disagreements, and demonstrates the importance of integrating expert insight with empirical evidence for guiding future research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

### [220] [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOP enables effective second-order optimization at very large batch sizes by constructing variance-aware update directions using orthogonal gradient projections under the Fisher metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers struggle with very large batch sizes - first-order methods lose escape ability from sharp minima due to reduced gradient noise, while second-order methods require excessive damping that washes out curvature information.

Method: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) leverages gradients from two sub-batches to enhance the average gradient with an orthogonal component of the gradient difference under the Fisher-metric, creating variance-aware update directions.

Result: FOP restores effectiveness of second-order methods at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence.

Conclusion: FOP provides a novel solution to the large-batch optimization problem by maintaining the benefits of second-order methods while overcoming stability issues through Fisher-orthogonal gradient projections.

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFQL enables efficient one-step action generation in offline RL using Flow Matching framework, outperforming DQL while reducing training/inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) achieves strong performance but relies on computationally expensive multi-step denoising for action generation, limiting practical applications.

Method: Proposes One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL) that reformulates DQL within Flow Matching framework, learning an average velocity field for direct one-step action generation without auxiliary models or distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark show OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion baselines while substantially reducing both training and inference time.

Conclusion: OFQL successfully addresses DQL's computational limitations by enabling efficient one-step generation through Flow Matching, achieving better performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time

### [222] [Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13905)
*Tianheng Ling,Vipin Singh,Chao Qian,Felix Biessmann,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-based AI framework for sewer overflow forecasting using quantized Transformer and LSTM models on FPGA hardware, achieving energy-efficient local inference without cloud dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies extreme weather events, challenging aging sewer systems with overflow risks. Cloud-based AI solutions are unreliable during communication outages, necessitating local edge computing alternatives.

Method: Lightweight Transformer and LSTM models compressed via integer-only quantization, deployed on AMD Spartan-7 FPGA through automated hardware-aware pipeline optimizing for prediction error and energy consumption.

Result: 8-bit Transformer achieved MSE 0.0376 at 0.370 mJ per inference, while 8-bit LSTM used 0.009 mJ (40x lower energy) but with 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and longer training time.

Conclusion: Framework enables local energy-efficient forecasting for resilient sewer systems, with trade-off between LSTM (ultra-low energy) and Transformer (higher accuracy) based on deployment priorities.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

### [223] [Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13922)
*SM Mazharul Islam,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces categorical policies for multimodal behavior representation in deep RL, replacing standard Gaussian policies to enable better exploration and faster convergence in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Gaussian policies in deep RL are limited to unimodal behavior, which hinders exploration and performance in complex environments with sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or varying contexts that require multimodal strategies.

Method: Proposes categorical policies that use an intermediate categorical distribution to model multimodal behavior modes, with differentiable sampling schemes that maintain efficient gradient-based optimization while enabling discrete latent structure.

Result: Evaluation on DeepMind Control Suite environments shows that multimodal categorical policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies through better exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: Categorical distribution serves as an effective tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control, addressing limitations of traditional Gaussian policies.

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

### [224] [How Usable is Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13932)
*Bastian Schäfer,Lennart Purucker,Maciej Janowski,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of 53 automated feature engineering methods reveals they lack usability, documentation, community support, and critical constraints like time/memory limits, highlighting need for more practical AutoFE solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the usability of automated feature engineering (AutoFE) methods for practitioners, since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming but existing automation solutions haven't been evaluated for practical usability.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive survey and analysis of 53 different automated feature engineering methods, evaluating them based on usability criteria including documentation quality, community support, and constraint management capabilities.

Result: Found that AutoFE methods are generally hard to use, lack proper documentation, have no active communities, and critically lack the ability to set time and memory constraints - essential features for practical usability.

Conclusion: There is a significant need for future work on developing more usable, well-engineered automated feature engineering methods that address the practical constraints and usability requirements identified in this survey.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSP problems are fundamental in Reinforcement Learning as they can represent various cost-criteria, but existing algorithms may lack convergence guarantees or optimal performance.

Method: Developed two tabular algorithms and one function approximation algorithm specifically designed for Stochastic Shortest Path problems with asymptotic almost-sure convergence properties.

Result: Tabular algorithms outperformed other convergent RL algorithms, and the function approximation algorithm showed more reliable performance compared to existing methods in that setting.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide effective solutions for SSP problems with strong theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance advantages in both tabular and function approximation contexts.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

*Yi Yang,Kei Ikemura,Qingwen Zhang,Xiaomeng Zhu,Ci Li,Nazre Batool,Sina Sharif Mansouri,John Folkesson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoScale framework uses MTO metrics to automatically find optimal task weights for linear scalarization, eliminating expensive hyperparameter search while achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear scalarization with fixed task weights can match complex MTO methods, but it's unclear why certain weights work well and how to find them efficiently without exhaustive search.

Method: Two-phase AutoScale framework that uses MTO metrics (like gradient magnitude similarity) to guide weight selection for linear scalarization without expensive search.

Result: AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Conclusion: The connection between linear scalarization and MTO metrics enables efficient automatic weight selection, making simple scalarization competitive with complex MTO methods through intelligent weight guidance.

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new combinatorial bandit model for multi-user online advertising with cascading feedback, parallel context sessions, and heterogeneous rewards, featuring two algorithms with improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously, addressing limitations of classical contextual bandits.

Method: Proposed two algorithms: UCBBP (Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning) with O(sqrt(THN)) regret, and AUCBBP (Active UCB with Backward Planning) with improved O(sqrt(T+HN)) regret bound for better user scaling.

Result: Both algorithms achieve theoretical regret bounds and demonstrate empirical effectiveness through numerical experiments under various settings.

Conclusion: The MCCB framework successfully models multi-user advertising scenarios, and the proposed algorithms provide efficient solutions with provable performance guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of

instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

*Sergey Salishev,Ian Akhremchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel quantization method using differentiable STE with learnable parameters achieves competitive accuracy even at extreme W1A1 quantization while maintaining training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces neural network capacity as bit-width decreases, creating bottlenecks that limit performance in low-bit settings.

Method: Uses fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator with learnable bit-width, noise scale, and clamp bounds, enforced via exterior-point penalty. Includes metric smoothing through distillation for training stability.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy down to extreme W1A1 quantization setting while retaining the efficiency benefits of STE-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable quantization framework effectively addresses quantization bottlenecks and enables high-performance low-bit neural networks through learnable quantization parameters and stabilization techniques.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

*Mohammad Izadi,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer is a Transformer-based model with Mixture of Experts that achieves state-of-the-art ASD diagnosis accuracy and identifies functional connectivity biomarkers from fMRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autism Spectrum Disorder involves disrupted brain connectivity patterns that fMRI can detect. Capturing these connectivity alterations within and between functional brain communities is crucial for improving ASD diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

Method: ASDFormer uses a Transformer architecture with Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) and attention mechanisms to adaptively emphasize different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism.

Result: Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD.

Conclusion: ASDFormer shows strong potential as both a diagnostic tool and biomarker discovery platform for Autism Spectrum Disorder by effectively capturing neural signatures through its specialized expert architecture.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new typed topological space framework for analyzing 2D datasets using type-assigned open sets to reveal inner structures like tracks, components, and pseudotrees for applications in convex hull calculation, clustering, and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a topological analysis method from general topology perspective for finite datasets, moving beyond statistical and algebraic topological methods, by introducing typed topological spaces with assigned types to open sets.

Method: Developed a special set of types and related typed topology on 2D datasets, using natural quotient space organization into tracks and components that form ordered integer sequences, with components crossing tracks forming branches represented by typed-II pseudotrees.

Result: The framework reveals inner dataset structures including organized tracks, ordered components, and branch relationships through pseudotree representations, providing a platform for various computational algorithms.

Conclusion: Typed topological spaces offer a powerful new approach for analyzing finite datasets, enabling structural investigation and supporting algorithms for convex hull calculation, hole detection, clustering, and anomaly detection problems.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Efficient knowledge graph unlearning algorithm using Taylor expansion and Fisher matrices to approximate parameter changes without expensive derivative computations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for machine unlearning due to regulations like Right to be Forgotten, with KG unlearning being particularly challenging due to KG structure complexity and semantic relations between entities.

Method: Defines influence function for KG unlearning, uses Taylor expansion to estimate parameter changes, approximates inverse-Hessian vector product using Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization without constructing computational graphs.

Result: Proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines in both unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient solution for KG unlearning that avoids expensive computational overhead while maintaining high unlearning performance.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

*Dario Coscia,Pim de Haan,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLIPs is a Bayesian framework for ML interatomic potentials that provides calibrated uncertainty estimates and improves accuracy in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs lack uncertainty estimates and struggle with out-of-distribution data and data-scarce regimes, which are common in computational chemistry simulations.

Method: Scalable variational Bayesian framework using adaptive Variational Dropout, architecture-agnostic and compatible with equivariant message-passing architectures.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy over standard MLIPs, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, minimal computational overhead, and consistent gains when fine-tuning pretrained models.

Conclusion: BLIPs effectively address MLIP limitations by providing trustworthy uncertainty estimates and better performance in challenging data scenarios, making them valuable for simulation-based chemistry.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

*Jason R Brown,Carl Henrik Ek,Robert D Mullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEOPARD is a new algorithm that learns reward functions from diverse human feedback types including preferences and demonstrations, outperforming existing methods when limited feedback is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning often struggles with complex reward specification. While preference feedback and expert demonstrations can help, existing approaches combining both are often ad-hoc, domain-specific, or non-scalable.

Method: Developed reward-rational partial orderings over observations framework, then created LEOPARD algorithm that learns from various data types including negative demonstrations to efficiently learn reward functions.

Result: LEOPARD significantly outperforms existing baselines when limited preference and demonstration feedback is available. Combining multiple feedback types proves more beneficial than using single feedback types.

Conclusion: LEOPARD provides a flexible and scalable approach to learning from diverse human feedback, demonstrating the value of combining multiple feedback types for efficient reward learning in complex domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

Motivation: To better understand H-theorem's connection to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and address persistent controversies about its relation to the arrow of time.

Method: Using a DeepSets architecture model that enforces permutation invariance of particle labels to study equilibration of randomly oriented hard disks with periodic boundary conditions.

Result: The model is trained to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Deep learning approaches with built-in physical symmetries (like permutation invariance) can provide insights into fundamental thermodynamic principles and the nature of irreversibility.

TL;DR: Using LLMs to generate metadata for scientific abstract classification instead of traditional semi-supervised methods, enabling better label distinction and expert-like categorization for research management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scientific abstract classification methods struggle with sparse text and overlapping labels, while experts can easily categorize them. The paper aims to replicate expert intuition using LLMs to improve classification performance.

Method: Applied artificial intuition process using Large Language Models to generate metadata for abstracts. Used NSF abstracts to create labels and tested on Chinese National Natural Science Foundation abstracts to analyze funding trends.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of using LLM-generated metadata for scientific abstract classification, enabling effective research portfolio management and technology scouting applications.

Conclusion: LLM-based artificial intuition approach successfully replicates expert classification capabilities and provides a viable method for strategic research management activities.

Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but
challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues.
Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve
performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such
schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and
thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort
these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call
artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the
United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then
we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science
Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other
strategic activities.

TL;DR: AI tools like AlphaFold have minimal impact on interdisciplinary collaboration, increasing structural biology-computer science collaborations by only 0.48% with no effect on other disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary collaborative patterns, particularly examining the widespread belief that AI facilitates such collaborations.

Method: Analyzed 1,247 AlphaFold-related papers and 7,700 authors from Scopus using bibliometric analysis and causal inference to compare interdisciplinary collaboration between adopters and non-adopters.

Result: AlphaFold increased structural biology-computer science collaborations by just 0.48%, with no measurable effect on collaborations with other disciplines. AI creates interdisciplinary collaboration demands with specific disciplines but this is weakened by technological democratization.

Conclusion: Artificial intelligence alone has limited efficacy in bridging disciplinary divides or fostering meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: The acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) in science is recognized and
many scholars have begun to explore its role in interdisciplinary
collaboration. However, the mechanisms and extent of this impact are still
unclear. This study, using AlphaFold's impact on structural biologists,
examines how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary collaborative
patterns. By analyzing 1,247 AlphaFold-related papers and 7,700 authors from
Scopus, we employ bibliometric analysis and causal inference to compare
interdisciplinary collaboration between AlphaFold adopters and non-adopters.
Contrary to the widespread belief that AI facilitates interdisciplinary
collaboration, our findings show that AlphaFold increased structural
biology-computer science collaborations by just 0.48%, with no measurable
effect on other disciplines. Specifically, AI creates interdisciplinary
collaboration demands with specific disciplines due to its technical
characteristics, but this demand is weakened by technological democratization
and other factors. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Origami-inspired structures offer lightweight deployable systems but face design challenges due to complex nonlinear mechanics, multistability, and precise deployment force control requirements.

Method: Developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that embeds mechanical equilibrium equations directly into learning, eliminating need for pre-collected training data for both forward prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami.

Result: Model accurately predicts complete energy landscapes with minimal non-physical artifacts, enables programming of target stable-state heights and energy barriers, and successfully designs hierarchical assemblies with sequential layer-by-layer deployment through programmed barrier magnitudes.

Conclusion: Establishes a versatile, data-free approach for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami metamaterials, with broad applications in aerospace systems, morphing structures, and soft robotics.

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating
lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses.
However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics,
multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we
present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward
prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without
requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium
equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete
energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts.
The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and
separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy
curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where
sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier
magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes
validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the
robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route
for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired
metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems,
morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.

*Meng-Ping Lin,Enoch Hsin-Ho Huang,Shao-Yi Chien,Yu Tsao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel noise-suppressing cochlear implant system called AVSE-ECS that combines audio-visual speech enhancement with deep learning sound coding to improve speech comprehension in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cochlear implants struggle with speech comprehension in noisy or reverberant conditions, and deep learning offers promising opportunities to enhance sound coding capabilities by integrating visual cues for multimodal speech processing.

Method: Proposes AVSE-ECS system using audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) as pre-processing module for ElectrodeNet-CS sound coding strategy, with joint training approach for end-to-end CI system.

Result: Outperforms previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions with improved objective speech intelligibility scores.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate AVSE module into end-to-end CI systems for improved noise robustness.

Abstract: The cochlear implant (CI) is a remarkable biomedical device that successfully
enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound by
converting speech into electrical stimulation signals. Despite advancements in
the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or
reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in
deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding
capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing
methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as
auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper
introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an
audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the
deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically,
a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI
system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the
previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech
intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the
feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module
into an end-to-end CI system

### [240] [A Mechanism for Mutual Fairness in Cooperative Games with Replicable Resources -- Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13960)
*Björn Filter,Ralf Möller,Özgür Lütfü Özçep*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new fairness mechanism for collaborative AI systems that addresses the limitations of classical game theory in handling infinitely replicable resources like data and models, ensuring mutual fairness through the Balanced Reciprocity Axiom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cooperative game theory approaches (like Shapley value) fail to adequately address fairness in collaborative learning systems where data and models can be infinitely replicated, leading to potential strategic exploitation and unfair reward distributions.

Method: The authors develop a generalized notion of fairness through new axioms and mechanisms, specifically designing a mechanism that satisfies the Balanced Reciprocity Axiom to ensure equal mutual benefits between all pairs of participants.

Result: The paper presents a concrete mechanism and provides a proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, ensuring that each participant benefits equally from every other participant's contribution.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism addresses the unique challenges of infinitely replicable resources in collaborative AI systems and provides a formal foundation for fair reward allocation that prevents exploitation and ensures balanced reciprocity among all participants.

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.

*Yiyang Jia,Zheng Wei,Zheng Yang,Guohong Peng*

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: PC-GRN is a novel probabilistic framework that combines category theory, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets, and generative Bayesian inference to model Gene Regulatory Networks with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRN modeling approaches struggle to capture complex regulatory logic and manage uncertainties in both network structure and kinetic parameters.

Method: Integrates category theory for modular pathway composition, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets for stochastic process modeling, and uses GFlowNet for topology sampling plus HyperNetwork for parameter distribution inference.

Result: Provides end-to-end generative Bayesian inference that learns full posterior distributions over network models directly from data.

Conclusion: PC-GRN offers mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware GRN representations that advance predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks
(GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling
paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor
regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network
structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the
Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical
approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.
Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and
composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)
serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic
cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as
probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end
generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior
distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is
achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample
network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to
predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework
provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and
uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and
systems-level analysis.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A biologically inspired SNN training framework that combines multiple synergistic plasticity mechanisms to improve performance and robustness compared to single-mechanism approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNN training methods rely on single synaptic plasticity mechanisms, limiting adaptability and representational capability, unlike the brain which uses multiple coexisting learning strategies.

Method: Proposes a training framework incorporating multiple synergistic plasticity mechanisms that cooperatively modulate information accumulation while preserving independent update dynamics for each mechanism.

Result: Significant performance and robustness improvements demonstrated on both static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets compared to conventional single-mechanism learning models.

Conclusion: Provides a general and extensible foundation for developing more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning approaches.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

*Jianqiu Chen,Siqi Li,Xu He*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A synergistic framework combining LLM reasoning with gm/Id methodology enables efficient analog IC design automation, achieving quasi-expert quality with 10x efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog IC design is bottlenecked by experience dependency and inefficient simulations, with traditional formulas failing in advanced nodes. Direct LLM application risks guessing without engineering principles.

Method: Synergistic reasoning framework integrating LLM's strategic reasoning with physical precision of gm/Id methodology using lookup tables, making LLM a quantitative, data-driven design partner.

Result: Framework enabled Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended optimization to all PVT corners. Achieved quasi-expert quality compared to senior engineer's design with order-of-magnitude efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: Validates path for true analog design automation by combining LLM reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies, with gm/Id data being crucial for efficiency and precision.

Abstract: Analog IC design is a bottleneck due to its reliance on experience and
inefficient simulations, as traditional formulas fail in advanced nodes.
Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to this problem risks mere
"guessing" without engineering principles. We present a "synergistic reasoning"
framework that integrates an LLM's strategic reasoning with the physical
precision of the gm/Id methodology. By empowering the LLM with gm/Id lookup
tables, it becomes a quantitative, data-driven design partner.
  We validated this on a two-stage op-amp, where our framework enabled the
Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended
optimization to all PVT corners. A crucial ablation study proved gm/Id data is
key for this efficiency and precision; without it, the LLM is slower and
deviates. Compared to a senior engineer's design, our framework achieves
quasi-expert quality with an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. This
work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM
reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies.

TL;DR: EvoVerilog combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to automatically generate and optimize Verilog code for hardware design, achieving state-of-the-art performance without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for Verilog code generation require human intervention and fine-tuning, limiting scalability. Current iterative search techniques fail to explore diverse design solutions and underperform simpler methods.

Method: EvoVerilog framework combines LLM reasoning with evolutionary algorithms using multiobjective, population-based search to explore diverse Verilog design possibilities automatically.

Result: Achieved pass@10 scores of 89.1 and 80.2 on VerilogEval-Machine and VerilogEval-Human benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and ability to generate diverse functional code while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: EvoVerilog successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling automated, diverse Verilog code generation with superior performance, reducing human effort in hardware design workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in automating
the generation of Verilog hardware description language code for hardware
design. This automation is critical to reducing human effort in the complex and
error-prone process of hardware design.
  However, existing approaches predominantly rely on human intervention and
fine-tuning using curated datasets, limiting their scalability in automated
design workflows.
  Although recent iterative search techniques have emerged, they often fail to
explore diverse design solutions and may underperform simpler approaches such
as repeated prompting.
  To address these limitations, we introduce EvoVerilog, a novel framework that
combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to
automatically generate and refine Verilog code.
  EvoVerilog utilizes a multiobjective, population-based search strategy to
explore a wide range of design possibilities without requiring human
intervention.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoVerilog achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with pass@10 scores of 89.1 and 80.2 on the VerilogEval-Machine
and VerilogEval-Human benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the framework
showcases its ability to explore diverse designs by simultaneously generating a
variety of functional Verilog code while optimizing resource utilization.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A new hybrid framework called Image2Net is proposed to convert circuit diagrams to netlists for LLM-based analog IC design, achieving 80.77% success rate and 62.1-69.6% lower error than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analog ICs are mostly in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists, limiting LLM development for analog IC design. Previous conversion frameworks have limited support for image styles and circuit elements.

Method: Constructed a new dataset with rich circuit diagram styles and balanced complexity distribution. Proposed Image2Net hybrid framework for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. Introduced netlist edit distance (NED) for precise assessment.

Result: Image2Net achieves 80.77% successful rate (34.62-45.19% higher than previous works) and 0.116 averaged NED (62.1-69.6% lower than state-of-the-art methods).

Conclusion: The proposed Image2Net framework effectively converts complex circuit diagrams to netlists, enabling better LLM knowledge enrichment for analog IC design with significantly improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Piano is a floorplanning framework that simultaneously optimizes module placement and pin assignment under multiple VLSI constraints, achieving significant improvements in wirelength, feedthrough reduction, and whitespace elimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional floorplanners often overlook pin assignment with modern constraints like fixed-outline requirements and whitespace removal, which significantly impacts subsequent design stages including detailed placement and routing.

Method: Constructs a graph based on geometric relationships among modules and netlist connections, then iteratively searches for shortest paths to determine pin assignments. Uses whitespace removal strategy and three local optimizers to enhance layout metrics under multi-constraint scenarios.

Result: Achieves average 6.81% reduction in HPWL, 13.39% decrease in feedthrough wirelength, 16.36% reduction in feedthrough modules, 21.21% drop in unplaced pins, while maintaining zero whitespace on benchmark circuits.

Conclusion: Piano effectively addresses the limitations of traditional floorplanners by simultaneously optimizing module placement and pin assignment, delivering superior performance across multiple key metrics in VLSI physical design.

Abstract: Floorplanning is a critical step in VLSI physical design, increasingly
complicated by modern constraints such as fixed-outline requirements,
whitespace removal, and the presence of pre-placed modules. In addition, the
assignment of pins on module boundaries significantly impacts the performance
of subsequent stages, including detailed placement and routing. However,
traditional floorplanners often overlook pin assignment with modern constraints
during the floorplanning stage. In this work, we introduce Piano, a
floorplanning framework that simultaneously optimizes module placement and pin
assignment under multiple constraints. Specifically, we construct a graph based
on the geometric relationships among modules and their netlist connections,
then iteratively search for shortest paths to determine pin assignments. This
graph-based method also enables accurate evaluation of feedthrough and unplaced
pins, thereby guiding overall layout quality. To further improve the design, we
adopt a whitespace removal strategy and employ three local optimizers to
enhance layout metrics under multi-constraint scenarios. Experimental results
on widely used benchmark circuits demonstrate that Piano achieves an average
6.81% reduction in HPWL, a 13.39% decrease in feedthrough wirelength, a 16.36%
reduction in the number of feedthrough modules, and a 21.21% drop in unplaced
pins, while maintaining zero whitespace.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Dynamic KV cache placement across heterogeneous memory systems to maximize bandwidth utilization for LLM inference, with mathematical formulation and theoretical upper bound analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference is memory bandwidth constrained due to frequent KV cache access, and modern hardware with heterogeneous memory systems (HBM + off-package DRAM) presents opportunities for optimized cache placement.

Method: Mathematical formulation of the KV cache placement problem across heterogeneous memory systems, deriving theoretical upper bounds for bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints.

Result: Reveals substantial headroom for runtime optimization in KV cache scheduling, providing the first formal treatment of this problem in heterogeneous memory systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic KV cache placement across heterogeneous memory systems can significantly improve bandwidth utilization for LLM inference, with theoretical analysis showing considerable optimization potential.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory
bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data
movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance
of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain
accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With
advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now
integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making
heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates
dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth
utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific
scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive
a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime
optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic
KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional timing optimization in VLSI design relies heavily on manual expertise and iterative debugging, which is inefficient for modern high-speed systems where minor timing violations can cause functional failures.

Method: Parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct Signal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG), perform violation path analysis using LLMs to infer root causes, then retrieve domain-specific debugging knowledge to generate customized repair solutions.

Result: Achieved 73.68% success rate in repairing timing violations on a dataset of 54 real-world cases, outperforming LLM-only baseline (54.38%) by 19.30% improvement.

Conclusion: ViTAD effectively automates timing violation analysis and repair in RTL design, significantly reducing manual effort and improving success rates through structured analysis and domain knowledge integration.

Abstract: In modern Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design flow, the
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) stage presents a critical opportunity for timing
optimization. Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as
modern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can
lead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing
optimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to
iteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this
paper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of
timing violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.
Specifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a
Signal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation
path analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of
violations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively
retrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to
generate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source
projects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results
show that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing
violations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%. Our method improves
the success rate by 19.30%.

Conclusion: Federated learning enables effective collaboration on chip design automation while addressing critical data privacy concerns, significantly outperforming existing LLM approaches.

Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design
automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible
to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the
design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns
and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce
FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design
parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated
hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables
parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared
LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release
APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance
metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM
to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we
propose a new design evaluation metric, Chip@k, which statistically evaluates
the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria.
Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77%

*Paulo André Lima de Castro*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: AI-based Value Investing strategy called AlphaX outperforms Brazilian market benchmarks and technical indicators by addressing lookahead bias and overfitting issues in financial trading simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI trading strategies perform well in backtesting but fail in real markets due to lookahead bias and overfitting. The study aims to develop a more robust approach inspired by classical Value Investing principles.

Method: Proposed AlphaX strategy based on Value Investing paradigm. Conducted computational simulations while controlling for lookahead bias and other biases to reduce overfitting risk.

Result: AlphaX outperformed major Brazilian market benchmarks and widely used technical indicators (RSI, MFI) with statistically significant results.

Conclusion: The Value Investing-inspired approach shows promise for robust AI trading strategies, though challenges remain. Emerging qualitative analysis technologies could help develop a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework.

Abstract: Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the
field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI
techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading
financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural
networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent
advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.
Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong
performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly
referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real
markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of
risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired
by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are
highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can
significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading
conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational
simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of
overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major
Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated
superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the
Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically
significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight
emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the
development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future

### [252] [TaoSR1: The Thinking Model for E-commerce Relevance Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12365)
*Chenhe Dong,Shaowei Yao,Pengkun Jiao,Jianhui Yang,Yiming Jin,Zerui Huang,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TaoSR1 framework deploys LLMs directly for e-commerce relevance prediction using CoT reasoning, DPO optimization, and GRPO to address error accumulation and hallucination issues, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT models lack complex reasoning capabilities for query-product relevance, and existing LLM approaches use discriminative fine-tuning or distillation rather than direct deployment with reasoning.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) SFT with CoT for reasoning, 2) Offline sampling with pass@N and DPO for generation quality, 3) Dynamic sampling with GRPO to reduce hallucination, plus post-processing for efficient deployment.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online human evaluations.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification with direct LLM deployment.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

### [253] [LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500)
*Jaewan Moon,Seongmin Park,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L3AE integrates LLMs into linear autoencoders for recommendation systems, using semantic item correlations from LLMs and collaborative filtering signals with closed-form optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear autoencoders with textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics from LLMs.

Method: Two-phase optimization: (1) construct semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived representations, (2) learn item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals with semantic correlations as regularization, both using closed-form solutions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets with 27.6% gain in Recall@20 and 39.3% gain in NDCG@20.

Conclusion: L3AE successfully integrates LLM semantic knowledge with collaborative filtering through efficient closed-form optimization, achieving significant performance improvements in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

### [254] [Research on Conversational Recommender System Considering Consumer Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13209)
*Yaying Luo,Hui Fang,Zhu Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CT-CRS is a conversational recommender system that models user consumer types (dependent, efficient, cautious, expert) based on decision-making styles and knowledge levels, using LLM inference and inverse reinforcement learning to improve recommendation success and reduce interaction turns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing conversational recommender systems overlook users' heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains both accuracy and efficiency of recommendations.

Method: Proposes CT-CRS framework that: 1) defines four user categories based on consumer type theory, 2) uses interaction histories and fine-tuned LLM to infer user types in real-time, 3) incorporates user types into state representation, 4) designs type-adaptive policy for dynamic adjustment of recommendation granularity/diversity/query complexity, and 5) uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning for policy optimization.

Result: Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show CT-CRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains.

Conclusion: CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

*Qixin Wang,Dawei Wang,Kun Chen,Yaowei Hu,Puneet Girdhar,Ruoteng Wang,Aadesh Gupta,Chaitanya Devella,Wenlai Guo,Shangwen Huang,Bachir Aoun,Greg Hayworth,Han Li,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AdaptJobRec is a conversational job recommendation system that uses autonomous agents with complexity-based routing to reduce latency by up to 53.3% while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic conversational recommendation systems provide comprehensive services but suffer from high response latency, creating a need to balance complex query handling with minimal latency.

Method: Uses user query complexity identification to route simple queries directly to tools for fast responses, while complex queries go through memory filtering, intelligent task decomposition, and personalized recommendation tools.

Result: Evaluation on Walmart's career recommendation scenarios shows 53.3% reduction in average response latency compared to baselines, with significant improvement in recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec successfully balances complex query handling and latency reduction through intelligent complexity-based routing and agentic tool integration.

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

### [256] [Heterogeneous Influence Maximization in User Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13517)
*Hongru Hou,Jiachen Sun,Wenqing Lin,Wendong Bi,Xiangrong Wang,Deqing Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Two novel models (HeteroIR and HeteroIM) that bridge recommendation systems and influence maximization to improve user engagement through better invitee selection and spread coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods fail to leverage users' spread capability, while influence maximization methods ignore interaction willingness, creating a gap in effective user invitation systems.

Method: HeteroIR uses a two-stage framework to estimate spread profits, and HeteroIM incrementally selects influential invitees using reverse reachable sets for reranking based on propagation potential.

Result: Both models significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines (p-value < 0.05) and achieved 8.5% and 10% improvement respectively in Tencent's online gaming platform A/B tests.

Conclusion: The proposed models successfully bridge recommendation systems and influence maximization, demonstrating practical effectiveness in real-world deployment for enhancing user engagement through optimized invitation systems.

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

### [257] [Understanding Distribution Structure on Calibrated Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13568)
*Diego Correa da Silva,Denis Robson Dantas Boaventura,Mayki dos Santos Oliveira,Eduardo Ferreira da Silva,Joel Machado Pires,Frederico Araújo Durão*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Calibrated recommendation systems address the limitation of traditional recommenders by ensuring diverse genre representation in recommendations using multi-dimensional distribution analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems often omit less prominent genres from user profiles, creating homogeneous recommendation lists that undermine user experience by lacking diversity.

Method: Implemented 15 models to analyze three G-dimensional distributions (user profile, candidate items, recommendation list) using outlier detection techniques across three movie datasets.

Result: Outlier detection models provided better understanding of distribution structures, and calibrated systems created recommendations that maintained user preference group changes to the same degree as traditional systems.

Conclusion: Calibrated recommendation systems successfully address genre diversity while preserving the core functionality of traditional recommenders, with outlier detection models proving most effective for understanding the multi-dimensional distribution structures.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: UniECS is a unified multimodal e-commerce search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and their combinations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with parameter efficiency and real-world deployment success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems are limited by task-specific optimization with fixed modality pairings and lack comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches.

Method: Proposes a flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder using adaptive fusion mechanisms, comprehensive training strategy combining cross-modal alignment loss, cohesive local alignment loss, intra-modal contrastive loss, and adaptive loss weighting.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks, achieves up to 28% gain in R@10 for text-to-image retrieval, maintains parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters vs larger models), and shows real-world improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74%) and Revenue (+8.33%) when deployed.

Conclusion: UniECS demonstrates effectiveness in both experimental and real-world settings, providing a unified solution for multimodal e-commerce search with comprehensive benchmarking through the newly created M-BEER dataset.

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper extends synthetic query generation for neural IR using InPars Toolkit, introducing CPO-fine-tuned query generators and dynamic CoT prompts with DSPy, showing improved retrieval performance with less filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reproducibility and effectiveness of synthetic query generation pipelines for neural information retrieval by building on existing frameworks and addressing limitations in query quality and prompt optimization.

Method: Leveraged InPars Toolkit for reproducible query generation, assessed existing pipelines on SciFact benchmark, introduced CPO fine-tuning for query generator LLMs, and implemented dynamic CoT-optimized prompts using DSPy framework.

Result: Both extensions (CPO fine-tuning and dynamic CoT prompts) reduced the need for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions to synthetic query generation pipelines enhance retrieval effectiveness while requiring less filtering, with all code, models, and datasets made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large
language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original
InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,
models, and synthetic datasets are publicly released to support further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM prompting practices struggle with organizing complex prompts, integrating diverse data types, managing presentation variations, and lack proper tooling support.

Method: Introduces POML with component-based markup for logical structure, specialized data integration tags, CSS-like styling system, templating for dynamic prompts, and comprehensive developer toolkit.

Result: Validated through case studies showing improved complex application integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), plus positive user study results in real-world development.

Conclusion: POML provides a comprehensive solution for structured prompting that reduces formatting sensitivity and enhances developer productivity in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current
practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,
and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing
complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or
managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we
introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs
component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),
specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system
to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It
includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit
(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate
POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application
integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user
study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

TL;DR: LLM-based module successfully teaches prompting literacy to secondary students, improving skills and confidence with AI chatbots through classroom deployments and AI auto-grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need to equip K-12 students with responsible AI interaction skills as AI becomes integrated into daily life, addressing educator demand for teaching ethical and effective AI use.

Method: Designed LLM-based module with scenario-based deliberate practice activities involving direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents. Conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 secondary classrooms, evaluating AI auto-grader capability, student prompting performance, confidence changes, and material quality.

Result: AI auto-grader could grade student prompts with satisfactory quality. Instructional materials improved students' prompting skills and led to positive perception shifts about AI for learning. True/False and open-ended questions proved more effective than multiple-choice for measuring prompting literacy.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for broader deployment, demonstrating effective teaching of responsible AI engagement to secondary students, with need for further studies on learning effectiveness and assessment design.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to
apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.
Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach
students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this
need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting
literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with
direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary
school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two
iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education
classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'
prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and
3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the
AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory
quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in
improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in
their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1
informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and
discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could
measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for
our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for
broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess
learning effectiveness and assessment design.

### [262] [Combating Homelessness Stigma with LLMs: A New Multi-Modal Dataset for Bias Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13187)
*Jonathan A. Karr Jr.,Benjamin F. Herbst,Ting Hua,Matthew Hauenstein,Georgina Curto,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces NLP and LLM methods to detect and measure social bias against people experiencing homelessness (PEH) in online discourse, using a novel multi-modal dataset from various digital sources across 10 U.S. cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Homelessness affects over 770,000 people in the U.S. with social stigmatization being a major barrier to alleviation. Online discourse reflects public opinion and biases, making it valuable for identifying and tracking social biases to inform policy and shift public perception.

Method: Created a manually-annotated multi-modal dataset from Reddit, X, news articles, and city council meetings across 10 U.S. cities. Evaluated LLMs (both local and closed-source) using zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques to automate bias detection, comparing performance against BERT.

Result: Local LLMs showed significant inconsistencies in zero-shot classification but their few-shot performance approached closed-source LLMs. Overall, LLMs outperformed BERT across all bias categories. The dataset confirmed existing homelessness bias typologies from literature.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates LLMs' potential for scalable bias detection in homelessness discourse, aiming to raise awareness, inform policy through new indicators, and enhance fairness in Generative AI applications.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

TL;DR: Africa faces unique AI risks including electoral interference via deepfakes, data colonialism, compute scarcity, labor disruption, and climate impacts. The paper proposes a 5-point action plan for AI safety governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African perspectives have been excluded from global AI safety debates, leaving the continent vulnerable to specific AI risks without adequate representation in governance frameworks.

Method: The paper analyzes Africa's distinctive AI risk profile and proposes a comprehensive action plan including policy approaches, institutional establishment, public awareness, early warning systems, and regional forums.

Result: Identified critical AI safety gaps in Africa including lack of dedicated AI safety institutions, limited influence in global governance, and specific vulnerability patterns across electoral, economic, and environmental domains.

Conclusion: Urgent need for African-centered AI safety governance through institutional development, policy frameworks, public education, and regional cooperation to address continent-specific risks and ensure equitable participation in global AI governance.

Abstract: This paper maps Africa's distinctive AI risk profile, from deepfake fuelled
electoral interference and data colonial dependency to compute scarcity, labour
disruption and disproportionate exposure to climate driven environmental costs.
While major benefits are promised to accrue, the availability, development and
adoption of AI also mean that African people and countries face particular AI
safety risks, from large scale labour market disruptions to the nefarious use
of AI to manipulate public opinion. To date, African perspectives have not been
meaningfully integrated into global debates and processes regarding AI safety,
leaving African stakeholders with limited influence over the emerging global AI
safety governance agenda. While there are Computer Incident Response Teams on
the continent, none hosts a dedicated AI Safety Institute or office. We propose
a five-point action plan centred on (i) a policy approach that foregrounds the
protection of the human rights of those most vulnerable to experiencing the
harmful socio-economic effects of AI; (ii) the establishment of an African AI
Safety Institute; (iii) promote public AI literacy and awareness; (iv)
development of early warning system with inclusive benchmark suites for 25+

### [265] [The Course Difficulty Analysis Cookbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13218)
*Frederik Baucks,Robin Schmucker,Laurenz Wiskott*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Comprehensive review and comparison of course difficulty assessment methods using GPA and latent trait modeling, with practical applications for curriculum analytics and educational equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide fair, representative course difficulty measures independent of student performance bias, enabling quality control, course comparisons, and equitable learning experiences.

Method: Review and comparison of existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point averages and latent trait modeling, including model selection and assumption checking.

Result: Development of a framework for reliable and valid course difficulty measurement that accounts for student diversity and covariates, with applications for monitoring difficulty over time and detecting disparate outcomes.

Conclusion: The paper provides essential tools and methodologies for robust course difficulty assessment, promoting high-quality, fair, and equitable educational experiences through open-source software and reproducible approaches.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to
ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying
course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative
difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality
control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g.,
articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course
difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when
difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled
students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By
assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can
reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of
difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement
must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses.
Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the
characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g.,
transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been
proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of
existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point
averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on
model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These
applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting
courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g.,
dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and
equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we
provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating
reproducibility and adoption.

### [266] [Consumer Autonomy or Illusion? Rethinking Consumer Agency in the Age of Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13440)
*Pegah Nokhiz,Aravinda Kanchana Ruwanpathirana*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Digital ecosystems constrain consumer agency through obligatory consumption, algorithmic manipulation, and unstable work schedules, leading to financial instability even for rational agents. Formal modeling shows agency limitations cause measurable financial risks, requiring systemic interventions and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer agency is increasingly constrained by systemic barriers and algorithmic manipulation in the digital age, raising concerns about the authenticity of consumption choices and financial autonomy being eroded by external pressures.

Method: Examine formal models grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. Construct analytical scenarios where consumers face obligatory payments, algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to temporal instability.

Result: Even rational, utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions. Diminished autonomy significantly impacts long-term financial well-being.

Conclusion: Consumer agency must be treated as a value requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. Systemic interventions and consumer education can strengthen agency and support value deliberation and informed choices.

Abstract: Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic
barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity
of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external
pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable
work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like
hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like
personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work
schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how
these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models
grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We
construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,
algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to
temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,
utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is
limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how
diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central
argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)
requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection
between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that
limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be
rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This
connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,
by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As
solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support
value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these
measures strengthen agency.

### [267] [The AI Risk Spectrum: From Dangerous Capabilities to Existential Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13700)
*Markov Grey,Charbel-Raphaël Segerie*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Comprehensive mapping of AI risks across three categories: misuse (deliberate harm), misalignment (value conflicts), and systemic risks (social integration issues), with risk amplifiers that increase severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more capable and widespread, understanding the full spectrum of associated risks from current harms to existential threats is increasingly important for navigating future challenges.

Method: Organizes AI risks into three causal categories and identifies risk amplifiers, connecting current observable AI behaviors to plausible future catastrophic outcomes through systematic risk mapping.

Result: Provides a complete landscape of AI risks demonstrating how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes, including bioweapons, cyberattacks, value misalignment, power concentration, and human enfeeblement.

Conclusion: Good AI futures are possible but don't happen by default - navigating these challenges requires unprecedented coordination, though an extraordinary future awaits if successful risk management is achieved.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, integrated, and widespread, understanding
the associated risks becomes increasingly important. This paper maps the full
spectrum of AI risks, from current harms affecting individual users to
existential threats that could endanger humanity's survival. We organize these
risks into three main causal categories. Misuse risks, which occur when people
deliberately use AI for harmful purposes - creating bioweapons, launching
cyberattacks, adversarial AI attacks or deploying lethal autonomous weapons.
Misalignment risks happen when AI systems pursue outcomes that conflict with
human values, irrespective of developer intentions. This includes risks arising
through specification gaming (reward hacking), scheming and power-seeking
tendencies in pursuit of long-term strategic goals. Systemic risks, which arise
when AI integrates into complex social systems in ways that gradually undermine
human agency - concentrating power, accelerating political and economic
disempowerment, creating overdependence that leads to human enfeeblement, or
irreversibly locking in current values curtailing future moral progress. Beyond
these core categories, we identify risk amplifiers - competitive pressures,
accidents, corporate indifference, and coordination failures - that make all
risks more likely and severe. Throughout, we connect today's existing risks and
empirically observable AI behaviors to plausible future outcomes, demonstrating
how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes. Our goal is to
help readers understand the complete landscape of AI risks. Good futures are
possible, but they don't happen by default. Navigating these challenges will
require unprecedented coordination, but an extraordinary future awaits if we
do.

### [268] [Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy for Reliable Pulmonary Nodule Detection on Chest X-Ray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13236)
*Hyeonjin Choi,Jinse Kim,Dong-yeon Yoo,Ju-sung Sun,Jung-won Lee*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy to improve medical AI trust by learning physicians' background knowledge alongside lesion data, achieving 92% accuracy with 10% sensitivity improvement and reduced uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physicians' trust in medical AI is limited due to diagnostic uncertainty concerns. AI lacks physicians' extensive background knowledge and clinical experience, relying only on lesion data learning.

Method: Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that learns physicians' background knowledge in addition to chest X-ray lesion information. Used 2,517 lesion-free and 656 nodule images from Ajou University Hospital.

Result: Model achieved 92% accuracy (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with 10% sensitivity improvement over baseline. Reduced entropy (uncertainty measure) by 0.2.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses knowledge deficiency in medical AI by incorporating physicians' background knowledge, leading to improved performance and reduced diagnostic uncertainty.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework using 3D pCASL MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that quantify cerebrovascular health and disease susceptibility through supervoxel clustering and CNN-based classification with 95% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand normative brain perfusion patterns, capture sex-specific differences in cerebrovascular health, and develop early detection methods for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Method: Uses 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI to parcellate brain into homogeneous perfusion regions via supervoxel clustering. Extracts mean cerebral blood flow values from 186 healthy participants and trains a custom convolutional neural network for sex classification.

Result: Achieved 95% accuracy in sex classification, highlighting robust sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain. Also systematically evaluated regional CBF variations and age-related effects within male and female cohorts.

Conclusion: The vascular risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and aging, potentially facilitating early detection and personalized interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial
spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that
quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain
is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using
supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular
contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186
cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional
neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This
highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain.
Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are
systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular
risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and
aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Conclusion: GPT-5 delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving, highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and therapeutic physics.

Abstract: Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making
that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under
high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to
assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into
measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for
visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated,
multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated
Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice
questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality
assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with
substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions
such as the chest-mediastinal, +13.60% in lung-focused questions, and +11.44%
in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5
attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing
threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5

*Leander Melroy Maben,Keerthana Prasad,Shyamala Guruvare,Vidya Kudva,P C Siddalingaswamy*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI-powered automated cervical cancer screening using lightweight deep learning models for visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer causes high mortality in low/middle-income countries despite being treatable. VIA screening is affordable but subjective and requires trained professionals. AI automation can eliminate subjectivity and enable task shifting to less trained workers.

Method: Lightweight deep learning algorithm combining EfficientDet-Lite3 for Region of Interest detection and MobileNet-V2 based model for classification, deployed on Android devices for remote operation without internet.

Result: Classification model achieved 92.31% accuracy, 98.24% sensitivity, and 88.37% specificity on test dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed system presents a promising automated low-resource screening approach that can operate without highly-trained professionals, labs, or sophisticated infrastructure.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

*Maria Popa,Gabriela Adriana Visa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First publicly available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation with MRI scans from 13 patients including ADEM cases, plus comprehensive metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric demyelinating disorders beyond Multiple Sclerosis, despite MRI being crucial for diagnosis and monitoring.

Method: Collected and curated MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients with demyelinating disorders (including 3 ADEM cases), created lesion segmentation masks, and compiled extensive patient metadata including diagnosis, treatment, and lab results.

Result: Evaluated a state-of-the-art lesion segmentation model trained on existing MS dataset, demonstrating the dataset's relevance and highlighting the importance of diverse training data.

Conclusion: The pediatric demyelinating lesion segmentation dataset fills a critical gap and underscores the need for diverse datasets to improve diagnostic models for various demyelinating disorders.

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

*Shuxin Liang,Yihan Xiao,Wenlu Tang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian Splatting approach that reconstructs internal scenes and volumetric densities from sparse sliced data without requiring camera poses, with CUDA implementation available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods focus primarily on external surface modeling, but many applications require understanding object interiors. The authors aim to address the reconstruction of internal scenes which is crucial for comprehensive object analysis.

Method: The method directly models continuous volumetric density through inner 3D Gaussian distribution, enabling reconstruction of smooth internal structures from sparse sliced data. The approach is plug-and-play, eliminates the need for camera poses, and is compatible with any data modalities.

Result: The model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures, demonstrating successful internal scene reconstruction capabilities that go beyond surface-only modeling.

Conclusion: This work extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to internal scene reconstruction, providing a versatile solution for volumetric density modeling that works with sparse data and various modalities without camera pose requirements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

*Sedigheh Dargahi,Sylvain Bouix,Christian Desrosier*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning method corrects susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI using only single-direction acquisition instead of requiring paired blip-up/blip-down images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional correction methods like topup require both blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting applicability to retrospective data with single phase encoding direction.

Method: Proposed deep learning-based approach that uses only a single acquisition (either blip-up or blip-down) to correct susceptibility-induced distortions.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to traditional topup method while eliminating the need for paired acquisitions.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility distortion correction in diffusion MRI, making the technique more widely applicable.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

*Pei Liu,Luping Ji,Jiaxiang Gou,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Path-PKT, the first systematic study on prognostic knowledge transfer between different cancers using whole-slide images, addressing limitations of cancer-specific models by enabling knowledge sharing across cancers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSI-based prognosis models are cancer-specific and cannot leverage prognostic knowledge from other cancers, limiting their effectiveness for rare tumors and preventing cross-cancer knowledge generalization.

Method: The study curates a large multi-cancer dataset (UNI2-h-DSS with 13 cancers), designs experiments to understand knowledge transfer factors, and proposes MoE-PKT with a routing mechanism to utilize generalizable prognostic knowledge across cancers.

Result: The research demonstrates transferability of prognostic knowledge between different cancers and shows that source models can be effectively transferred to rare tumor diseases, providing computational evidence of cross-cancer knowledge sharing.

Conclusion: Path-PKT lays solid foundations for prognostic knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis, enabling models to benefit from generalizable knowledge across multiple cancers and improving performance for rare diseases with limited samples.

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Systematic review of 46 abdominal CT datasets (50,256 studies) reveals significant redundancy (59.1% case reuse), Western geographic bias (75.3% from NA/Europe), and high prevalence of domain shift (63%) and selection bias (57%) in larger datasets, undermining AI model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the suitability of publicly available abdominal CT datasets for AI applications in clinical settings and identify biases that may limit model generalizability across diverse healthcare environments.

Method: Systematic review and critical evaluation of 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets totaling 50,256 studies, with bias assessment performed on the 19 datasets containing >=100 cases.

Result: Found substantial redundancy (59.1% case reuse), Western geographic skew (75.3% from North America and Europe), and high prevalence of domain shift (63%) and selection bias (57%) in larger datasets, which may undermine model generalizability.

Conclusion: Proposes targeted strategies including multi-institutional collaboration, standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of diverse patient populations and imaging technologies to develop more equitable and clinically robust AI models for abdominal imaging.

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

*Jacob Hanimann,Daniel Siegismund,Mario Wieser,Stephan Steigele*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Zero-shot cell segmentation using foundation model with self-prompting mechanism for nuclei, cell, and subcellular segmentation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cell segmentation methods require extensive manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and limits scalability in high-throughput drug discovery screening.

Method: Three-step process using segmentation foundation model in zero-shot setting with in-context learning strategy. Self-prompting mechanism encodes morphological and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed foreground/background points.

Result: Method accurately segments biologically relevant structures on both standard benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays without dataset-specific tuning.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective cell segmentation without the need for manual parameter tuning or fine-tuning, making it highly suitable for high-throughput drug discovery applications.

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

*Tiago Assis,Ines P. Machado,Benjamin Zwick,Nuno C. Garcia,Reuben Dorent*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that uses biomechanical simulations to generate dense, physically plausible brain deformations from sparse keypoints, significantly outperforming classical interpolation methods with half the mean square error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain shift compensation is critical for neuronavigation during neurosurgery. Keypoint-based registration methods are robust but rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore tissue biomechanics, leading to less accurate dense displacement fields.

Method: Generate large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations, then train a residual 3D U-Net to refine standard interpolation estimates into biomechanically guided deformations from sparse matched keypoints.

Result: Experiments on simulated displacement fields show the method significantly outperforms classical interpolators, reducing mean square error by half while adding negligible computational overhead at inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework successfully incorporates biomechanical principles to create more accurate and physically plausible brain deformation fields from sparse keypoint matches, improving neuronavigation reliability during neurosurgery.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Diffusion models can synthesize contrast-enhanced breast MRI from pre-contrast scans, potentially reducing need for contrast agents while maintaining diagnostic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate safety concerns, contraindications, costs, and workflow complexity associated with contrast agents in breast DCE-MRI by generating synthetic contrast-enhanced images.

Method: Pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models with 22 variants, including tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning in single-breast and full breast settings.

Result: Subtraction image-based models outperformed post-contrast-based models across 5 evaluation metrics. Tumor-aware losses and segmentation masks improved ROI evaluation. Reader study confirmed high realism with 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists.

Conclusion: Generative contrast-enhancement shows emerging clinical potential for breast MRI, though tumor localization inputs may not always be available in screening settings.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our

TL;DR: CaLID is a novel cardiac latent interpolation diffusion framework that enables efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse 2D CMR slices without requiring additional inputs like segmentation or motion data, achieving 24x speedup and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMR imaging is limited by sparse 2D slice acquisition, leading to incomplete volumetric information. Existing methods suffer from predefined interpolation schemes, computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic inputs.

Method: Proposes a data-driven interpolation scheme using diffusion models in latent space, enabling efficient 3D whole-heart upsampling. Extends to 2D+T data for spatiotemporal modeling with temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves 24x speedup in reconstruction time, eliminates need for auxiliary inputs, and demonstrates superior reconstruction quality and efficiency in volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CaLID advances spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart reconstruction, providing a robust and clinically practical solution for cardiovascular imaging by addressing fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel video steganography method using Genetic Algorithm for ROI detection and AES encryption, achieving high PSNR (64-75 dB) and fast encoding/decoding for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing need for secure data transmission over internet requires effective steganography methods that maintain video quality while ensuring data security and privacy.

Method: Uses Genetic Algorithm to identify optimal Region of Interest (ROI) in video, encrypts secret data with AES, and embeds data using up to 10% of cover video capacity.

Result: Achieves high embedding capacity with PSNR values between 64-75 dB, indicating minimal visual distortion, and demonstrates fast encoding/decoding performance suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and secure video steganography solution with excellent visual quality preservation and practical performance for real-world deployment.

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to
ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an
intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique
that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of
any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering
the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper
proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the
cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for
data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being
embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This
process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The
performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that
the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR
ranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost
indistinguishable from the original video. Additionally, the method can encode
and decode data quickly, making it efficient for real time applications.

TL;DR: AI-powered real-time segmentation system for Circle of Willis using TCCD ultrasound, achieving high accuracy (Dice 0.901) to reduce operator dependency in cerebrovascular screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TCCD assessments for Circle of Willis evaluation depend heavily on operator expertise for anatomical landmark identification and angle correction, limiting widespread adoption despite the method's radiation-free, affordable, and accessible advantages.

Method: Proposed Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network tailored for TCCD data, trained on 738 annotated frames with 3,419 labeled artery instances for real-time brain vessel segmentation in Circle of Willis.

Result: AAW-YOLO achieved excellent performance: Dice score 0.901, IoU 0.823, precision 0.882, recall 0.926, mAP 0.953, with per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms for both ipsilateral and contralateral vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: The system provides a practical solution to reduce operator dependency in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with potential for clinical workflows and resource-constrained settings. Future work will explore bilateral modeling and larger validation.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine vision systems are vulnerable to laser flare that can blind or permanently damage sensors through oversaturation. Existing protection methods are limited and don't provide full-spectrum coverage.

Method: Jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. Uses adversarial end-to-end training on 100K images and distributed computing with heterogeneous data parallelism.

Result: Suppresses laser irradiance up to 10^6 times sensor saturation threshold. Achieves 10.1% improvement in restored image quality compared to other learned DOEs. Enables full-spectrum imaging with laser suppression for the first time.

Conclusion: NeuSee provides effective sensor protection against high-intensity lasers while maintaining high-fidelity imaging across the entire visible spectrum, addressing dynamic real-world conditions including varying laser parameters and ambient lighting.

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum
imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in

TL;DR: MMIS-Net leverages multiple medical image datasets across modalities and organs using Similarity Fusion blocks and one-hot label space, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance on unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most medical image segmentation methods use single-source data, missing the synergistic potential of numerous available annotated datasets from different modalities, organs, and diseases.

Method: Proposed MMIS-Net with Similarity Fusion blocks for supervision and pixel-wise similarity knowledge selection, plus one-hot label space to handle inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions across datasets.

Result: Achieved best mean Dice score of 0.83 and absolute volume difference of 0.035 for fluids segmentation, and perfect AUC of 1 for fluid detection on RETOUCH challenge test set, outperforming foundation models and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Similarity Fusion blocks and one-hot label space effectively address multi-dataset training challenges, demonstrating superior performance in medical image segmentation by leveraging diverse annotated datasets.

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical

are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the

Motivation: Medical imaging faces data scarcity challenges for pre-training foundation models across every domain, modality, or task. Continual learning offers a solution by enabling sequential fine-tuning without requiring large datasets for each training phase.

Method: Proposed UNIfied CONtinual Learning (UNICON) framework that provides a unified, perpetually expandable approach for adapting foundation models across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives through careful integration techniques.

Result: Adapted a chest CT foundation model to prognosis and segmentation tasks with improved performance. Continually incorporated PET scans achieving 5% improvement in Dice score compared to baselines. Demonstrated ability to expand across modalities without catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Foundation models are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve through continual learning, paving the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model (Diff-MSM) enables end-to-end automatic differentiation to simultaneously identify muscle and bone parameters without measuring internal joint torques, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for simulating realistic human-robot interactions and verifying safety-critical applications, but identifying subject-specific parameters is challenging due to difficulty measuring internal biomechanical variables.

Method: Proposed Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model (Diff-MSM) using end-to-end automatic differentiation technique that differentiates from measurable muscle activation through joint torque to observable motion, eliminating need to measure internal joint torques.

Result: Significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving average percentage errors as low as 0.05% for muscle parameter estimation when initial guess was sampled from normal distribution with mean as ground truth and 10% standard deviation.

Conclusion: The Diff-MSM parameter identification technique has great potential for applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports science beyond human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates effective real-time surveillance with voice interaction using off-the-shelf hardware and open software, with potential for extensions like sensor fusion, GPU acceleration, and additional recognition capabilities

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU

### [290] [ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488)
*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER is a loop closure verification method that uses historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loop detections in repetitive environments where appearance-based methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loop closure verification methods focus on appearance features but neglect spatial-temporal motion cues (trajectory), making them vulnerable to false positives in repetitive environments with high visual similarity.

Method: For each loop candidate, ROVER first estimates the robot trajectory using pose-graph optimization, then scores its compliance with the trajectory prior (without the loop) to determine if the candidate should be accepted.

Result: Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments demonstrate ROVER's effectiveness in rejecting false loops. Integration into state-of-the-art SLAM systems verifies its robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ROVER successfully leverages trajectory prior knowledge as a constraint for loop closure verification, providing a reliable solution for challenging repetitive environments where traditional appearance-based methods struggle.

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching robots through human video imitation provides intuitive learning and scalable alternative to labor-intensive teleoperation data collection, but current robots struggle with generalization across geometrically diverse but functionally similar tools.

Method: Proposes MimicFunc framework that uses function frames - function-centric local coordinate frames constructed with keypoint-based abstraction to establish functional correspondences for imitating tool manipulation skills.

Result: Experiments show MimicFunc effectively enables robots to generalize skills from single RGB-D human videos to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks, and generated rollouts can train visuomotor policies without teleoperation data.

Conclusion: MimicFunc successfully addresses the challenge of intra-function variations in tools through function-level correspondences, enabling one-shot generalization of tool manipulation skills from human videos to diverse novel tools.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing storage architectures and retrieval paradigms for Embodied AI data management, identifying key bottlenecks and proposing future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents generate vast heterogeneous multimodal data that traditional systems cannot handle effectively, requiring specialized data management solutions.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 5 storage architectures and 5 retrieval paradigms based on comprehensive review of 180+ studies, focusing on EAI requirements like physical grounding and low-latency access.

Result: Identified fundamental tension between semantic coherence and real-time responsiveness, and key bottlenecks including Physical Grounding Gap, cross-modal integration challenges, dynamic adaptation issues, and open-world generalization problems.

Conclusion: Proposes research agenda with physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking to develop robust data management frameworks for next-generation autonomous embodied systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than
180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,
high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation
of autonomous embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs in sheet-metal workshops struggle with high-mix-low-volume production where standard automation fails, leading to costly manual labor and underutilization of skilled workforce.

Method: Integration of existing technologies including 3D object recognition and localization to enhance cobotic systems, with implementation insights from a past project collaboration between ACRO research unit and an industrial partner.

Result: The project outlines key steps and explores both opportunities and challenges of implementing mobile, reconfigurable cobotic assistants in industrial settings.

Conclusion: The COOCK+ ROBUST project demonstrates potential for transforming cobots into effective production assistants through technology integration, addressing automation gaps in high-mix-low-volume manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Embodied-R1, a 3B VLM using pointing as unified representation with RFT training, achieves SOTA on 11 benchmarks and 56.2% zero-shot success in SIMPLEREnv.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'seeing-to-doing gap' in embodied AI caused by data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity through a unified pointing representation.

Method: Develop Embodied-R1 VLM using pointing as embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation. Create Embodied-Points-200K dataset and train with two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with multi-task rewards.

Result: State-of-the-art on 11 embodied spatial benchmarks, 56.2% zero-shot success in SIMPLEREnv, 87.5% success on 8 real-world XArm tasks (62% improvement over baselines), high robustness against visual disturbances.

Conclusion: Pointing-centric representation with RFT training provides effective and generalizable pathway to close perception-action gap in robotics.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

*Rathnam Vidushika Rasanji,Jin Wei-Kocsis,Jiansong Zhang,Dongming Gan,Ragu Athinarayanan,Paul Asunda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SGDT integrates neuro-symbolic planning with Decision Transformers for multi-robot manipulation, enabling hierarchical, interpretable decision-making in complex collaboration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL's data-intensive nature and MDP limitations hinder practical deployment in multi-robot manipulation with complex dynamics. Decision Transformers show promise but remain underexplored for multi-robot applications.

Method: Hierarchical framework with neuro-symbolic planner generating symbolic subgoals, guiding a goal-conditioned decision transformer for low-level sequential decision-making in multi-robot manipulation.

Result: Evaluated across zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, demonstrating structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: First DT-based approach for multi-robot manipulation, successfully combining neuro-symbolic mechanisms with transformers to address complex collaboration challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

*Sydney Thompson,Kate Candon,Marynel Vázquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inconsistent use of 'social context' in HRI research by surveying existing definitions, proposing a conceptual model, and identifying key attributes to help researchers design and evaluate robot behavior more systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The HRI community uses the term 'social context' in varied and inconsistent ways, leading to miscommunication and making it difficult to connect related work on understanding and modeling social contexts in human-robot interactions.

Method: The authors surveyed HRI literature for existing definitions of 'social context', proposed a conceptual model for describing social context in human-robot interactions, and applied this model to analyze existing work while identifying key attributes.

Result: The paper develops a conceptual model that can help researchers plan interactions, develop robot behavior models, and gain insights after interactions. It identifies a range of attributes that characterize social contexts in HRI.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a framework for more systematic understanding and modeling of social contexts in HRI, though open research questions remain in this area that require further investigation.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Motivation: To transform the traditional laborious process of MOF candidate enumeration into an efficient, AI-driven generative approach that can autonomously propose and synthesize new porous reticular structures on demand.

Method: Employing deep learning models including variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and large language model-based agents, combined with high-throughput computational screening and automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines.

Result: Creation of a new paradigm for reticular chemistry where AI algorithms efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications.

Conclusion: While generative AI shows transformative potential in MOF discovery, challenges remain including synthetic feasibility, dataset diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge to fully realize this accelerated discovery approach.

Abstract: Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective
introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative
approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new
porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing
deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and
large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of
available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials
designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput
computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,
closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular
chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for
high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,
we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset
diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

Motivation: Traditional manual analysis workflows are inadequate for multimodal single-cell omics data, and the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders AI agent development in this field.

Method: Developed a benchmarking evaluation system with: 1) unified platform for diverse agent frameworks/LLMs, 2) multidimensional metrics assessing various capabilities, 3) 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks across multiple dimensions.

Result: Grok-3-beta achieved state-of-the-art performance; multi-agent frameworks outperformed single-agent approaches; code generation quality is crucial for success; self-reflection had the most significant impact, followed by RAG and planning.

Conclusion: The work identifies persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and knowledge retrieval, providing empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.

Abstract: The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in
traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm
shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable
decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive
benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking
evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics
analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse
agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program
synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge
integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell
omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing
technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art
performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly
enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches
through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities
identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and
self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights
persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and

Motivation: Modern AI alignment tools like Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization rely on Plackett-Luce model assumptions, but its connection to classical statistical models like Cox Proportional Hazards hasn't been thoroughly explored.

Method: Theoretical analysis connecting the mathematical foundations and statistical assumptions of Plackett-Luce model with Cox Proportional Hazards model.

Result: Establishes a formal connection between these two statistical models, revealing insights about the underlying assumptions in preference estimation from human-annotated data.

Conclusion: The connection between Plackett-Luce and Cox Proportional Hazards models provides new perspectives on the statistical foundations of modern AI alignment techniques and their implications for preference estimation.

Abstract: Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically
involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the
Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling
and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions
posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the

*Vladimir Berman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A deterministic framework for leading digit distributions based on arithmetic and structural properties rather than probabilistic models, with explicit solutions explaining diverse digit patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional probabilistic explanations and provide a mathematical foundation that explains the observed diversity of leading digit distributions in various datasets.

Method: Uses shift-invariant functional equations with explicit affine-plus-periodic solutions to analyze digit distributions in finite/infinite datasets, deterministic sequences, and mathematical structures.

Result: Establishes a unified mathematical foundation that explains diverse digit patterns, including deviations from logarithmic profiles, and provides tools for analyzing digital phenomena.

Conclusion: The framework offers a versatile deterministic approach for modeling digit distributions, addresses limitations of probabilistic models, and provides direction for future research in digital analysis.

Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of
leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying
on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that
the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying
arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating
process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose
general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This
structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions
encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with
pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite
datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence
relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal
features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models,
explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open
problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified
mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset
for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new ensemble flow filter (EnFF) using flow matching for faster data assimilation with flexible probability paths, outperforming existing methods in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative modeling approaches for data assimilation like ensemble score filter (EnSF) suffer from slow sampling and computational burden, especially in high-dimensional nonlinear systems.

Method: Proposes ensemble flow filter (EnFF) based on flow matching - a training-free approach that integrates MC estimators for marginal flow matching vector field with localized guidance to assimilate observations.

Result: EnFF demonstrates faster sampling, more flexible vector field design, improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs, and ability to leverage larger ensembles compared to prior methods on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks.

Conclusion: Flow matching shows promise as a scalable tool for high-dimensional filtering applications, enabling the use of large ensembles and encompassing classical filtering methods as special cases.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of
a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative
modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear
settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a
significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we
introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the
ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible
design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates
MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to
assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF
design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show
that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap
particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on
high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy
tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our
results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in
high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional data analysis faces challenges like privacy constraints, sparse/irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures that hinder effective statistical analysis.

Method: SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow based on flow-matching ideas to generate infinite-dimensional functional data without Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions, handling irregular observations while ensuring smoothness.

Result: Extensive simulations show SFM's advantages in synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. Application to MIMIC-IV EHR data demonstrates high-quality surrogate generation for downstream statistical tasks.

Conclusion: SFM provides a practical and flexible solution for functional data generation where existing deep generative methods fail, boosting EHR data utility for clinical applications.

Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous
domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health
informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for
functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints,
sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian
structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named
Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data
to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon
flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate
infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank
assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations,
and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical
and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are
not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the
advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational
efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the
MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our
analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data
for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the
utility of EHR data for clinical applications.

*Kangdao Liu,Huajun Xi,Chi-Man Vong,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (OCS-ARC) extends conformal selection to irreversible online decision-making, controlling false discovery rate while improving selection power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal selection works well offline but fails in online scenarios where irreversible decisions are needed (e.g., drug discovery), as it allows deselection of previously selected candidates.

Method: Proposes OCS-ARC that incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, allowing reconsideration of non-selected points but making selection decisions irreversible once made.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show FDR control at nominal level under i.i.d. and exchangeable data, with experiments demonstrating significant power improvement over baselines while maintaining valid FDR control.

Conclusion: OCS-ARC successfully addresses the limitation of traditional conformal selection in online irreversible decision scenarios, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance improvements.

Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial
across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection
offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection
with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its
application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses
challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously
selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring
irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in
resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where
advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To
address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject
Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for
selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is
irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method,
Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC),
which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate
selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the
false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under
both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically
show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while
maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of ridge and ridge-less regression performance with functional covariates from latent metric spaces, showing convergence rates and benign overfitting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond standard i.i.d. assumptions and study predictive performance when covariates are exchangeable functional evaluations from latent spaces with additive noise.

Method: Probabilistic bounds on predictive excess risk using recent results from Barzilai and Shamir, under assumptions of independence across dimensions, 4th-order moments, and other regularity conditions.

Result: Derived convergence rates in regimes where dimension p grows fast relative to sample size n, showing interplay between model ingredients and the role of additive covariate noise in enabling benign overfitting.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical understanding of how functional covariates and additive noise affect regression performance, particularly in high-dimensional settings where p grows faster than n.

Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less
least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$
random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$
random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away
from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$
covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an
assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other
regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive
excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of
recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes
where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between
ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of
additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) with heavy-tailed distributions are not faithful to d-separation, making classical causal discovery algorithms like PC and greedy equivalence search ineffective for recovering the true graph structure.

Method: Study constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs using *-separation criteria. Show PC algorithm consistency with *-separation oracle, and introduce new PCstar algorithm that assumes faithfulness to C*-separation.

Result: PC algorithm remains consistent despite additional conditional independence statements implied by *-separation. PCstar algorithm can orient additional edges that cannot be oriented using only d- or *-separation.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundations for causal discovery in MLBNs, demonstrating that modified separation criteria (*-separation and C*-separation) enable effective constraint-based learning algorithms for these heavy-tailed structural equation models.

Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of
structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have
heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are
typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery
algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be
used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin
the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle
for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that
if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph,
then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI
statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal
discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to
$C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be
oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.

### [307] [Uncertainty-Aware PCA for Arbitrarily Distributed Data Modeled by Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13990)
*Daniel Klötzl,Ozan Tastekin,David Hägele,Marina Evers,Daniel Weiskopf*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes uncertainty-aware PCA using Gaussian mixture models to project non-normal multidimensional distributions to low-dimensional space with better fidelity than existing UAPCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multidimensional data often has uncertainties that aren't well-described by normal distributions, requiring better projection methods that preserve distribution characteristics.

Method: Models distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derives projections from general formulation for arbitrary probability density functions, with support for user-defined weights between distributions.

Result: Low-dimensional projections show more distribution details and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings, validated against sample-based projections.

Conclusion: The proposed GMM-based approach provides superior uncertainty-aware dimensionality reduction for non-normal distributions compared to existing UAPCA methods.

Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not
well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such
distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using
uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model
multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive
the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary
probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities
exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully
compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights
between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of
the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the
distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to
those obtained by sample-based projections.

### [308] [Too Easily Fooled? Prompt Injection Breaks LLMs on Frustratingly Simple Multiple-Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13214)
*Xuyang Guo,Zekai Huang,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to simple hidden prompt injection attacks in PDF files, even on basic arithmetic questions, revealing serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs can be easily misled by prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions are hidden in content, particularly concerning for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer review, and data quality evaluation.

Method: Evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions presented as multiple-choice or true-false judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the file to manipulate outputs.

Result: LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt injection attacks, even in trivial scenarios like basic arithmetic questions.

Conclusion: The study highlights serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications and demonstrates that LLMs can be easily misled by simple prompt injection attacks embedded in content files.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent
abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing
unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer
review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt
injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content
to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore
a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be
easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions
(e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false
judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the
file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt
injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious
robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.

*Yixuan Yang,Daoyuan Wu,Yufan Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: First systematic security analysis of Model Context Protocol (MCP) revealing 17 attack types across 4 surfaces, with over 85% success rate compromising major platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP integration expands LLM attack surfaces but lacks systematic security assessment, creating urgent need for standardized evaluation framework.

Method: Developed MCPSecBench - modular benchmark with prompt datasets, MCP servers/clients, attack scripts to test 17 attack types across 3 major providers.

Result: 85%+ attacks successful against at least one platform; core vulnerabilities universal across Claude/OpenAI/Cursor; prompt/tool attacks show host/model variability.

Conclusion: MCPSecBench establishes standardized MCP security evaluation, enables rigorous testing across all protocol layers, reveals widespread vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a universal, open standard
for connecting AI agents with data sources and external tools. While MCP
enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security
risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first
systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4
primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security
benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP
clients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP
providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to
incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols
for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of
the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core
vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while
prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across
different hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of
MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.

*Soham Hans,Nikolos Gurney,Stacy Marsella,Sofia Hirschmann*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Using LLMs to analyze hacker notes reveals loss aversion cognitive bias in cybersecurity attacks, enabling real-time behavioral analysis for improved defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cyber defense focuses on fortification but fails to dynamically interpret attacks in progress. There's a need to understand and quantify attacker cognitive biases like loss aversion to better defend against unknown adversaries.

Method: Leveraged large language models (LLMs) to process hacker-generated notes from controlled network attacks. Used LLMs to segment actions and correlate them with predefined persistence mechanisms, analyzing implementation patterns against operational triggers.

Result: LLMs effectively dissected nuanced behavioral patterns, providing new insights into how loss aversion manifests in hacker decision-making during cyber attacks.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a transformative approach for real-time, behavior-based cyber defense analysis by quantifying cognitive biases from attacker behavior, enhancing defense strategies through cognitive trait inference.

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying human cognitive biases from empirical data has
long posed a formidable challenge, particularly in cybersecurity, where
defending against unknown adversaries is paramount. Traditional cyber defense
strategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt
to anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities,
yet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In
recognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend
against, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract
quantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker
behavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were
recruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker
generated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and
correlate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By
correlating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational
triggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests
in hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively
dissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a
transformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through
real-time, behavior-based analysis.

### [311] [Involuntary Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13246)
*Yangyang Guo,Yangyan Li,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Researchers discovered a new LLM vulnerability called 'involuntary jailbreak' that can compromise entire guardrail systems using a single universal prompt, affecting major models like Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT 4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal a fundamental weakness in LLM safety mechanisms that differs from traditional jailbreak attacks by potentially compromising the entire guardrail structure rather than targeting specific components.

Method: Using a single universal prompt that instructs LLMs to generate typically rejected questions along with their detailed responses instead of refusal responses.

Result: The simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the majority of leading LLMs, demonstrating surprising fragility in current guardrail systems.

Conclusion: This vulnerability highlights the need for researchers and practitioners to re-evaluate LLM guardrail robustness and develop stronger safety alignment methods for future models.

Abstract: In this study, we disclose a worrying new vulnerability in Large Language
Models (LLMs), which we term \textbf{involuntary jailbreak}. Unlike existing
jailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a
specific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \textit{building
a bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the
LLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise
the entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly
fragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal. In
particular, we instruct LLMs to generate several questions that would typically
be rejected, along with their corresponding in-depth responses (rather than a
refusal). Remarkably, this simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the
majority of leading LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
and GPT 4.1. We hope this problem can motivate researchers and practitioners to
re-evaluate the robustness of LLM guardrails and contribute to stronger safety
alignment in future.

*Tadeu Freitas,Carlos Novo,Inês Dutra,João Soares,Manuel Correia,Benham Shariati,Rolando Martins*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Extended HAL 9000 ITS Risk Manager with custom scraper to mine diverse threat sources beyond NVD/ExploitDB, improving early detection of unverified vulnerabilities and threat response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ITS solutions rely heavily on manual analysis of NVD and ExploitDB, limiting responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000's dependency on these limited sources was a constraint despite its ML capabilities.

Method: Built custom scraper to continuously mine diverse threat sources including security advisories, research forums, and real-time exploit PoCs. Integrated this expanded intelligence with HAL 9000's existing ML framework and Exploitability Probability Scoring system.

Result: Integration of scraper-derived intelligence significantly expanded HAL 9000's knowledge base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities. Evaluation showed substantial improvement in addressing emerging threats.

Conclusion: The extended HAL 9000 with multi-source threat intelligence scraping demonstrates enhanced proactive defense capabilities against rapidly evolving cyber threats, overcoming limitations of traditional vulnerability database dependencies.

Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to
the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS
architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is
prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions
often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust
system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches
rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis
for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's
responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager
introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine
learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts
and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a
system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to
estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive
defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a
limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This
extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse
threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time
exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence
base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.
Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with
HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to
address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the
architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and
the effects on HAL 9000's management.

*Wei Shao,Zequan Liang,Ruoyu Zhang,Ruijie Fang,Ning Miao,Ehsan Kourkchi,Setareh Rafatirad,Houman Homayoun,Chongzhou Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: We-Be Band is a smartwatch-based continuous authentication system using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals with Bi-LSTM attention model, achieving 88.11% accuracy while reducing power consumption by 53% compared to high-frequency systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG-based authentication is intrusive and discontinuous, while high-frequency PPG systems consume too much power for wearable devices. There's a need for practical, energy-efficient continuous authentication on smartwatches.

Method: Uses 25 Hz multi-channel PPG signals with Bi-LSTM neural network and attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from short 4-second windows of 4-channel PPG data.

Result: Achieves 88.11% average accuracy, 0.88 F1-score, 0.48% FAR, 11.77% FRR, and 2.76% EER. Reduces power consumption by 53% vs 512 Hz and 19% vs 128 Hz systems. 25 Hz identified as optimal lower bound.

Conclusion: Low-frequency (25 Hz) PPG enables practical continuous authentication on smartwatches with significant power savings. Activity-diverse training is crucial for robustness across different physiological states.

Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path
toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their
intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit
practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables
continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into
wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency
PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy
and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world
systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and
evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band,
using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a
Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from
short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both
public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate
strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%,
macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection
Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system
reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to
128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz
preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz
while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the
practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on
resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves
robustness across physiological states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL enhances data privacy but remains vulnerable to security threats; need to provide systematic overview of state-of-the-art defense mechanisms and their trade-offs.

Method: Survey methodology analyzing 200+ papers, categorizing techniques into security-enhancing (robustness against malicious behaviors) and privacy-preserving (cryptography, differential privacy, secure aggregation).

Result: Critical analysis of strengths/limitations of existing methods, highlighting privacy-security-performance trade-offs and impact of non-IID data on defense effectiveness.

Conclusion: Identifies need for scalable, adaptive, energy-efficient solutions in dynamic FL environments; provides guidance for developing robust privacy-preserving FL systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm
enabling multiple clients to train a global model collaboratively without
sharing their raw data. While FL enhances data privacy by design, it remains
vulnerable to various security and privacy threats. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of more than 200 papers regarding the state-of-the-art
attacks and defense mechanisms developed to address these challenges,
categorizing them into security-enhancing and privacy-preserving techniques.
Security-enhancing methods aim to improve FL robustness against malicious
behaviors such as byzantine attacks, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. At the same
time, privacy-preserving techniques focus on protecting sensitive data through
cryptographic approaches, differential privacy, and secure aggregation. We
critically analyze the strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlight
the trade-offs between privacy, security, and model performance, and discuss
the implications of non-IID data distributions on the effectiveness of these
defenses. Furthermore, we identify open research challenges and future
directions, including the need for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient
solutions operating in dynamic and heterogeneous FL environments. Our survey
aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing robust and
privacy-preserving FL systems, fostering advancements safeguarding
collaborative learning frameworks' integrity and confidentiality.

TL;DR: DegDiT is a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation that addresses trade-offs between temporal localization, scalability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable text-to-audio generation face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency, requiring a more comprehensive solution.

Method: Encodes events as structured dynamic graphs with nodes representing semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. Uses graph transformer for contextualized event embeddings to guide diffusion model. Includes quality-balanced data selection pipeline and consensus preference optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performances on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets across various objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DegDiT successfully addresses the challenges in controllable audio generation by combining dynamic event graphs, diffusion transformers, and consensus optimization to achieve precise control over both content and temporal structure.

Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual
descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event
types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables
precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated
audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs
among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and
practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel
dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary
controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as
structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent
three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event
connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and
produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the
diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce
a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event
annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset
with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference
optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple
reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime
datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across
a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark and quantify how much identity information remains in speech after de-identification, revealing privacy risks in current technologies.

Method: Introduced a benchmark using three complementary error rates: equal error rate, cumulative match characteristic hit rate, and embedding-space similarity measured via canonical correlation analysis and Procrustes analysis.

Result: All state-of-the-art speaker de-identification systems leak identity information. Best system performs only slightly better than random guessing, worst system achieves 45% hit rate within top 50 candidates.

Conclusion: Current speaker de-identification technologies have persistent privacy risks and significant identity leakage, highlighting the need for improved methods.

Abstract: Speaker de-identification aims to conceal a speaker's identity while
preserving intelligibility of the underlying speech. We introduce a benchmark
that quantifies residual identity leakage with three complementary error rates:
equal error rate, cumulative match characteristic hit rate, and embedding-space
similarity measured via canonical correlation analysis and Procrustes analysis.
Evaluation results reveal that all state-of-the-art speaker de-identification
systems leak identity information. The highest performing system in our
evaluation performs only slightly better than random guessing, while the lowest
performing system achieves a 45% hit rate within the top 50 candidates based on
CMC. These findings highlight persistent privacy risks in current speaker

TL;DR: Systematic survey of log usage across databases, data warehouses, web, and knowledge graphs analyzing 300+ publications to identify common characteristics, standard pipelines, and constraints in log exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital interactions leave valuable traces in logs, but research on log usage remains fragmented across domains with no comprehensive study consolidating existing efforts.

Method: Analyzed more than 300 publications to address three central questions about common structural/functional characteristics, standard pipelines, and constraints/NFRs guiding log exploitation.

Result: Revealed limited end-to-end approaches, absence of standardization across log usage pipelines, and existence of shared structural elements among different log types.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive overview of log usage, identifies gaps, highlights opportunities for future research, particularly regarding KG log exploitation and democratization.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D scene reconstruction performance by efficiently integrating multiple data modalities (RGB, depth, semantics) while reducing training time and better distinguishing noise from actual scene details.

Method: Uses SG-MLP sampling structure with PR-MLP for voxel pre-rendering to capture scene information earlier, combined with progressive semantic modeling that extracts semantic information at increasing precision levels.

Result: Achieved best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU metrics on seven synthetic scenes, while maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness.

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf demonstrates effective and practical 3D scene reconstruction with improved performance metrics and reduced training time through integrated multi-modal data processing.

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE enables 3D-aware video editing using sketches for precise geometry control, handling significant viewpoint changes through 3D point cloud manipulation and depth-aware content alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing structural content in videos with significant viewpoint changes (large camera rotations/zooms) is challenging due to difficulties in generating novel view content consistent with original video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D outputs.

Method: Uses sketch-based interaction for precise geometry control; employs image editing for first frame, then propagates to remaining frames; utilizes dense stereo method for point cloud and camera parameter estimation; proposes point cloud editing with depth maps for 3D geometry alignment; introduces 3D-aware mask propagation and video diffusion model for seamless merging.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority in video editing, particularly for handling significant viewpoint changes while maintaining consistency and realism.

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE effectively addresses the challenges of 3D-aware video editing with viewpoint changes through its sketch-based approach, 3D geometry manipulation, and diffusion-based realistic video generation.

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

TL;DR: Is-NeRF is a novel deblur neural radiance field that uses explicit lightpath modeling and in-scattering representation to handle motion-blurred images and complex light propagation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NeRF methods use straight-line volume rendering which struggles with sophisticated lightpath scenarios and introduces geometric ambiguities, especially when processing motion-blurred images.

Method: Proposes a scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline that unifies six common light propagation phenomena through in-scattering representation, with adaptive learning strategy for determining scattering directions and sampling intervals, jointly optimizing NeRF parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show the method effectively handles complex real-world scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate geometric details.

Conclusion: Is-NeRF successfully addresses limitations of traditional NeRF by incorporating explicit lightpath modeling and scattering-aware rendering, enabling better handling of motion blur and complex light propagation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

### [321] [COMPASS: A Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Evaluating Code Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13757)
*James Meaden,Michał Jarosz,Piotr Jodłowski,Grigori Melnik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: COMPASS is a new benchmark that evaluates code generation across correctness, efficiency, and quality dimensions using 50 real Codility problems, revealing that models with high correctness often produce inefficient or unmaintainable code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus only on functional correctness while ignoring algorithmic efficiency and code quality, which are critical for real-world programming applications.

Method: Developed COMPASS framework with 50 competitive programming problems from Codility competitions, using industry-standard analysis tools to systematically evaluate runtime efficiency and code quality alongside correctness.

Result: Evaluation of leading models (Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, O4-Mini-High) shows that high correctness scores don't guarantee efficient algorithms or maintainable code.

Conclusion: COMPASS highlights the need for multi-dimensional evaluation beyond just correctness to assess real-world code generation capabilities and guide development of production-ready AI systems.

Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness
while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic
efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional
Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses
code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality.
COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility
competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions.
Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions
identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS
systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using
industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading
reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do
not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These
findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to
truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS
serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI
systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

*Zhouyu Li,Zhijing Yang,Huayue Gu,Xiaojian Wang,Yuchen Liu,Ruozhou Yu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: OrbitChain is a collaborative analytics framework for Earth observation constellations that enables real-time analytics by distributing computational tasks across multiple satellites, reducing communication overhead and increasing workload capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Earth observation systems suffer from significant delays (hours to days) in data download and analysis due to limited bandwidth and ground-satellite connection durations, making real-time applications like disaster response impossible.

Method: OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices, allocates computational resources across satellites, uses a traffic routing algorithm to minimize inter-satellite communication overhead, and implements a pipeline workflow for real-time task completion.

Result: Experiments show OrbitChain can complete up to 60% more analytics workload than existing frameworks while reducing communication overhead by up to 72%.

Conclusion: OrbitChain enables real-time Earth observation analytics and facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations, addressing the limitations of current satellite data processing systems.

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive
applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of
ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and
analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time
demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics,
we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates
computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation
constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices
and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic
routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication
overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth
observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and
inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain,
we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show
that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth
observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up
to 72%.

### [325] [Goal-Directedness is in the Eye of the Beholder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13247)
*Nina Rajcic,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Goal-directedness cannot be objectively measured in agent systems due to technical and conceptual problems with both behavioral and mechanistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of current methods for predicting complex agent behavior through goal attribution and identify fundamental problems in formalizing goals.

Method: Analyzing the assumptions behind behavioral and mechanistic approaches to goal-directedness, identifying technical and conceptual problems with both methods.

Result: Goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively through either behavioral observation or internal model state probing due to inherent limitations in both approaches.

Conclusion: New directions are needed to model goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic, multi-agent systems rather than attempting objective measurement.

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the
attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors:
Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be
estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe
for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both
approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from
formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising
position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new
directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic,
multi-agent systems.

*Zihan Guo,Yuanjian Zhou,Chenyi Wang,Linlin You,Minjie Bian,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: BetaWeb is a blockchain-based framework that addresses privacy, data management, and value measurement challenges in LLM-based multi-agent systems, enabling trustworthy and scalable autonomous interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic ecosystems are fragmented and closed, with existing centralized paradigms unable to support large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions due to privacy, data management, and value measurement challenges.

Method: The paper introduces BetaWeb, a blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web framework that leverages blockchain's inherent strengths to provide a scalable infrastructure for LLM-based multi-agent systems, with a five-stage evolutionary roadmap from passive execution to autonomous governance.

Result: BetaWeb offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure that can advance Web paradigms from Web3 (data ownership) to Web3.5 (agent capability ownership and intelligence monetization), enabling resilient and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystems.

Conclusion: Deep integration between blockchain and LLM-based multi-agent systems can establish the foundation for a trustworthy, resilient, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem, addressing core challenges in current agentic implementations.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are
increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based
multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain
fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for
Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an
open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still
faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value
measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from
inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,
heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic
Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not
only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has
the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data
ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and
the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the
BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,
outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration
and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing
products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.
Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay
the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized
digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is
available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

*Jan Krejčí,Oliver Kost,Yuxuan Xia,Lennart Svensson,Ondřej Straka*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper applies radar-based multi-object tracking methods to pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding boxes, employing a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter with standard point-object model, but reveals model-data mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pedestrian tracking problems using 2D bounding box detections by adapting multi-object tracking methods from radar tracking community.

Method: Uses standard point-object model and computes posterior density with Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. Parameters are selected from first principles and identified from MOT-17 dataset data.

Result: The PMBM algorithm shows promising results but reveals a mismatch between the standard point-object model and the actual data.

Conclusion: The model-based approach suggests that modifying problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Safe distributed multi-agent optimization using Bayesian optimization with custom spatio-temporal kernel for sample-efficient safety-critical applications


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many safety-critical real-world problems like autonomous driving and collaborative robots require distributed multi-agent optimization with safety guarantees, but prior work lacks sample efficiency or doesn't handle unknown nonconvex rewards/constraints

Method: Safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression using nearest-neighbor communication, reformulating global optimization as time-varying local optimization with custom spatio-temporal kernel

Result: Successful deployment in simulations showing effective optimization while ensuring safety

Conclusion: Proposed approach enables safe, sample-efficient distributed optimization for multi-agent systems with unknown nonconvex rewards and constraints

Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and
collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the
performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as
distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their
parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled
constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider
safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency
and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this
optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process
regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the
agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the
static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem
for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end,
we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We
show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.
